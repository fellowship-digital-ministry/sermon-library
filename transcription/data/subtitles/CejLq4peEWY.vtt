00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
chapter tonight, Genesis 48, it's only 22 verses,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.039
and this is message number 97 through the book of Genesis,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.880
and we are near the very end,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.840
and chapter 49 and then chapter 50.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.120
I do not believe that I will be able to get

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.200
through chapter 49 in one message,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.799
it's probably gonna take two,

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:24.000
and then probably two for chapter 50 as well,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but we are nearing the end,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.079
and I have been praying about where to go

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.379
on Sunday evenings for our new series,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.880
it's been a long time that we've been

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.720
in the book of Genesis, and obviously message 97,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.700
but also we had some other things going on

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
on Sunday evenings, different periods of time,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400
I did a period of time where we did

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.880
Ask the Pastor on Sunday night, and what have you,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.360
and so it's been a number of years

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119
that we've been sending through the book of Genesis,

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.439
and by the way, let me say this,

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.959
I'm thankful for, we heard testimonies tonight,

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:55.599
Brother Mark and Brother Isaac,

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:57.200
they both said about God's word,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
I'm thankful for Genesis to Revelation, amen,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.959
and all God's word is profitable,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.440
the Bible says all scripture is given

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.519
by inspiration of God, and is profitable

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:10.559
in the context of 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:12.639
we know that Paul says to Timothy,

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:17.000
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.120
what's he talking about, he's talking about

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.559
the Old Testament, which are able

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:22.919
to make thee wise unto salvation,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:26.599
and what a blessing, Paul says to the folks

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.879
in Rome, to the people in Corinth,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.319
that God's word, that which was written aforetime,

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.360
was written for our learning, written for our admonition,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480
and I am thankful for the Old Testament,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.319
God gives us very important principles,

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.000
and I am thankful for those principles,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.959
and what a blessing to have God's word.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.760
In Genesis chapter 47, we spent two weeks

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.400
looking at that portion of scripture,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.720
and through Genesis 47, we learn

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.120
that God used Joseph to take care of his family,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.839
and of course, we know that Jacob was called for by Joseph

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:03.440
as the brothers went back with the goods,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.239
and said, Joseph is alive, and he said to return,

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.399
and we find that as they were preparing to depart,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.679
that God appeared to Jacob in chapter number 46,

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.479
and said, go, and I'll be with thee,

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.440
and in that place, I will build of thee a great nation,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
and we find that God was doing just that,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.839
and we read of that in chapter 47,

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.720
we learned how God provided for his people,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.279
they received a place, and they received the best place,

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.080
according to Genesis 47,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.279
and we find that not only did they have a place,

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.039
but they received provision,

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.080
and they had their needs taken care of,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320
I'm thankful that as our shepherd,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.759
that God gives us all that we need,

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.559
he provides for us, he is a good God,

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.639
he is a good shepherd, and I'm thankful for that.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.080
We find, the Bible tells us, there in Genesis 47,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.279
the end of the chapter, in verse 28,

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.279
that Jacob lived there in Egypt for 17 years.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.559
As we enter into Genesis chapter 48,

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.559
we find that the text of scripture begins

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.919
by informing us that Jacob is sick,

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.199
we find that this sickness that is mentioned

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.000
is obviously a serious situation,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.600
for upon hearing of the news,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.600
Joseph gets a word of the circumstances of the situation,

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.039
he gets his two boys, Ephraim and Manasseh,

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.639
or Manasseh and Ephraim, oldest youngest,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.240
we find that he gets his two sons,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.520
and he heads over, I would say this,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880
to have a visit with his dad.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.639
We find that the text of scripture,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.119
the details of this meeting,

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.520
are provided here in Genesis 48.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.320
I'll begin reading in verse number one,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320
the Bible says this, and it came to pass

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.639
after these things, after those 17 years

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.600
in which they were there in Egypt,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.160
that one told Joseph, notice the message,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.759
behold, thy father is sick,

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.960
and he, Joseph, took with him his two sons,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.000
Manasseh and Ephraim, and one told Jacob

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.639
and said, behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee,

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.639
and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.240
We'll read the entirety of the text this evening,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.800
but I wanna give you, you know, it's amazing,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.880
the Bible is an awesome book, it's a living book,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.679
and I said this this morning,

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.359
but I'll say it again this evening,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.040
the best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.720
I don't know who originally coined that phrase,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.160
I know that I heard Clarence Sexton say that

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.440
a number of times during his ministry,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.679
but the Bible is an awesome book,

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.480
it's a living book, it is God's word,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.000
and I want you to hold your place here in Genesis 48,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.600
but take with me just for a moment

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600
over to Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.519
In Hebrews chapter number 11,

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:45.720
God gives us just a simple verse of scripture

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.799
that really in this simple verse of scripture,

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:51.359
I believe that great light is shed

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:55.440
upon the meeting that we read of in Genesis 48,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.799
and we find that in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:01.040
many of us would refer to this passage of scripture

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.320
as the great hall of faith, if you will,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.279
and we read of all of the great things

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.799
that were accomplished, and we find that in verse 21,

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:12.000
notice what the Bible says in Hebrews 11 and verse 21,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
by faith Jacob, when he was a dying,

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.799
blessed both the sons of Joseph.

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.600
That's what we're talking about in Genesis 48,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.440
that is, Genesis 48 is the record

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.160
of what is being referred to here

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.559
in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 21,

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.880
when Jacob is going to die

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.600
and he blesses the two sons of Joseph.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.880
The other blessings are recorded in Genesis 49

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.480
for the other sons, but the sons of Joseph in chapter 48,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480
notice this next phrase that says,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.040
and worshiped, and worshiped,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.399
leaning upon the top of his staff.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.839
Why did he have a staff?

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.119
Because he wrestled with the Lord one night

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.239
and God touched his thigh, right?

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:08.519
And I believe that for the rest of his days, he had a limp.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.000
And he remembered, I preached on this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.799
when we dealt with that passage of scripture,

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.000
but it really comes up again

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.399
as we look at this tonight in Genesis 48,

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.880
and so we see that he's leaning upon his staff,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.119
and it's not just because of his old age,

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.119
it's not just because of the health circumstances

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:29.440
that are leading to his death

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.519
that we're speaking of in Genesis 48,

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:34.760
but we find that he had that staff for a long time,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.480
and it was a reminder of an event

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.519
that took place in his life,

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:41.399
but I want you to see also that in Hebrews 11, verse 21,

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.799
it says that he worshiped, that he worshiped.

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.480
Now, I like that, I was beginning

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.200
as I was preparing this week

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.399
and looking through this portion of scripture in Genesis 48,

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.239
and I was reminded of Hebrews 11,

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.720
and I'm thinking as I'm reading through the context,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.839
turn back to Genesis 48, if you will,

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.480
and as you're reading through the context,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.679
if you're not careful, you can look at Genesis 48

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:08.480
and just look at a meeting between a father and a son,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.880
and two grandsons, and you can look at a discussion,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.959
an interaction that's taking place,

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:17.959
but indeed, God says he worshiped, he worshiped.

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:23.000
By the way, God is worthy of our worship.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.559
He alone is to be worshiped.

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:27.799
The word worship means chiefly and eminently

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:32.799
the act of paying divine honors to the supreme being.

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:37.700
Of course, we know that is our Lord and Savior.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.660
I'm so thankful that the God of the universe is my father.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.899
Isn't that awesome?

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:43.380
You think about that, our heavenly father,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.059
the God of the universe, the one who said,

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.859
"'Let there be light,' and there was light."

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:49.700
And we find that in Genesis 48,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.779
as God gives us the record of this interaction

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.220
and the people that are there,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.440
the setting, the conversation,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.579
but the Bible says that he worshiped.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.820
Keep that in mind as we go through the text this evening.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.100
I've titled the message really here in verse number 14.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.940
The Bible says, in Israel,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.700
Jacob stretched out his right hand

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.660
and laid it upon Ephraim's head,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.320
who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.619
Notice it says, guiding his hands wittingly,

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:20.820
for Manasseh was the firstborn.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.859
And I've just titled the message,

00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:24.859
Jacob guided his hands wittingly.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.660
As we look at this portion of scripture,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.779
I want you to notice a few thoughts this evening.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:31.059
Number one, notice his praise.

00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:34.840
Notice the praise of Jacob in this text of scripture.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.799
We find that Joseph arrives,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.320
Jacob is told that Joseph is coming,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.080
and it says that Israel, in the end of verse number two,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.760
that he strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.159
And notice in verse three,

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.559
this is where we begin to see the praise of Jacob.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:53.760
It says, and Jacob said unto Joseph,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.520
notice how he's praising the Lord,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.119
and by the way, praise is part of worship.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.520
We find that the Bible says that Jacob says to Joseph,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.520
God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz,

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:11.880
and the land of Canaan, notice what he says,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.140
and blessed me.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.799
And, notice verse number four,

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:21.159
and said unto me, behold, I will make thee fruitful,

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.559
and multiply thee, and I will make of thee

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:26.799
a multitude of people, and will give this land

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:31.520
to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.679
And so we find that in verse number three and four,

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:37.719
that Jacob, Israel, as he's meeting with his son

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:41.919
and his grandsons, as he's nearing the end of his life,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:46.919
he's going to die, the Bible says that this meeting begins

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.159
with praise.

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:52.039
That Jacob is looking back to the past,

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:55.479
he's looking at what God has done for him,

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:57.919
and how God has worked in his life.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.239
He says, God appeared to me.

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:04.779
he says, God blessed me, he said, God has promised me.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:07.279
Notice, if you will, in verse number 15,

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:10.559
the Bible says this after he guides his hands

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.959
wittingly in verse 14, the Bible says in verse 15,

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:16.419
and he blessed Joseph and said,

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:21.419
God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.139
the God, notice what he says,

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:28.139
which fed me all my life long unto this day.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:31.139
You know what Jacob's doing?

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:34.859
He's recognizing the blessings of God.

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:37.179
He is praising the Lord.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.579
He's taking the opportunity.

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:44.579
And by the way, our kids ought to hear us praise God, amen.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.459
Our grandkids ought to hear us.

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:47.459
If you have children,

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:49.419
if you are blessed to have grandchildren,

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:50.979
they ought to hear you praise the Lord.

00:10:50.979 --> 00:10:53.399
They ought to know that God is real in your life.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:55.379
They ought to know that God's answering prayer,

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:58.619
that God's working and what God has done.

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:00.319
Listen, the kids in our church,

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.899
they need to hear it from their parents

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:02.859
and from their grandparents,

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:05.299
but they need to hear it from other church members.

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:06.999
The Bible speaks of in the book of Titus

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.059
about the aged women and the aged men

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.019
and the roles and the responsibilities

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:13.299
and how we invest in that next generation

00:11:13.299 --> 00:11:15.539
and they're able to see that our God is real

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:19.919
and our God works and our God, he is worthy of our praise.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:21.739
And we find this evening that is,

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:26.259
I want you to think about Joseph and Manasseh and Ephraim

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:28.819
entering into the presence of Jacob.

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:33.379
These grandsons of Jacob, of Israel's grandsons,

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.959
these boys were born in Egypt.

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.979
All they knew was Egypt.

00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:43.499
In just a few moments, we're gonna continue to read,

00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:45.459
we find that really what Jacob does

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.579
is he adopts these boys as his own

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:52.139
for the purpose of the blessing that he's going to give.

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:54.539
But I want you to recognize that as Jacob

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:58.579
is speaking to his boys, to his son and to his grandsons,

00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:02.019
he wants them to know the God of the universe.

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.139
He says, notice how he begins.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.059
He says to Joseph, but the boys are there.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.059
Now, I understand that Jacob,

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.339
as we go through the text of scripture,

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:11.419
he actually is not fully aware

00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:13.059
that the boys are there for this meeting.

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:14.619
He finds out a little bit later.

00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:17.499
His eyesight, he cannot see, all right?

00:12:18.219 --> 00:12:19.139
So he's told that Joseph is there,

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:23.099
but I want you to think about what Manasseh and Ephraim heard.

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:28.099
God Almighty, God Almighty appeared to me.

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:32.819
God promised me, he blessed me.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:37.579
God has taken care of me, he has provided for me.

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:39.579
It's important for a next generation

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:43.179
to know how God has provided for us.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.819
Listen, I understand that God has given many people

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:49.219
a good career and a good opportunity

00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:51.939
and so on and so forth, but we better recognize

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:56.379
that it's God's hand of blessing, amen?

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:57.779
Deuteronomy says it's God

00:12:57.779 --> 00:12:59.859
that gives you the ability to get wealth.

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:05.419
And we better recognize that it's not just in our ability

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:07.859
and our talents, no, God gave us those talents

00:13:07.859 --> 00:13:10.819
and those abilities, he gave us those opportunities,

00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:14.459
and we find that Jacob says that God fed me

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:17.419
all my life long unto this day.

00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:21.259
I mean, those are good lessons for Joseph

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.699
and for Manasseh and Ephraim as he's praising the Lord,

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:28.459
as he's worshiping here in this meeting

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:30.059
with Joseph and his boys.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.859
We see the praise, I've said this

00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:35.579
for my second thought this evening, his present.

00:13:35.579 --> 00:13:38.559
We see that really the praise is dealing with the past,

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.019
but notice in the present what's taking place.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.899
In verse number five, it says, and now thy two sons,

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.819
thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh,

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:48.859
which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt

00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:50.859
before I came unto thee into Egypt,

00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:52.959
notice what he says, they are mine.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:58.539
As Reuben and Simeon, they, speaking of Manasseh and Ephraim,

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:01.739
they shall be mine.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.459
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them,

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.319
shall be thine and shall be called

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:11.759
after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:12.959
You know, when they divide the land,

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:17.959
there's the tribe of Manasseh and the tribe of Ephraim,

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.559
because Jacob says they are mine.

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:22.919
He adopts them.

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:26.039
But notice as it continues, he says in verse number seven,

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:28.519
as for me, when I came from Paddan,

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:32.279
Rachel died by me in the land of Cana in the way,

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:36.079
when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath,

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:38.799
and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath,

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:41.000
the same as Bethlehem.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.679
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said, who are these?

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.599
He could not see, we're gonna see that in a moment.

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:47.319
In verse nine, Joseph said unto his father,

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:50.319
they are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.

00:14:50.319 --> 00:14:52.199
And he said, bring them, I pray thee unto me,

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.479
and I will bless them.

00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:54.919
And so it's very interesting,

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:58.199
Jacob is saying the things about Manasseh and Ephraim

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:01.759
really without having the visual understanding

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:03.160
that they're there present.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.679
He's not saying what he said in the previous verses

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:07.639
just because of their presence.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:10.119
He's saying it because he's prophesying

00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:13.319
about what will be.

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:16.199
And we find that now he says, the boys,

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:17.319
he says, bring them to me.

00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:21.839
In verse number 10, now the eyes of Israel were dim for age

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.599
so that he could not see.

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.359
And he brought them near unto him

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.119
and he kissed them and embraced them.

00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:31.759
Can you imagine in your mind's eye that setting?

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.959
I think that's a sweet moment

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.759
just a human relationship type of moment.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.319
But notice the Bible says in verse number 11,

00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:42.279
and Israel said unto Joseph,

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:44.639
notice what he says when he's rejoicing again

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.199
with regard to his present,

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:48.039
he speaks as we think about his praise

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:50.880
with regard to the past and what God has done,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.359
but God was still working and blessing.

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:55.519
In verse 11, Israel said unto Joseph,

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:59.000
I had not thought to see thy face.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.119
No doubt, Jacob had no thought

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:04.759
that he would ever see Joseph again.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:07.039
In his mind, Joseph was dead.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:10.359
He'd been told a story.

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:14.519
He'd been led to believe a lie.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:17.239
The brothers bring back a coat of many colors

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:19.000
that was dipped in blood

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:22.639
and simply said, do you know whose this is?

00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:26.959
They were certain that Jacob would be able

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.319
to recognize that coat of many colors.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.959
And Joseph, the owner of that coat,

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:36.279
the one that Jacob had bestowed that coat upon,

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:39.000
he says, Joseph, no doubt as rent in pieces

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.160
an evil beast hath devoured him.

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:46.000
And he had no thought that he would ever see his son again.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.199
And he says in verse number 11, notice,

00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:49.919
think about the praise and the setting.

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.959
He said, I had not thought to see thy face

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:56.959
and lo, God hath showed me also thy seed.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:01.160
Not only has God blessed me to be able

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.119
to see you, my son, again,

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:07.199
but I've had the opportunity to see your children.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.039
Now remember, he was there for 17 years.

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:15.479
This is when he's sick and he's going to die.

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:18.799
I don't know, the Bible does not record for us

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:22.720
those 17 years, the details of any interactions

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.319
between Joseph and Jacob and his family.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.039
We have no idea, God doesn't give us all of that,

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:32.599
but we find that for 17 years, Jacob lived in Egypt.

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:35.919
And Jacob says, I didn't think I'd see you

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:39.239
and God's been so good to me to allow me

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:40.799
not only to see your face again,

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:43.679
but to see grandchildren.

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.679
That's a blessing.

00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:49.799
And again, Jacob is recognizing God.

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.399
He's worshiping the Lord.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.359
I want you to notice as we continue reading

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:58.160
throughout the end of the chapter, his prophecy.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.440
We see the prophecy, the blessing, if you will,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.519
in verse number 12, the Bible says that Joseph

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:05.199
brought them out from between his knees

00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:07.959
and he bowed himself with his face to the earth

00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:11.119
and Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:14.799
toward Israel's left hand, Manasseh in his left hand

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:18.519
toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto him.

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.119
And so in your mind's eye this evening,

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:23.440
if you could picture that Jacob is here

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.519
and Joseph is here and Joseph's going to present

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:29.319
his two sons to his father.

00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:32.160
And Jacob is sitting, the Bible said that he got himself,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.000
he strengthened himself and got on the side of the bed there

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.039
and the Bible says that Jacob is there

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.359
and so his left is here, his right is here,

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:42.719
but Joseph takes Ephraim and he puts Ephraim

00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:45.679
to the left hand of Jacob.

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:48.599
And he puts Manasseh to the right hand of Jacob.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.919
Now why is that?

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:52.279
Well, because the right hand in that culture

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:54.239
would signify the blessing.

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:58.279
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:02.599
that as Joseph put them in that position,

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:05.640
remember, Jacob could not see.

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:09.839
So Joseph takes it upon himself to put the boys

00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:13.320
in the order in which he believes they are to be.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.880
And the Bible says in verse 14,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.159
and Israel stretched out his right hand.

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:21.599
And notice it says that he laid it upon Ephraim's head.

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:26.159
So he does like this, he doesn't go like this,

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:27.880
he goes like this.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.000
And then the Bible says, who was the younger

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.239
in his left hand upon Manasseh's head.

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:38.279
So he has his hands like this.

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:41.839
And we find that the Bible says,

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:45.359
guiding his hands wittingly.

00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:49.880
For Manasseh was the firstborn.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.880
So Manasseh's directly across from his right hand,

00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:58.440
but that's not the one that's received the blessing.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.640
It's Ephraim that's to receive the blessing.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.240
And we find that it says that he guided his hand.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.800
This was not some mistake.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.320
In fact, Joseph, if you look, it says in verse 15,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.600
and he blessed Joseph and said,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.640
God, before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, did walk,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.180
the God which fed me all my life long until this day,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.360
the angel which redeemed me from all evil,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.120
bless the lads and let my name be named on them

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.360
in the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.200
and let them grow into the multitude

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200
in the midst of the earth.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.080
Do you see, remember, in verse number four,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.360
he said, they're mine, I'm adopting them, they are mine.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.440
And we find that he says, let my name,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.840
in the name, let my name be named on them.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.560
That they would understand that they're not Egyptians.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.280
Right, that's what he's saying.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.200
They're Hebrews, they're to be my descendants,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.280
and Jacob's name changed to Israel.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.100
And we find that it says in verse 16,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.640
that it says that let them grow into a multitude

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.480
in the midst of the earth.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.640
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.840
upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.040
And he held up his father's hand to remove it

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.760
from Ephraim's head into Manasseh's head.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.520
And Joseph said to his father, not so, my father,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.880
for this is the firstborn,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.360
put thy right hand upon his head, in verse 18.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.700
So we find that Joseph is standing here,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.800
he puts the sons out in the order

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.400
in which he believes it's to be.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.920
And we find that after Jacob is blessing the boys,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.840
and Joseph recognizes, no, no, no, you have it wrong.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.280
And he's gonna try to remove the hand

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.920
and put them in the right place.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.380
Notice the Bible says in verse 19, and his father refused.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.760
Notice what he says, he says, I know it, my son.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.280
I know it.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.480
He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.420
But truly, his younger brother shall be greater than he.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.200
And his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.640
It says in verse 20, and he blessed them that day,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.200
saying, in thee shall Israel bless,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.720
saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.960
And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.720
And Israel said unto Joseph, behold, I die,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.720
but God shall be with you and bring you again

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.080
unto the land of your fathers.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.040
Moreover, I have given to thee one portion

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.440
above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.560
of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.600
As we look at this prophecy, if you will, the blessing,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.320
we find that the younger Ephraim shall be greater,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.000
and we find that he, Jacob, was guiding his hands wittingly.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
He is in this position.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.400
Remember, we spoke about the original praise,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.400
and he's speaking about the past and the present,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.200
but then we see the prophecy,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.680
and he's prophesying about what will be.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.960
He has confidence in the God that he serves

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.240
as to what God is going to do.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.120
And we find that it's certainly true.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.160
If you turn to the book of Numbers, Numbers chapter one,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.440
notice what the Bible tells us in Numbers one.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.600
Numbers chapter one, I want you to see a couple of things.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.280
We'll look in chapter one and two,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.440
but in Numbers chapter one, notice in verse number 33.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.440
Numbers one and verse 33, it says,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.560
those that were numbered of them,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.240
even of the tribe of Ephraim, were 40,500.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.160
Now, that's the tribe of Ephraim.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.000
He's the younger, but he was the one

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.840
that was to receive the blessing,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.600
and we find that it says that it was 40,500.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.680
In verse 34, the children of Manasseh,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.600
by their generations, after their families,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.880
by the house of their fathers,

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.720
according to the number of their names,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.320
from 20 years old and upward,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.640
all that were able to go forth to war,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.840
those that were numbered of them,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.120
even of the tribe of Manasseh, were 32,200.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.720
So 32,200, a difference of 8,300.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.320
Ephraim has the larger tribe.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.800
In chapter number two, in verse number 18,

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.960
Israel and their camp and how they would be set up

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.240
is outlined for us in Numbers chapter two,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.680
as they would be set up around the tabernacle,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.600
and we find that in verse number 18,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.480
it talks about the west side, and notice what it says.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.040
On the west side shall be the standard

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.400
of the camp of Ephraim, according to their armies,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.480
and the captain of the sons of Ephraim

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.040
shall be Elishamah, the son of Amahud,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.280
and his host, and those that were numbered of them

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.280
were 40,500, and by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.560
and the captain of the children of Manasseh

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.440
shall be Gamaliel, the son of Padazar,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.360
and his host, and those that were numbered of them

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.540
were 32,200, and also it was the tribe of Benjamin

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.740
that would be there on the west side.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.280
But again, we find that even as you look

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.520
at this prophecy from Jacob in Genesis chapter 48,

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.120
and the blessing that is given,

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.120
we find certainly that Manasseh would not have the place,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.440
though he was the firstborn, it would be Ephraim

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.720
that received that blessing.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.560
We go through all of this, and we find this evening

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.880
that as Jacob is looking, as we look through

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.680
this text of scripture, and look at the interaction,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.640
but when we couple it with the truth

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.400
of Hebrews 11 and verse 21, we find that throughout

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.400
this interaction, Jacob worshiped, he worshiped.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.640
As I begin to think about Jacob worshiping,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.160
I believe that really we could look at it in three phases

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.920
as I've already mentioned as we've gone through

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.980
the thoughts this evening, but Jacob worshiped God

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.840
for what he did, for what God did.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.240
Jacob worshiped God, he praised God for what God was doing,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.280
and then he also worshiped because of what God will do.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.600
Begin to think about our own lives,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.880
and begin to think about worship

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.320
and the importance of worship,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.680
and I said this on Wednesday evening,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.440
and I've said it before from the pulpit

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.120
that not all that's called worship today is truly worship.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.560
A lot of places around the country today

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.040
that had a service at a place that they called church

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.000
and said that they were worshiping,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.520
but I would say to you that it really wasn't

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.840
biblical worship, see because God is a spirit,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.240
according to John chapter number four,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.120
and they that worship him must worship him

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.780
in spirit and in truth.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.000
You think about the Old Testament,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.600
what a great picture God gives us in the Old Testament.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.040
The people of Israel could not just decide

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.340
to approach God any way they chose to.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.360
They had to approach God on God's terms.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.320
They had to approach God God's way.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.400
God prescribed the way for his people

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.520
to approach him and to worship him,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.380
and when they did not follow the prescribed way,

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.720
it was met with judgment.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.960
In fact, there were times in which you find

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.820
even in the Old Testament when the people of God,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.600
the children of Israel, sought to worship God,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.040
but their heart wasn't right with God.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.800
You know what God says of those outward expressions?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.120
He says, I don't want them.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.800
Don't bring your offerings, don't do, why?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.360
Because your heart is far from me.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.040
See, God knows our heart, God knows,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.360
and when we gather together for worship

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.600
and we speak about worship and the importance of worship,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.160
I want you to look at a couple of passages with me

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.340
and consider the importance of worship,

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.020
and as the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.540
that in this setting, Jacob worshiped.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.540
What was he doing?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.300
He was acknowledging God.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.020
You know, sometimes what happens if we're not careful

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.100
is we can get to the end of our life

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.940
or even in the midst of our life,

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.380
not even being in Jacob's position

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.780
of being at the end of his life,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.380
but we can be in the middle of our life

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.500
at some point in our life,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.660
and we can try to tell other people how good we are

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.020
and how, man, how we've made it

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.180
in all of these successes that we've had in our lives,

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.640
and look at my life and look what I've accomplished.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.600
But Jacob, he says, let me tell you what God has done.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.340
Let me tell you how God met with me.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.660
Let me tell you how God blessed me.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.060
Let me tell you how God promised me.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.940
Let me tell you how God provided for me.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.260
Let me explain to you what I expect God to continue to do.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.100
Why?

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.140
Because God always honors his word.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.340
He always does what he says he's going to do.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.059
Turn over, if you will, to 2 Chronicles.

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:44.660
I want you to see a passage of scripture

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.380
in 2 Chronicles 29,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.100
and it's a period of time in Israel's history

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.619
where they have revival under the ministry,

00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:55.420
really the leadership, Hezekiah is the king of Judah

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.260
at this particular time in Judah's history.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.580
We find that they have revival during his reign as king.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.340
It's not the only time we find

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.580
that Judah had revival.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.140
They had revival during the time of Jehoshaphat.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.500
They had revival during the time of Josiah.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.100
But we see here in Hezekiah's reign,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.940
it's very interesting what happens.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.140
And as we begin to,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.660
we're just jumping right in the middle

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.140
of a passage of scripture

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.260
and how they were cleansing the house of the Lord

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.619
and all that they did.

00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:26.859
And the Bible begins to talk about this revival.

00:29:26.859 --> 00:29:28.059
And I want you to pick it up with me

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:29.739
in 2 Chronicles 29.

00:29:29.739 --> 00:29:32.780
And I want you to see what God's people did

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:34.940
and how they worship.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.179
The Bible says in verse 28,

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.900
and all the congregation worshiped

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.780
and the singers sang.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.660
You know, singing is part of worship.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.780
Singing is part of worship.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.260
When we sing, we're not trying to bring

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.859
any kind of acknowledgement, recognition to ourselves.

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:56.380
No, the real true heart of those that are singing

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.739
ought to be to worship our God,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.980
to sing praise.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.980
He's unto His name.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.480
The Bible says that we're to sing

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.720
and to make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.940
We find that the Bible says that they were singing,

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.580
they worshiped and the singer sang

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.420
and the trumpeters sounded.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.260
Amen?

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260
I told Tim this morning,

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.260
we've not had the trumpet for a couple of weeks.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.340
And I said to Tim, I said,

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.060
man, it was good to hear the trumpet this morning.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.900
Amen?

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.720
I enjoy that.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.980
I get to hear it more than all of you

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.340
because I sit right in front of them

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.740
and that thing's pointing right at me,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.580
but I love it.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.400
I play the trumpet.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.480
I don't play it that well.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.020
I quit playing it for a lot of years.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.740
And I said to Tim just a couple of weeks ago,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.200
I better start getting back to it

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.740
because he's gonna be leaving soon

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.720
and we gotta have a trumpet

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.980
because I've gotten used to it.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.880
Somebody else wants to learn how to play the trumpet,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.720
please let me know

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.480
and we'll give you that opportunity.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320
Amen?

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.180
But it says that the trumpeters sounded

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.640
and all this continued notice

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.580
until the burnt offering was finished.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.060
And when they had made an end of offering,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.540
listen, you know when we give an offering to the Lord,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.060
we're worshiping God.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.020
The time of our service,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.660
when we have our time of passing and offering play,

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.500
understand with me this evening

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.560
that that's part of worship.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.060
It's part of worship.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.740
I know that there's a lot of people

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.260
that send a lot of criticisms to church

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.460
and to Christians that they just want our money.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.980
Has nothing to do with that.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.420
It's a matter of worship

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.100
and it's a matter of obedience is what it is.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.540
And what a blessing to be able to worship the Lord,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.240
to give back to him a portion of what he's blessed us with.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.520
The time of offering,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.580
and I hope you can understand this,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.580
I've sat in services over the years,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.260
it really has always bothered me.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.620
We've not had it much here because of,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.500
well, I'm the pastor,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.740
and so therefore I don't behave this way

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.620
and I don't really invite guest speakers to come

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.780
that would behave this way.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.000
But I remember seeing for years

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.020
while I was in Bible college

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.420
and serving in other ministries,

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.220
where guest speakers would come in

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.360
and during the entire song service and offering,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.540
they'd just be sitting there talking.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.820
It just drives me crazy.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.860
Because then you're gonna get up and preach

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.500
or they'd be working on their sermon.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.060
Listen, man, you had yesterday to work on your sermon.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.580
And last week, and most of the evangelists,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.780
if anyone's gonna watch it tonight,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.820
they preach the same sermon over and over, amen?

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.660
I'm just teasing, just teasing.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.500
But the reality is that it's not a time for talking.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.260
It's not a time for, no, no, it's worship.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.340
It's worship.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.460
I don't wanna miss the singing.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.020
I enjoy the singing, why?

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.780
Because the singing prepares my heart.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.420
It's an act of worship, but it's also preparatory.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.000
And we find that as we look here in the offering time,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.720
what a blessing to be able to give back to God.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.400
It says, the king and all that were present with him

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.760
bowed themselves and worshiped.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.520
Verse 30, moreover, Hezekiah the king and the princes

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.600
commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.160
with the words of David and of Asaph the seer.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.560
And they sang praises with gladness

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.920
and they bowed their heads and worshiped.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.920
I believe that it was done decently and in order.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.200
In fact, we understand that the New Testament tells us

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.240
that our God is a God of order.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.840
He is not the author of confusion.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.760
He's a God of order.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.440
And we're to worship Him orderly, decently in an order.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.800
We find that here in 2 Chronicles,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.320
there's a great revival during Hezekiah's time.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.600
And we see how they're worshiping the Lord.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.120
He's worthy of our worship.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.740
I want you to notice over in Malachi, if you will,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.200
and we're gonna get our way over to the New Testament

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.040
here in just a moment.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.920
But look at Malachi with me just for a moment.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.600
Malachi chapter one.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.960
Notice what the Bible says in Malachi chapter one.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.420
In verse number six.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.720
Malachi chapter one, verse number six.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.920
Last book of the Old Testament

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.720
just before the Gospel of Matthew.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.800
Malachi chapter number one, verse number six.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.680
A son honoreth his father and a servant his master.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.880
If then I be a father, where is mine honor?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.140
If I be a master, where is my fear?

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.560
Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.480
O priest that despise my name.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.780
And you say, wherein have we despised thy name?

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.620
Notice what he says,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.580
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.480
And ye say, wherein have we polluted thee?

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.040
In that you say, the table of the Lord is contemptible.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.000
Notice in verse eight,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.520
if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.680
And if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.880
So there was prescribed,

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.080
in the book of Leviticus, there's a prescribed order

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.520
of what type of animals to be brought for a sacrifice.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.240
And here what's happening is saying,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.120
listen, are you gonna bring a blind or a lame?

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.620
What would be the significance?

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.620
Well, that one is not of any profit or benefit to me,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.300
so I'm just gonna offer that to the Lord.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.940
No, no, we're to take our best to the Lord, amen.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.140
Notice what he says in verse number eight.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.700
He says, offer it now unto thy governor.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.300
Will he be pleased with thee?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.860
Or accept thy person, sayeth the Lord of hosts.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.180
I mean, that's convicting.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.480
He's saying, you're trying to bring me these offerings

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.100
and saying that you're worshiping,

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.580
but you're not bringing them the way

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.780
that you're supposed to.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.980
You don't bring me a blind or a lame.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.220
Offer it to your governor, are they gonna accept it?

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.900
The answer is obvious, no.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.440
By the way, most of them wouldn't have brought that

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.380
to the governor.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.380
It would be shameful to do such things.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.900
But yet they'd bring it to God.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.720
I'm thankful as you look through

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.220
and understand in verse 14, notice what God says.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.780
We've skipped some verses here, but it says this.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.580
Well, let me read verse 11.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.920
For from the rising of the sun,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.900
even under the going down of the same,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.320
that my name shall be great among the Gentiles.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.660
And every place in sin shall be offering to my name

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.900
and a pure offering.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.780
For my name shall be great among the heathen,

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.740
sayeth the Lord of hosts.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.020
In verse 14, see they had profaned it.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.420
Verse 14, though, notice it says,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.980
but cursed be the deceiver,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.500
which hath in his flock a male,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.100
and voweth and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.620
Notice where he says, for I am a great king,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820
sayeth the Lord of hosts,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.260
and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.900
He's worthy of our best.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.580
He really is.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.020
And we find that the book of Revelation

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.660
gives us a glimpse into worship in heaven.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.160
One day we're gonna get to heaven.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.060
I don't know when it's gonna be,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.140
but one day we're gonna get to heaven.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.480
Revelation chapter four and five,

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.580
give us a little taste, if you will,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.700
a little view into the throne room of heaven.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.460
We find in Revelation four and five,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.120
there's gonna be a lot of worship going on.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.860
And I know, I think it was Brother Meshon,

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.100
he said it maybe one of the last times he was here,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.780
he said that we ought to prepare for it now

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.660
because we're gonna worship God forever,

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.980
and so we ought to get used to it now.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.220
And again, worship isn't running around,

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.060
loud music, dark lights, smoke, all this kind of nonsense.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.980
I talked about some stuff on Wednesday evening

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.340
that they did in a number of churches around America

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.160
on Super Bowl Sunday.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.140
It's absolutely blasphemous what they were doing.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.780
Kicking Bibles around the stage.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.660
Are you kidding me?

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.780
Literally said, as they opened up a service,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.060
and by the way, the preachers came out through a tunnel

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.140
with smoke coming up like they were some kind of celebrity.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.540
What in the world?

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.980
Blasphemous.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.060
There was a man dressed as a referee,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.500
and here's the thing that was amazing,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.340
they're all dressed, not their best,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.180
but you know what was happening?

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.580
The commentators, quote unquote,

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.020
they're in suits and ties.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.900
Isn't that interesting?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.300
They're in suits and ties,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.700
and then these folks come out,

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.020
and they say to the pastor,

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.220
they're gonna do a coin flip,

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.620
and they say this, quote,

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:32.300
do you want to kick or receive the Bible?

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.700
I can't even imagine saying those words.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.740
I'm simply quoting them.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.060
The pastor said, I'll receive it,

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.820
and they literally set up like a kickoff on the platform

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.140
and kick the Bible across the stage.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.020
Unbelievable.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.060
That's not worship.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.420
That is not worship.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.780
Our God is to be worshiped.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.740
Listen, it's not about the size of a crowd.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.420
The people in those auditoriums were going crazy.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.340
Looked just like the people in the stadiums,

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.500
to be honest with you.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.900
You know what those people were worshiping?

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.100
Not the creator God,

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.540
they were worshiping an idol.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:22.900
Right?

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.300
In the stadiums, they're worshiping an idol.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.180
That's what they're doing.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.140
Bring that stuff into the house of God.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.860
Crazy.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.540
The house of God is the pillar and ground of truth.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.180
Amen?

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.740
If I ever say we're gonna have a Super Bowl thing,

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.500
just fire me.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.900
I mean, seriously.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.580
The reality is that when we approach a holy God,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.580
we approach him on his terms,

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.580
and we approach him his way.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.100
He is a thrice holy God.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.460
He is to be reverenced.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.140
He's to be honored and to be glorified.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.460
He's to be worshiped.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.780
I don't know if you've ever heard somebody say, when I see God, you're not going to do

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:14.300
anything but fall on your face.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.340
I want to know who...no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.060
Change your thinking.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.400
You're going to simply fall on His face, in His presence, and He's worthy.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.780
Revelation 4, notice in verse number 10, the 4 and 20 elders represented of the church

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:35.060
fall down before Him that sat on the throne and worship Him that liveth forever and ever.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:40.740
And cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.260
and honor and power, for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.540
and were created.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.020
Chapter 5, and I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book written

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.980
within and on the back side, sealed with seven seals.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:02.140
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.900
and to loose the seals thereof?

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.900
And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.340
neither to look thereon.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.340
And I wept much.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.340
Why?

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.900
Because no man was found worthy to open and read the book, neither to look thereon.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.660
And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:25.640
Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.700
book and to loose the seven seals thereof.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.660
And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and on the four beasts, in the midst

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:39.460
of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes,

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.860
which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.860
And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.380
And when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.400
before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors, which

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.260
are the prayers of saints.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:06.420
Notice verse 9, and they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:12.280
to open the seals thereof, for Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:19.780
of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.120
and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.160
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.780
and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:40.960
of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.680
and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.700
And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:56.100
are as in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:02.060
and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.020
And the four beasts said, Amen.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:12.280
The four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped Him that liveth forever and ever.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.480
Fourteen verses in chapter five, but man, what a scene.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480
We're going to be there.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480
Hallelujah.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.920
Listen, we're going to worship Him.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:29.040
But you don't have to wait until then to worship God.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:37.220
Worship in a, if you just read Genesis 48, it just seems like a meeting between a father

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.400
and a son and a couple of grandsons.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.440
And yes, he's talking about what God has done and the past and what He's doing in the present,

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:54.380
what He's going to do in the future, but Hebrew says that He worshipped this evening.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.280
We need to worship our God.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.680
He is worthy of worship.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.240
He alone is to be worshipped.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.620
Our children and our children's children, a generation that would rise after us need

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.940
to see that we're worshipping God.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.740
We worship Him because of what He's done.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.160
You know, He's done some amazing things, He really has.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.480
We worship Him because of what He's doing.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.520
I know that it's a dark hour that we live in, but God's still working.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.500
God's still on His throne.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.380
People are still getting saved.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.020
God's still at work.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.940
We need to worship Him for what He's doing and then, oh, we can worship Him knowing what

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.840
He's going to do because one day He's coming back for us.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.060
One day we're going to see Him face to face, we were singing about a little bit this evening,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.860
when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.700
But you know, we can have a little bit of that here on earth.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.260
We can worship Him.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.660
He's worthy of our worship.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.940
This week, we come together for corporate worship, Sunday morning, Sunday evening, we

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.540
worship the Lord, the prayer and Bible study, worshipping the Lord on Wednesday.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.220
But you know, you need to worship God every day in your life.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.940
Worship God.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.940
Worship Him.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.180
He's worthy.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.820
You don't have to necessarily come to a corporate meeting place to worship God.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.020
You can worship God in your individual life.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:28.980
It's a great thing to come together corporately and collectively worship God.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.980
Singing with you is so much better than singing by myself.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:33.980
It really is.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:39.980
It's just a sweet thing when you hear the saints of God singing out the great hymns

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980
of faith.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.980
Man, it's encouraging.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.860
You come to a place like this and you hear the singing, man, it encourages you.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.860
Why?

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.780
Because we're worshipping God and He's worthy of our worship.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.620
The Bible says that Jacob, he worshipped.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.220
This evening, I hope that we'd be challenged.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:02.420
Yes, we see the historical context and it's a blessing to see that God recorded that for

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.580
us.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.580
But tonight, how's our worship?

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.460
How are we doing worshipping the Lord?

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460
Let's pray together.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.460
Father, we love you.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.540
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.300
Thank you for the Bible.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:19.660
Thank you for what you have done in our lives individually, families that are gathered here

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:26.020
this evening, what you've done in their lives, as a church, what you've done in our history.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.540
Thank you for what you're doing today, how you're working.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:33.580
Thank you for adding to the church today, having someone join this morning.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.620
God, we're thankful.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.940
We've had baptism this year.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.580
We've had salvation this year.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.460
Lord, we just thank you for what you're doing and how you're working and we give you all

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.860
the honor and all the glory for it's due unto your name.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.580
You are worthy.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.300
God we thank you for what you will do.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.140
We know that you have a plan.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:58.380
You've revealed much of your plan to us, though we don't know the timing for several things,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:05.660
we know you have a plan and God we look forward to one day being in your presence, worshipping

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.660
you.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:13.660
We read that text of scripture in Revelation 4 and 5 and how our heart longs to be in your

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.940
presence, to worship you, to see you face to face.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.660
God I pray that until that time you would help us to worship you in spirit and in truth

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:30.820
here in our lives with the days that you give us, to worship you in our own personal daily

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.780
lives, to worship you corporately and collectively.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:39.500
Lord, there'd be a generation that would come behind us that would see that our God is real

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:45.300
and that he is worthy of worship and that he is the one that determines how we approach

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300
him.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.300
I pray God that you'd move and work as only you can and we'll give you the honor and glory

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.300
for it.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.700
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.700
Would you stand with me?

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.700
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.820
We have a brief moment of invitation this evening.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.620
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
