00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
I got saved in 1975, back in Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.099
That's where I was raised.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.220
My folks were from Kentucky,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.180
but we moved to Cincinnati for work.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.180
And I got saved in a church called Landmark Baptist Temple.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.420
My pastor was a man named John Rawlings.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.420
And on Sunday morning, that church would run about 6,000.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.059
Sunday night, you'd go back and probably 3,500

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.380
on a Sunday night, it was way down, kidding.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.939
But they had a choir of about 200,

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.680
and it was, I'm telling you, it was just outstanding.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.860
And I know that's a different era,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.139
and I'm not suggesting now, but back in 1975,

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:47.779
things were done a little bit differently.

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:50.680
And Dr. Rawlings had a favorite song,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.020
and his favorite song was,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.939
"'Til the Storm Passes By."

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.319
And his son, Herb, would sing,

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.279
and the choir would sing it behind him.

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:02.720
And at Landmark, if Doc wanted to hear it again,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.599
he would just say, sing it again.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.879
And it didn't matter if the service

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:09.480
went an extra hour or what,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.400
we were gonna sing it again.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.959
One time, there was where we heard,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.160
"'Til the Storm Passes By,"

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
I think it was five, maybe six times.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.000
I knew all the words by the time it was over.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.919
But as I was sitting there this evening, Brianna,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:26.720
I'd have just said, again, on that offertory.

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:29.040
That was just outstanding and beautiful.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.720
All the music, all week.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.400
I hope, I'm talking as an old man

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.000
and as a friend to you now,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.599
I hope you appreciate what you have.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.239
Not everybody has a church like this.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.980
And not everybody has music and just people

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.720
that are willing to give of themselves

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.279
and give of their time.

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.519
It is a blessing.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.519
And I say that so that you're very careful

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.440
to do two things.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440
Number one, protect it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.480
Number two, participate in it and be part of it,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.120
because it is a wonderful, wonderful group of people.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.199
Brother and Mrs. Mann, thank you for being so gracious.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.479
I have not told them yet,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.520
but I'm moving into their basement.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.679
Man, I have been so comfortable over there

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:20.679
and I've gotten work done and just enjoyed it thoroughly.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.679
I am an apple connoisseur.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.440
I eat at least one apple every day.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.919
You don't need to know that,

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.240
but I thought you'd like to know that.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.720
And I have a very favorite apple.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.600
My favorite apple is ambrosia apples.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.199
And last year I mentioned that to Pastor Mann.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.080
And when I got here on Saturday,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.199
you know what was in the prophet's chamber?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.240
Ambrosia apples.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.279
That's just kindness, you know?

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.479
That's just thoughtfulness to remember that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.080
and do that.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.559
And I know where he gets it.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.039
He gets it from Mrs. Mann.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.119
It does not come naturally to pastor.

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.000
It's handed down by Mrs. Mann,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.279
but I appreciate the spirit of the Mann household.

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.000
It is a blessing to be there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I really am grateful.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.320
And I know I speak for these missionaries.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.080
You've been so kind to us.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.039
And you know, that's meaningful.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:25.199
We're just people that are gonna be here for a few days,

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.479
but you mark our lives.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.199
Sometimes we think it's all about us

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.520
coming in and preaching to people,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.119
but honestly, we get our lives marked.

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.360
We get our lives impacted.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.479
And this has just been such a positive

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.679
several days to be part of here.

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.960
So thank you for all that you do and who you are

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.000
and what God is doing in this place.

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.199
You're really a blessing to people that come through.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.039
Thanks.

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.520
You encouraged us.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.679
All right, that's the nice stuff.

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:55.600
Let's get to preaching.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.279
Amen.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.160
I wanna do something a little unusual tonight.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.080
I want you to start in Matthew chapter nine,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.559
starting in Matthew chapter nine.

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.679
We're just gonna look at that for a moment

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.759
and we're gonna do another sword drill.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.520
And where I'm going to get eventually

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.559
is I wanna preach to you on this thought.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.600
God's promises to those who will go.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.559
I can't call anybody to the field.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.959
Boy, I think we need to be really careful about that.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:33.959
But what we can try to do is just demonstrate the need

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.040
and then help folks to understand

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.040
that when God does call us and when we do surrender to go,

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.239
God makes promises to those people

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.920
who will surrender their lives, surrender their resources

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.959
and simply obey him and what he's called them to do.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:59.799
I want you to notice in chapter nine, Matthew chapter nine,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.279
and let's just look at verse 35.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.679
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:10.640
teaching in their synagogues

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.399
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.799
and healing every sickness

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:19.119
and every disease among the people.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.079
But when he saw the multitudes,

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:25.320
he was moved with compassion on them

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.739
because they fainted and were scattered abroad

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.119
as sheep having no shepherd.

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.200
I don't have time to preach this passage,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.160
but when I look at our culture,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.119
can I be honest with you?

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:42.420
Sometimes I'm angry with them,

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.059
but that's not the right response.

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.899
Our response ought to be brokenhearted for them.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:54.899
And when Jesus looked on these people in these great crowds,

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:57.500
man, they were sinners.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.940
They were pagans.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.079
They were idol worshipers.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:02.540
They were legalists.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.299
They were just as sinful as our generation,

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.540
maybe in just some other ways.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.160
And yet he wasn't angry with them.

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:14.119
He was moved for them.

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.640
Moved with compassion

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.679
because he saw how desperate the need is.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.920
And I want you to notice then in verse 37.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.859
And then saith he unto his disciples,

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:29.420
the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.059
but the laborers are few.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:36.160
Sometimes when we look at our culture,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.559
I'm just speaking for myself,

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:40.239
sometimes we can have the attitude,

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.040
man, those are throwaway people.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.040
Look at how their life is.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.079
Look at how they're conducting themselves.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:48.239
Look at how they look.

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.000
Look at their lifestyle.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.480
Look at what they believe.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.820
Man, why can't everybody be like me?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.119
Well, a good dose of the grace of God,

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:00.679
and maybe they can be like me.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.679
And Jesus never looked at that sinful culture

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:08.359
and said, those are throwaway people.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:11.640
Jesus said, will you come help me reach them?

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:17.600
Man, they can be reached if we have laborers.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.200
So what are we supposed to do church?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.959
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.859
that he will send forth the laborers into his harvest.

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:33.600
I wonder, and I'm not being critical tonight.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.519
I'm not trying to be adversarial.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:40.519
I wonder if we truly examined our prayer ledger,

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.679
if we truly took a look at our prayer time,

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:50.679
how many of us would find a line in our intercession

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.720
asking God to call people to the field?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.239
I wonder how many pastors go row by row in their mind

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.480
and pray, would you call that family out of my church?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.160
Yeah, they're good tithers.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.720
Yeah, they're great servants.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.160
Would you please call them out?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.600
I am convinced that a missions conference

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.480
is the one meeting each year

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.640
where we try to get rid of our best people.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:21.760
I wonder how many parents,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.480
as they put those children in that bed each night.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.320
Man, they love their kids.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.119
They're protective of their kids.

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:32.599
And I wonder, and I'm not trying to be super spiritual,

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:36.719
but I wonder how many, as they put those kids in that bed,

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:41.400
say, God, would you please call my son

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.659
to be a laborer in your harvest field?

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:53.700
I'm just saying, why don't we have more laborers?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960
I'm not sure anybody's praying for them.

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:02.000
For 23 years, I've been on the board at BIMI

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.520
these past five years, I've been the treasurer of BIMI.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.239
Can I tell you something?

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:09.760
My knees were shaking through COVID

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.719
because I thought, whoa, what's gonna happen?

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.520
Man, if people don't have jobs

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.159
and if churches can't convene,

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:17.719
what's gonna happen to the giving?

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:19.960
We've got people to take care of.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.159
You know what happened?

00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:23.159
It went up.

00:09:24.239 --> 00:09:26.280
Giving went up.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.280
We had our biggest years, 2020, 21, 22, 23.

00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:35.919
We blew it off the charts in 22,

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:38.520
and are doing so in 23.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.520
You say, that's awesome, preacher.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.520
It is awesome, and I'm glad for it.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.840
I praise God for it.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.719
But can I tell you the rest of the story?

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.760
We're not seeing many people called to the field.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.479
Oh, we got money.

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:57.200
We got programs.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.520
We just lack people.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.640
Where are the people?

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.240
Where are the laborers?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:12.680
And listen, I think there's probably a thousand reasons that we can consider, a dozen things

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.680
that we could be very careful to study.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:23.400
But I would suggest to you that most failures in our lives and in our churches are markedly

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.920
prayer failures.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:36.760
And God says, pray ye therefore, the Lord of the harvest, man, send forth laborers into

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.760
the harvest.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.880
Now I'm not having a prayer meeting tonight, that's not my position.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.520
And I'm not just scolding myself or you, I'm including myself in all the things I just

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.360
said.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.920
I can't call anybody to the field, I could wish that I could and I'm willing to, no,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.000
not really.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.020
But I want you to understand this, this is what I can do.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:13.840
I can tell you that if God is dealing with you, that's a big deal.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.600
And sometimes we're fearful, we live our Christian lives so timidly.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.480
We live our Christian lives in our control.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.000
In other words, up to that spot where, boy, if I take another step I've got to really

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.160
trust God.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.320
And I get it, I've been there and I don't want to present myself as some great paragon

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.600
of faith, I struggle every day to trust the Lord with my life.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.960
Not my soul, that was easy, but with my life.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.360
But I'm telling you, God makes some promises to his people.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:02.240
And I want you to see that if God is speaking to your heart, dealing with your heart, speaking

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.880
to you about your life, that surrendering and answering a call is not something to be

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.920
fearful of.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.640
It is something to step into the promises of God.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.800
And I want to tonight, and I'll be brief, has a preacher ever said that to you?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800
I'll be as brief as I can.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:31.080
I want to expose five promises that God makes to those who will answer the call and go.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.360
Let's go just a little further in Matthew chapter 28.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.840
You've probably never read these verses at a missions conference before.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.720
Matthew chapter 28.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.520
And I want you to notice in verse 19, we'll read these famous verses, we know them.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.080
Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.720
and the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.280
And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.800
Now listen, in the Great Commission, I can understand why God says you're supposed to

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.240
go, and then He's very clear to make disciples, and then He's very clear to baptize those

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.720
disciples, and then He's very clear, teach them to observe all things whatsoever I've

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720
commanded you.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.400
Man, that is the commission.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.960
That is our job.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.680
But I'll be honest with you, it just, you know, kind of gets my attention when He adds

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.520
this thought, I am with you always.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.480
I am with you always.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.200
Why did God add that to the commission?

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.500
Sometimes when we read the Great Commission, we are very careful to read those verses that

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:53.520
we know are attendant with it, but sometimes we're not as careful about the context around

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520
it.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.200
And I would invite your attention back to verse 16.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:05.320
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.080
them.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:15.720
And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, but some doubted.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.720
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.200
earth.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:31.000
The disciples understand that there is an approaching and a growing finality to Jesus

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.280
dealing with them.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.240
He's been talking about going away.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.000
Hey, He did go away on the cross and into the tomb, but thank God He came out of that

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
tomb.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
He rose again.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.240
And listen, when it says that these disciples had been commanded by the Lord, appointed

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.640
to meet on this mountain, on this day, at this time, they have a sense that this is

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.920
a big deal.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.040
This is kind of a final moment.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.680
And so, as they're waiting for Jesus, and Jesus approaches them and is going to share

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:12.400
with them this great commission, He knows that in their heart, some of them are doubtful.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.800
What's that mean?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.240
Does it mean they doubt whether this is really the one who rose again?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240
No.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.280
They've put their fingers in His hands.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.520
They've seen the spear scar on His side.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.960
It says they worshipped Him.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.440
They weren't wondering, is this God?

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.120
They weren't wondering, is this the resurrected Lord?

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.120
Study that word doubted out, and here's what is happening in their heart.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.680
They're wavering.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.760
They're wavering.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.560
What are they wavering for?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.800
Well, because everything in ministry that they have done for three and a half years

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.720
has been in the presence of the Lord Jesus.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.880
Hey, if they moved, if He moved, they moved.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.920
They were with Him when He did great miracles.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.400
They've seen Him heal.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.560
They've seen Him raise dead people.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.840
They've seen Him turn water to wine.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.400
They have seen miracle after miracle.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.640
And as long as He is standing by their side, they're good.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.680
But now He's going.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.120
And can we really do this?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.680
Can we really do what He's asking us to do?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.680
If He's not here?

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.400
I don't know about you.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.960
I sometimes try to appear to be confident, but when God has told me to do something and

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.920
I say, yeah, I'm going to do it, and I turn the light out, I say, why did I say that?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.400
And God makes them a promise.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.720
I will be present with you.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:02.240
I said to you the other evening that one of the greatest forces that discourages and brings

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.080
young missionaries home from the field is a sense of loneliness and isolation.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.320
I'm here by myself.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.640
Does anybody know I'm here?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.760
Does anybody care about what we're doing?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.880
Does anybody care about our struggle?

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.200
Does anybody know we have a crisis?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.280
Does anybody know we have a need?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.960
Does anybody even know we're here?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.520
I haven't experienced it to that level.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.920
But when we started Heritage Baptist Church in 1981, oh man, it was great.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.640
Because for the first three weeks, group after group came from Pittsburgh from our church

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.680
there and helped us.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.320
We knocked doors together.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.980
We were leading people to Christ at the door.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.520
We were announcing time for the prayer meeting and the first service.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.960
It was great.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960
But you know what happened?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.440
They couldn't keep coming from Pittsburgh.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.740
And so more and more my mother and father would come from Kentucky and they would stay

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.760
and watch the kids and Nancy and I would go out soul winning, but mother and dad couldn't

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.040
keep coming.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.920
I'll never forget those days when mother and dad couldn't keep coming and we had three

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.120
children and Nancy had to stay home and care for the children.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.680
And I don't know if you know this, but when you are starting a church and you have no

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.320
congregation, you ain't got a lot to do.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.720
And so you go soul winning.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.840
You say, you said ain't preacher.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.720
It's good preaching, isn't it?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.239
You go soul winning and you go soul winning by yourself.

00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:39.200
Going soul winning by yourself on an August afternoon when it's 184 degrees and the humidity

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.880
is 362 is not an easy thing.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:53.559
I can remember going up to a door and just being so rudely treated by a lady.

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:58.880
I mean, it was just so ugly the way she talked and get off my property and don't bring that

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.679
stuff around here.

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:06.160
And boy, when I'm walking back down to the main sidewalk, I'm thinking to myself, nobody

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.360
knows the trouble.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.760
I mean, I'm feeling sorry for myself.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.880
And I am thinking to myself, what am I doing out here?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.360
These people are not, what am I doing out here?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.160
I'm all by myself.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:28.480
You ever have one of those moments where the Holy Spirit just gets you and he just stops

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.280
you.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.520
And I'm telling you, I don't know if you've ever been to Dale City, but in the middle

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.840
of Dale City on a sidewalk on a, I think it was a Friday afternoon in August.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:49.280
I'm sweating like a pig and I had an epiphany and the Holy Spirit stopped me and he said,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.000
you have not gone to one door by yourself.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.119
You have not written one sermon by yourself.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:59.440
You have not talked to one or.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.800
counsel to anybody by yourself. You are not here by

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.240
yourself. I am present with you every step of this way.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.680
And I say this to you, young man, young woman, young

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.720
couple, I say to you that God does not abandon you when

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.920
you answer His call. God goes with you. And the promise

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.460
that He makes to you is whether it is a sidewalk in

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.060
Glendale City or a dirt path or a jungle in Africa or

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:35.300
Burma, I know exactly where that jungle is, God says. I

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.000
know the way in, I know the way out, I know what I've

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.540
got you there for, I know how to care for you. I will

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.380
be with you. Here's number two. Turn with me quickly to

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:53.820
Mark chapter 16. Not only does He promise us His

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:59.720
presence, He promises us protection. Look at verse 15.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.100
And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.660
preach the gospel to every creature. That's the part of

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.700
the commission we know. He that believeth and is

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.300
baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.600
be damned. And these signs shall follow them that

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.040
believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.639
shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:29.139
serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:32.880
not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.840
shall recover. Now can I tell you something? Right now

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.779
your pastor is nervous. I want to assure you my

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:43.959
theology is correct, my dispensationalism is correct.

00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:48.620
I know what these verses say. There was a time in the New

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.319
Testament when God used signed gifts through the

00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:58.260
apostles. They had signed gifts because the gift would

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.160
confirm that they were speaking for God and that the

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.319
message they were delivering was from the Lord. We don't

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:07.800
need signed gifts anymore because we have the completed

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.600
Word of God. We have it in its totality. Here's the Word.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.380
But what I am suggesting to you is that we serve a

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:24.279
supernatural God. We serve a God who is not bound by

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:29.520
natural law. He is the author of natural law. And by the

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.880
way, there is no mother nature, but there is a Creator

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:39.919
God. And God is able to suspend natural law, transcend

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:45.660
natural law. God is able to protect His people wherever

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.619
they are on God's created earth. Now I'm not saying

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:54.520
difficult and bad things never happen to good people. What

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.360
I am saying is that accidents don't happen to good people

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.339
that are serving the Lord. And if God does allow a

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.839
difficult thing into your life, it is accompanied with

00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:10.479
His great grace. I am saying to you that as I view things

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.600
today, I see more and more people fearful of stepping

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.839
into a call to a mission field. I even observe parents

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:26.320
who are fearful of allowing their children to even

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.160
entertain a call to a mission field. And I would suggest to

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.619
you tonight that your child is safer in a mud hut in the

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:38.760
midst of Africa eating monkey meat than they are in a

00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:42.680
comfortable suburb out of the will of God close to you so

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.820
you can have your grandchildren there. We have got to think

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.320
right on this thing. Listen, the Apostle Paul was a man

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.160
surrendered to the Lord. And I know he was an apostle, and I

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.800
know you can discount it. But I'm just telling you that he

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.940
has been in the water more than any apostle I know. He

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.639
was shipwrecked. And I don't think he went to the YMCA and

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.960
took swim lessons as a teen, alright? I think God protected

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.299
him. I think God brought a piece of wood by at the right

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:19.500
time so that he could hang on to that wood and get to the

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.140
shore. I think when he got to the shore he was cold, and God

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.440
said, start a fire. And he went and got wood. And when he

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.380
brought his hand out from that wood there was a serpent

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.480
attached to his hand. That would have done it for me, I

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:38.360
guarantee you. He shook it off. And God was able to stop

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.380
the venom. I don't know whether God stopped the snake

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.820
from envenomating him, or whether God stopped the venom.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.279
I don't know what God did. God can do what He wants to do

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:53.320
because God is able. One of my favorite missionary

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.260
biographies is a book called, Evidence Not Seen, Darlene

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.899
Diebler-Rose. And Darlene Diebler-Rose and her first

00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:05.899
husband were on Papua New Guinea at the outbreak of World

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:11.279
War II. And they were taken captive by the Japanese. Mr.

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:16.880
Rose, or Mr. Diebler, was put into a separate camp from

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.320
Darlene, and he passed away in that labor camp. Darlene

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.320
survived the war. One of the things that she had secreted

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.299
away was just a little New Testament. It was the most

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:32.140
precious possession she had. And the Japanese were cruel,

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:35.380
hard, hard masters. And they wanted to protect their

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.880
workers. And so as the war went on, as the American

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.619
bombers came over, they weren't always able to discern,

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:46.459
is this an American barracks, or is this a Japanese barracks?

00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:50.299
And so often the labor camp would be bombed

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:53.799
indiscriminately. And the Japanese, not wanting to lose

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:57.339
their laborers, insisted that you leave the barracks and go

00:25:57.339 --> 00:26:00.480
out into the ditch where there was some protection from the

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.720
bombs. And one day the air raid siren sounded, and Ms. Rose

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.119
ran from the barracks and into the ditch, the protected area,

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:13.619
and it dawned on her she forgot her New Testament. And it

00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:16.799
just killed her to think that New Testament might get blown

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:20.299
up, burned up. She got up out of the ditch and ran back in

00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:23.339
knowing she might get beat for it. But she went back into

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:26.380
the barracks and got that New Testament. As she came out of

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.739
the door running back to where she was supposed to be, it was

00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:34.779
nothing but a smoking crater where a bomb had hit. You say,

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:45.119
preacher, what a coincidence. What a God. We don't have to

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:51.220
live fearfully. We can trust God. He goes out of His way to

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.260
say to us, I am able to protect you if I call you to the field.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:08.760
Turn with me quickly, Luke chapter 24. Look at verse 46.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:15.200
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:23.179
I'm not there in the right place am I? 24. All right, now

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:27.179
46 will make better sense. He said, and thus it is written,

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:30.480
and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480
dead the third day. And that repentance and remission of

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.980
sins should be preached in His name among all nations,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.860
beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.820
And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.660
tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.519
with power from on high. That's Luke's version of the Great

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:02.260
Commission. And what Luke says is, listen, I want you to

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:09.600
preach the gospel and I'm going to endue you with power. Right

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.600
away when we hear that word power, our thought kind of goes

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.580
to, you know, great strength, great muscular strength. But

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.299
that's not what God is saying here. Understand this, that

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:32.080
when we get saved, God gifts us. God gives us a gift that

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.820
enables us to serve Him. And you may be sitting in this room

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.159
tonight with the gift that is necessary for God to use you on

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:45.859
the field. All the time I run into people who say things

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.820
like, well I could never do that. Did you know that that's

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:58.059
qualifying you to go to the mission field? God's not really

00:28:58.059 --> 00:29:01.320
all that interested in the ones who are convinced that they're

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.460
the gift of the world and they can do it all. As a matter of

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.940
fact, God has to kind of break them to make them understand

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:15.960
that without Him they can do nothing. God has already put a

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.200
gift in you. How does it work out here? Hey listen, they are

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.599
to tarry in the upper room and they are to tarry there until

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:29.179
God in this sign gift way endues them with that giftedness.

00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:33.080
Remember what the giftedness was? It was the ability to

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.880
speak or to be heard in the language of literally hundreds

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:41.220
of thousands of people, maybe millions in the city of

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.820
Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. Now you do remember

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:50.340
that Peter had gone to linguistic school. And you do

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.280
remember that John, he was a professor of languages at

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.039
Galilee University. No he wasn't. Peter was better at

00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.539
customizing than John.

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:01.499
than that he was at preaching, okay?

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:04.419
You say, preacher, what is your point?

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:07.979
My point is this, that those men

00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:11.739
did not experience the blessing of Pentecost

00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:16.099
because they had been dutifully prepared in their education.

00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:18.939
They enjoyed the blessing of Pentecost

00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:22.659
because God made them able, because God gifted them.

00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:25.179
And what God is saying is this,

00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:28.779
I promise you, if I call you to the field,

00:30:28.819 --> 00:30:32.899
I will have gifted you what is necessary

00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:35.619
to do what I've called you to do.

00:30:38.699 --> 00:30:40.819
Years ago when I was in Bible college,

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:44.839
I may have told this illustration the last time I was here,

00:30:44.839 --> 00:30:45.819
but I'm gonna tell it again,

00:30:45.819 --> 00:30:48.379
because it's good and old men are allowed to repeat.

00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:51.379
I went to homiletics class.

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:53.619
It was my second or third semester.

00:30:54.459 --> 00:30:56.339
And in homiletics class, at the end,

00:30:56.339 --> 00:30:58.179
you learn how to put together sermons

00:30:58.739 --> 00:31:01.899
and outlines, and at the end of that semester,

00:31:01.899 --> 00:31:04.339
each person, there were about 20 of us in the room,

00:31:04.339 --> 00:31:07.299
we were given seven minutes to preach a sermon,

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:10.039
to put together a sermon and preach the sermon.

00:31:10.939 --> 00:31:15.459
I put together a fantastic sermon.

00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:18.499
My sermon, I can still show it to you,

00:31:18.499 --> 00:31:23.299
the 13 qualities of the high priest

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:28.179
found in Jesus in the book of Hebrews in seven minutes.

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:30.739
It was horrible.

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:34.419
I didn't understand what I was talking about.

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:37.699
No one understood what I was talking about.

00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:40.419
And it's one of those times where you just take your seat

00:31:40.419 --> 00:31:43.479
and you say, I have no business here.

00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:46.639
I can't do this.

00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:52.199
My homiletics professor, a day later, found me in the hall.

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:56.639
Mr. Ron Walker put his arm around my shoulder

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:59.119
and he said, he was being humorous,

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:01.919
but he said to me, Mike, there's a lot of ways

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.859
to serve the Lord besides preaching.

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:07.039
That'll encourage your heart.

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:12.919
I remember that afternoon on my way home,

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:15.679
really thinking about just going home and packing up.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:18.919
There's no way I can do this.

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.919
And another Holy Spirit moment where God says,

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:27.539
hey, this is where I needed you to be.

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:31.199
Where you understand it's not about

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:33.399
what you bring to the table.

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:37.379
You just be a surrendered vessel.

00:32:38.419 --> 00:32:42.359
And let me use you in the way that I have designed

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:43.739
and purposed you.

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:48.739
And God will give us what we need.

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:52.499
I sat next to a Texan named Johnny Fall.

00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:56.139
He got his first English test back

00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:59.659
and I don't even think he scored an F.

00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:03.459
I got mine back and I did well.

00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:06.099
He looked over at me and he said,

00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:07.859
you gotta help me through English.

00:33:08.979 --> 00:33:12.199
He owned a construction business and I said,

00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:13.719
man, I need a job.

00:33:13.719 --> 00:33:15.479
You gotta help me get a job.

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:18.439
So the deal was, I'll give you a job.

00:33:18.439 --> 00:33:20.039
I know nothing about construction

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:21.359
and he knew nothing about English,

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:22.679
so we were a perfect pair.

00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:25.999
He got through by the grace of the professor,

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:27.279
I'm sure with a D.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:30.799
Oh, by the way, he was called to be a missionary to Mexico

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:33.759
and he learned fluently the Spanish language

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:35.279
and could preach in it,

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.419
though he couldn't pass English class.

00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:40.599
We'll say, well, that's just unusual.

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:41.639
No, that's God.

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:45.959
And stop doubting what God can do.

00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:49.039
Stop doubting how God can use you

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:53.959
because God has promised to endue you with power,

00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:58.079
a giftedness from on high that will meet the need

00:33:58.079 --> 00:34:01.079
that he calls you to fill.

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:03.639
Turn with me very quickly, would you?

00:34:03.639 --> 00:34:04.999
John chapter 20.

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:07.519
John chapter 20.

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:12.519
Look at verse 19.

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.479
Then the same day at evening,

00:34:17.479 --> 00:34:18.999
being the first day of the week,

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:20.279
when the doors were shut,

00:34:20.279 --> 00:34:23.199
where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.199
came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them,

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.079
peace be unto you.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.439
And when he had so said,

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:34.139
he showed unto them his hands and his side.

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:37.779
Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:40.179
Then said Jesus to them again,

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:44.819
peace be unto you as my father has sent me,

00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:47.619
even so send I you.

00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:49.619
There's the commission.

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:53.879
And the promise that goes with the commission is this,

00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:55.099
you'll have peace.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.139
I said the other night,

00:34:58.139 --> 00:34:59.719
and I'll say it again briefly.

00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:02.899
I sit two times a year

00:35:02.899 --> 00:35:05.459
and I watch these young couples,

00:35:05.459 --> 00:35:09.759
20s, 24, 25, mid 20s.

00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:12.499
And they've got two or three little kids

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:14.619
and maybe she's expecting another one.

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:17.939
And they're going to places that I don't even know

00:35:17.939 --> 00:35:21.419
that I would feel safe to travel to, Florida.

00:35:23.979 --> 00:35:27.419
They're going to places like Mozambique.

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.739
They're going to third world countries

00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:35.299
where I'm just telling you they're dangerous places.

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.879
They don't want the gospel there.

00:35:36.879 --> 00:35:38.339
They don't want us there.

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:42.019
They only view you or those young missionaries

00:35:42.019 --> 00:35:44.139
as maybe a way to get a meal ticket,

00:35:44.139 --> 00:35:45.139
something to steal from.

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:45.979
I don't know.

00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:46.899
I'm not blaming them.

00:35:46.899 --> 00:35:49.699
I'm just saying that's the condition of our world.

00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:52.499
And I look at those young couples

00:35:52.499 --> 00:35:54.339
and those young children

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:56.679
and the grandpa takes over in me.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:59.439
And I say, man, I don't want you to go.

00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:04.459
But you know what the Lord says?

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:11.099
There's something called a peace that passes understanding.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:17.299
And sometimes we lead our lives so timidly

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:20.459
that we never get to the place where we say,

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:22.699
I don't understand how I'm doing this.

00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:25.739
But God has done something.

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:29.179
God has worked on my behalf.

00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:33.339
I think of some young mother in Uganda

00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:37.379
or in the backwoods of Pakistan

00:36:37.379 --> 00:36:40.939
or Afghanistan or some other place.

00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:43.059
And she wakes up at night

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:46.259
and that child has 102 fever.

00:36:46.259 --> 00:36:49.179
And I would say to them, we'll call urgent care.

00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:51.219
There is no urgent care.

00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:53.799
Well, then take them to the hospital.

00:36:53.799 --> 00:36:55.599
There is no hospital.

00:36:57.539 --> 00:36:58.939
Well, then get your husband.

00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:00.539
Oh, he's out in the bush.

00:37:00.539 --> 00:37:01.419
I'm here by myself.

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.619
What does she do?

00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:03.739
She's got to panic.

00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:04.979
Oh, she's going to panic.

00:37:04.979 --> 00:37:08.099
No, God promised peace.

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:12.499
And in a way above our understanding,

00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:15.059
beyond our thoughts and our capability,

00:37:15.059 --> 00:37:17.579
that woman will have a testimony.

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:21.579
God spoke to me and did something in my heart.

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:25.579
I had a peace that it passed understanding.

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:26.459
Amen.

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:30.299
Where are the hearts that want to live that?

00:37:30.299 --> 00:37:31.379
Yeah, that's right.

00:37:32.779 --> 00:37:34.019
Where are the people?

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:37.859
Where are the believers that will step up and say,

00:37:39.139 --> 00:37:41.139
I'm willing to experience that?

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.259
Because God promises that.

00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:50.139
A peace that passes understanding

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:53.059
in the very midst of the worst storm

00:37:54.019 --> 00:37:55.739
that we can possibly think.

00:37:57.339 --> 00:38:00.179
Last, would you look with me at Acts 1 and verse 8?

00:38:06.419 --> 00:38:07.939
Acts 1 and verse 8,

00:38:07.939 --> 00:38:12.339
but ye shall receive power.

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:14.899
Oh, there's that word again.

00:38:14.899 --> 00:38:16.459
We already talked about power.

00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:17.399
Oh, wait a minute.

00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:19.219
Ye shall receive power

00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:21.939
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you

00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:26.059
and ye shall be my witnesses unto me,

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:31.059
both at the same time in Jerusalem.

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:33.940
Hey, if you're an apostle,

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.899
what a great thing to hear.

00:38:36.899 --> 00:38:39.779
I'm gonna witness about Jesus in Jerusalem

00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:42.419
where they just crucified him.

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:45.820
Where they hated him.

00:38:46.979 --> 00:38:50.859
Where they tried day after day to ensnare him.

00:38:50.899 --> 00:38:52.859
They couldn't stand him.

00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:55.739
And you want me to go in Jerusalem

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:58.899
and think if they did that to Jesus,

00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:00.339
what are they gonna do to me?

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:06.699
You know what that word power means?

00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.699
It has the thought of this.

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:12.599
You will have influence.

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:18.099
How does a Jew who has been with Jesus

00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:20.539
and he's a disciple, an apostle,

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:22.579
how does he go into Jerusalem

00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:25.339
and preach the gospel to the Pharisees?

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:29.019
Because the Holy Spirit empowers his word.

00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:32.139
How does he go into Judea?

00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:32.979
How about this?

00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:34.899
How does he go up to Samaria?

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.899
The Samaritans hate him and they hate them.

00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:44.259
And I'm supposed to walk into Samaria

00:39:44.259 --> 00:39:45.619
and preach the gospel

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:48.579
and they're gonna listen to me, a converted Jew?

00:39:48.579 --> 00:39:51.539
Yeah, because it's not about you.

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:53.579
It's about the Spirit of God

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:56.859
empowering the message of the gospel.

00:39:58.259 --> 00:39:59.099
You say, well.

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:01.219
I'm just kind of a backward guy.

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:03.259
I'm just kind of a quiet girl.

00:40:03.259 --> 00:40:05.699
I don't have a forceful personality.

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:08.099
No, you've got the Holy Spirit for that.

00:40:09.659 --> 00:40:12.739
And the Spirit of God says, listen,

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:16.099
there's power coming from me, not from you.

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:19.939
As a matter of fact, you need to get out of the way.

00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:26.279
So that the power of the Spirit of God can work through us.

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.119
You say, preacher, what's your point?

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:29.959
And I'm done.

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:34.939
My point is that everybody in this room is qualified to go.

00:40:36.839 --> 00:40:38.659
Because it isn't about us.

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:42.919
Oh, I just don't have any great ability.

00:40:42.919 --> 00:40:45.079
Well, you might have the greatest ability

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:46.639
of all, availability.

00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:52.679
And you're willing to come and say, Lord, here's my life.

00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:54.039
Amen.

00:40:55.319 --> 00:41:00.319
Will you take my life and do what only you can do

00:41:01.999 --> 00:41:02.839
through me?

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:05.159
And God, I'm willing to go.

00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:06.519
I don't want to go by myself.

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:09.019
And God says, no, no, no, I'm going with you.

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:12.119
I promised you my presence.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.039
And Lord, I'm a daddy and I've got these little children

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.919
and I've got this precious wife.

00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:18.279
And Lord, I'm a little bit afraid.

00:41:18.279 --> 00:41:19.799
No, no, no, no, no.

00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:21.879
I'm supernatural.

00:41:21.919 --> 00:41:23.119
I can take care of you.

00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:27.199
Oh, but you just don't understand.

00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:28.979
I didn't get good grades.

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:31.559
I can't read very good.

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:32.519
Oh, you don't understand.

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:34.599
I wasn't raised in a Christian home.

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:36.359
I don't know all the Bible stories.

00:41:36.359 --> 00:41:39.679
Hey, hey, you sound like Moses.

00:41:40.719 --> 00:41:45.719
Stop making excuses and trust the God who made you

00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:50.519
the way he made you because he wants to use you.

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:53.359
He can make you able.

00:41:54.959 --> 00:41:56.079
You say, oh, preacher,

00:41:58.279 --> 00:42:00.599
I just can't anticipate all the things

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:01.679
that could be difficult.

00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:04.959
No, you can't, nor will you ever, not even here.

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:08.279
But God does.

00:42:08.279 --> 00:42:09.259
God knows.

00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:11.879
And God already has a plan

00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:16.139
and God will whisper in your ear, peace, peace.

00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:16.979
I got this.

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:21.119
You say, oh, preacher, I'm not like you.

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.979
I'm not a big athletic guy.

00:42:24.799 --> 00:42:26.159
You hurt me when you laugh.

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:29.919
I'm not a force like you are.

00:42:29.919 --> 00:42:30.979
Come on.

00:42:33.879 --> 00:42:35.279
God will give you influence.

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:41.599
Not by power or might, but by his spirit.

00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:46.219
God is just looking for someone.

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:49.519
I'll go.

00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:51.559
I'm yours.

00:42:52.879 --> 00:42:56.039
I will trust you with my life

00:42:57.399 --> 00:43:02.399
and I will take you up on all those promises you made.

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:04.399
Would you pray with me?

00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:07.579
Father, help us to see truth tonight.

00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:11.039
We're so grateful for your word.

00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:17.039
Lord, I'm not trying to, from the power of persuasion,

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:19.239
persuade somebody to go.

00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:22.259
Here's my invitation tonight.

00:43:24.279 --> 00:43:25.599
We curse the darkness.

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:27.239
We bemoan our culture.

00:43:27.239 --> 00:43:30.959
We just think the world is in terrible shape.

00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:35.399
And I would say maybe two or three or four or five

00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:37.639
have prayed this week for laborers.

00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:41.679
It's not that we're bad people.

00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:43.059
It's not that we don't want laborers.

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:44.919
We just forget.

00:43:44.919 --> 00:43:46.739
We just think there must be some other way.

00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:49.339
There must be a program to produce laborers.

00:43:49.339 --> 00:43:51.299
There must be some paycheck we could...

00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:52.919
No.

00:43:52.919 --> 00:43:54.619
Laborers come through prayer.

00:43:56.579 --> 00:44:00.279
Instead of building kingdoms and living fearfully,

00:44:00.279 --> 00:44:02.539
let's pray that the people of our church

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:03.739
are called to the field.

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:06.919
Let's pray that our children are called to the field.

00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:09.999
Let's be so bold as to get to an altar and say,

00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:12.019
Lord, I don't know if you are calling me,

00:44:12.019 --> 00:44:13.939
but if you do, I'll go.

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:16.859
That's praying for laborers.

00:44:19.539 --> 00:44:21.699
There ought to be a commitment from this church.

00:44:21.699 --> 00:44:26.699
Every member of this church, whether they're 90 or nine,

00:44:28.299 --> 00:44:31.139
there ought to be a commitment to begin for God

00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:33.819
to pray and ask God.

00:44:33.819 --> 00:44:37.459
Call people from our church.

00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:40.899
Call people from our family.

00:44:40.899 --> 00:44:43.979
Make them understand your call.

00:44:45.339 --> 00:44:48.659
God, bring laborers from us.

00:44:51.339 --> 00:44:53.639
And the second part of the invitation is this.

00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:57.179
Why don't you offer yourself?

00:44:59.499 --> 00:45:01.759
I didn't say you have to make a decision

00:45:01.759 --> 00:45:05.339
to go to the field, but do you think God might be pleased

00:45:05.339 --> 00:45:09.139
if you just simply said, here am I, Lord, send me?

00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:11.979
It's a mighty pretty song.

00:45:11.979 --> 00:45:13.859
We sing it every missions conference.

00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:16.839
I wonder how many times it's honestly prayed.

00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:23.739
Here am I, Lord, if you want me, I'm offering myself.

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:28.239
Now, God, help us to be serious minded.

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:33.139
Our world desperately needs the gospel.

00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:35.039
They're hurting.

00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:40.159
Jesus said, man, we need laborers.

00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:41.799
How do you get them, Jesus?

00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:45.359
Pray, pray, pray.

00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:48.599
God, help us tonight.

00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:53.579
I ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
