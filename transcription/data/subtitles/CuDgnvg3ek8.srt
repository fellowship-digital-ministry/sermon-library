1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,159
42, and I am thankful for the blessings of the Lord.

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,800
Had a number of folks that were traveling

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,739
that God has brought back safely.

4
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:09,239
Have some folks that continue to travel.

5
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,439
Want you to pray for them.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,880
And then Brother Fernando,

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,600
his grandmother had surgery last evening

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,280
and he sent me a text.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,719
I mentioned this in Sunday School

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,280
and he sent me a text and we prayed

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,079
and we're thankful that that surgery went well

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,680
and she's recovering well

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,559
and so we praise the Lord for that.

14
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,959
And it's amazing our God does here

15
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,319
and answer prayer, amen.

16
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:34,159
And every time we go to the Lord in prayer,

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,279
we have that confidence knowing that he hears us

18
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:39,279
and that he's able and we certainly are encouraged

19
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,880
each time he answers prayer.

20
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,159
Genesis chapter 42 this evening

21
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,240
and we'll look at the entire chapter.

22
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,000
Genesis 42, one through 38.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,959
I'm not gonna read the entire text this evening.

24
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm gonna just kind of jump through the text

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,759
of scripture this evening

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,619
as we deal with this subject matter.

27
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:58,840
But notice beginning in verse number one in Genesis 42,

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,680
the Bible says,

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,680
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt,

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
Jacob said unto his sons,

31
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,400
why do you look one upon another?

32
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,239
And he said, behold,

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,199
I have heard that there's corn in Egypt.

34
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,599
Get you down thither and buy for us from fence

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,319
that we may live and not die.

36
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,360
And Joseph's 10 brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,080
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother,

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,559
Jacob sent not with his brethren

39
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:28,599
for he said, lest peradventure mischief

40
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,120
befall him.

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,919
The sons of Israel came to buy corn

42
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,480
among those that came for the famine

43
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,120
was in the land of Canaan.

44
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,959
We'll dig in further through the text

45
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,959
as we study through this portion of scripture this evening.

46
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,440
But you understand that the seven years of great plenty

47
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,800
had ended and the seven years of dearth began

48
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,959
according to the end of chapter number 41

49
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,319
of the book of Genesis.

50
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,400
We find that Joseph was diligent

51
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,839
during those seven years of great plenty.

52
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,360
And we find that because of his diligence

53
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,599
and his obedience to follow that

54
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,919
which God had revealed to him,

55
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:06,680
we find that there was food in Egypt.

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,679
Now we understand that as we look at this

57
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,360
and dig into chapter number 42,

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,479
it says now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt.

59
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,080
And so we find that as we back up just a little bit

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,639
into chapter 41, by way of introduction,

61
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,520
we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 54,

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,279
notice of chapter 41, verse 54.

63
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,759
And the seven years of dearth began to come

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,119
according as Joseph had said,

65
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:33,839
and the dearth was in all lands.

66
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,080
But in the land of Egypt, there was bread.

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Again, you see in verse number 57,

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,039
notice it says in all countries

69
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,000
came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,839
Why?

71
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:49,300
Because the famine was so sore in all lands.

72
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,800
We find that there in chapter number 42

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,199
in verse number five, at the end of the verse,

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,039
it says that the famine was in the land of Canaan as well.

75
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,119
And so we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

76
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:04,199
I've titled the message this evening,

77
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,360
Joseph's brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
And you see that in verse number three,

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,279
and we find that throughout this passage of scripture

80
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:16,580
that God records for us this journey

81
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,800
that these 10 brothers took from Canaan to Egypt

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,360
for the purpose of getting food, of buying corn.

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,160
And we find that as God would rehearse for us

84
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,600
the account as it takes place,

85
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,639
that these 10 brothers, of course,

86
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,279
they meet their brother, Joseph.

87
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:37,880
Their brother who they had sold into slavery,

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,520
their brother that nearly 20 years had passed

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,679
since the last time they had seen him.

90
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,419
And we find that Joseph now

91
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,279
is in this elevated position of leadership.

92
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,160
We've studied through the book of Genesis.

93
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
We've understood the things that have taken place.

94
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,919
And we find that now these brothers,

95
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,300
because of what Jacob understood to be true,

96
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,559
in verse number one of chapter 42,

97
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,479
the Bible says that Jacob saw

98
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,960
that there was corn in Egypt.

99
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,960
In chapter 42 in verse number two,

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,679
it says that Jacob heard there was corn in Egypt.

101
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,720
And so Jacob, upon understanding

102
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,339
the fact that there was a source of food

103
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,880
and understanding the circumstances

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,799
in which they were facing,

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,559
it was a real bad time

106
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,320
because of this great dearth

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,480
that had came upon the land.

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,200
And notice at the end of verse number two,

109
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,679
he says that we may live and not die.

110
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,420
That gives us some insight

111
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,239
with regard to the conditions

112
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,279
and how bad it really was.

113
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,880
And so we find that Jacob,

114
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
understanding all of these things

115
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,239
and what he was experiencing,

116
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,239
we find that he sends his boys,

117
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:47,600
these 10 sons, to Egypt.

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,559
He did not send Benjamin, the youngest.

119
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,399
Why?

120
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,239
Well, because he'd already lost Joseph

121
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,899
and he did not want any mischief

122
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,760
to fall upon Benjamin.

123
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
In his mind, remember,

124
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,959
Jacob had every part of his being

125
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,799
believe that Joseph was killed.

126
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,320
When his brothers came back

127
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
and they said, hey, we found this.

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,420
Do you know whose this is?

129
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,619
What was it that they showed him?

130
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,140
The coat of many colors

131
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,440
that Jacob had given to his son

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,359
and they had dipped it in blood.

133
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,480
Remember, they killed an animal,

134
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
they dipped it in blood

135
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,119
and they said, we found this.

136
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,519
And what did Jacob believe?

137
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,040
A wild beast hath devoured him.

138
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,000
He believed that he was dead.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,760
And the brothers, his sons,

140
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,799
his own sons allowed him to believe that lie.

141
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,760
And now we find that we come to chapter 42.

142
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,260
So many, I mean, 20 years,

143
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,519
at least a minimum of 20 years has passed

144
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,839
between the time in which Jacob,

145
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,399
his sons sold Joseph into slavery.

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,519
And now as they're dealing with this great famine,

147
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,839
and we find that as we read through Genesis chapter 42,

148
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,600
that as we look at the dialogue

149
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,640
that God provides of this record and this account

150
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,320
and all the interactions that take place,

151
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,320
really what we find is that God is at work.

152
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,279
God is working.

153
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,480
In fact, as we look at this portion of scripture

154
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,239
and we look at the circumstances

155
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,320
that are recorded here in Genesis 42,

156
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,320
it really reminds us that God is always at work.

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,839
God is always at work.

158
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,940
We may not recognize it, we may not see it,

159
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,940
but we can rest assured that God is always at work.

160
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,559
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

161
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,059
I'm going to deal with two thoughts very quickly

162
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,200
so that we can spend the bulk of our time

163
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,239
on my final thought this evening.

164
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,600
But when I think about looking at Genesis 42

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,079
and consider the fact that God is at work,

166
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,640
we notice first of all, God is working locally.

167
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,119
When I say that he's working locally,

168
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm saying he's working in Egypt.

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,200
Joseph was there, and you understand all the circumstances

170
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,880
with regard to the previous chapters

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,079
and all that we've studied in the life of Joseph,

172
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,399
and we see how God is working.

173
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,239
God had given Joseph the opportunity,

174
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,799
the ability to be able to interpret the dream,

175
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,440
to be able to come up with a plan

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,679
so that there would be food in Egypt.

177
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,959
God was at work in Egypt.

178
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,200
God was at work, not only locally,

179
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,279
but God was working globally.

180
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,920
We look at this particular portion of scripture,

181
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,480
and we find that this famine impacted more than just Egypt.

182
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,779
It was Pharaoh that had the dream.

183
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,619
It was Pharaoh that understood through this dream

184
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,320
that God gave, through Joseph's interpretation,

185
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
what was going to come

186
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,019
and how God was going to bring it to pass,

187
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,019
but understand that the famine impacted

188
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,019
more than just Egypt.

189
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,179
In fact, it says in verse 57

190
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,899
that all countries came into Egypt.

191
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,739
Why?

192
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,059
Because in Egypt, there was food,

193
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,459
and so God, listen, he knows where Jacob and the boys are.

194
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,940
He knows that they're in Canaan, and God is working.

195
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,179
He's working locally in Egypt.

196
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,739
He's working in Joseph's life.

197
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,000
He's working through those circumstances there,

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,260
but we find that he's working throughout the entire world,

199
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,859
and we find that here, the entire known world,

200
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,880
and we find that this particular famine

201
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,059
had an impact there in Canaan.

202
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,380
We see it in chapter 42 and verse number five.

203
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,779
Also in chapter 46 and verse number 31,

204
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,579
the Bible plainly tells us

205
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,660
that Joseph said unto his brethren

206
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,619
and unto his father's house,

207
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,260
I will go up and show Pharaoh and say unto him,

208
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,859
my brethren in my father's house,

209
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,340
which are in the land of Canaan, are come unto me,

210
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,140
and so they came from Canaan.

211
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,979
Why?

212
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,020
Because there was a famine.

213
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,140
God's working locally.

214
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,659
He's working globally,

215
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,140
but where I really wanna focus our attention this evening

216
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,380
and dig into this portion of Scripture

217
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,500
is that God is working personally.

218
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,760
Our God is a personal God.

219
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm thankful that God is at work in Egypt,

220
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,580
and God is at work throughout all of these lands

221
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,059
as we look in Genesis chapter number 42,

222
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,820
but the reality is that we see

223
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,140
as we dig into the portion of Scripture

224
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:08,099
that God is working in the lives of individuals,

225
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,140
and God still today, listen, God is working locally.

226
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,179
God is working globally,

227
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,140
but the amazing truth of how God is at work

228
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
is that he's at work personally.

229
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,260
He's working in people's lives.

230
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,580
We may not always see it.

231
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,020
We may be praying, and we don't see the results,

232
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,059
and we don't see how God is working,

233
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,580
but we can be confident,

234
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,619
and we can rest assured that God is at work.

235
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,940
God is at work in our lives.

236
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,340
As we dig through Genesis chapter 42,

237
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
and we begin to see how God is working

238
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,780
and what God is doing,

239
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,580
and how he, being an omnipresent God,

240
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,380
he's everywhere, but he's working

241
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,659
because he's a personal God.

242
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,299
He's working in the lives of individuals.

243
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,580
Can I say this this evening,

244
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,260
even before we dig into the rest

245
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,619
of the portion of Scripture tonight?

246
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,340
Sometimes when God is at work,

247
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:08,460
at work, it's uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable. Sometimes when God is at work, we might resist

248
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,340
it. We don't like it. You know, sometimes God is working and He's kind of peeling back

249
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,380
the layers of the skin of the onion, so to speak, to expose some things in our lives

250
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,860
that have to be dealt with. And you know, sometimes when God is at work, it's an uncomfortable

251
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,440
thing. And sometimes we don't really like it. But God is at work. We ought to rejoice

252
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,500
that God is at work. We ought to rejoice that God is interested in working in our lives

253
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,340
personally. We ought to rejoice when we come to the house of God and we hear the preaching

254
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,620
of God's Word. When we go in our daily devotions and we open up the Word of God and we begin

255
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,340
to read and God begins to prick our hearts through the personal reading, through the

256
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,260
public preaching, we ought to rejoice that God would work in our lives individually.

257
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,620
It's a blessed thing. I've said, not recently, but I've said over the years that it's a good

258
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:13,220
thing when God's people deal with that circumstance in which we feel the preaching and God's Word

259
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,040
will bring in our lives some conviction. Conviction is a good thing. When my toes and your toes

260
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,320
are stepped on, it's a good thing because God's at work. Notice as we look at this portion

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,160
of Scripture and consider that God is working personally, I would say, number one, that

262
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:38,520
God is working in Joseph's life. God is working in Joseph's life. We find that Joseph is here.

263
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,140
Notice we stopped reading in verse number five. Pick it up with me in verse number six

264
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,800
of Genesis 42. The Bible says, and Joseph was the governor over the land. Now we knew

265
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,760
that, did we not? We knew, based on studying through this portion of Scripture and studying

266
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,560
through the life of Joseph, we know that God elevated Joseph to a place of great authority.

267
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,080
And we find that Joseph is the governor of the land. We understand that his brothers

268
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,120
have no clue that Joseph is the governor of the land. But Joseph is the governor of the

269
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,680
land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land. Now I want you in your minds

270
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
eye, we'll finish reading verse number six here in just a moment, but in your mind's

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,680
eye this evening, I want you to consider the busyness of where Joseph is. I want you to

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,440
understand the number of people that would be in and out trying to buy food. Listen,

273
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,960
if you're in a position in which there's a great famine, so much so that you're considering

274
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,160
that you're going to die as a result of this famine and you need food, it's going to be

275
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,200
a busy place. There are going to be a lot of people in and out trying to buy food, trying

276
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,480
to survive. And we find that the people, all the people of the land, they came there

277
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,060
to where Joseph was. In fact, in verse 57 of chapter 41, it says, and all countries

278
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,280
came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn. Remember when the people, when the Egyptians

279
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,200
cried to Pharaoh, we have no food. What did he say? Go to Joseph. God's working in Joseph's

280
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,760
life. Why do I say that? Well, look at the rest of verse number six. And Joseph's brethren

281
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:24,200
came. And Joseph's brethren came. And Joseph's brethren came. We read through the text and

282
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,880
we understand that Joseph recognizes who they are. They don't know who he is. But when I

283
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,840
think about Joseph's brothers coming and it says that they bowed down themselves before

284
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:43,580
him with their faces to the earth and Joseph saw his brethren and he knew them, but made

285
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,740
himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them. And he said unto them, whence

286
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,580
came ye? And they said, from the land of Canaan to buy food. And so we find here in these

287
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,420
verses of scripture that God is working in Joseph's life. Why do I say that? Well, understand

288
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,140
that Joseph had some dreams about his brothers bowing down and the authority that he would

289
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,340
have and we see that this is being fulfilled here. But I also want you to understand that

290
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,260
Joseph is now coming face to face with the brothers that hated him, that wanted to kill

291
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,500
him, that wanted to, and eventually sold him into slavery. I want you to think about the

292
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,060
emotions of that. Listen, as we look in the life of Joseph, go back to chapter 41, if

293
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,940
you will, and look in verses 51 and 52 of Genesis chapter 41 and I want you to see that

294
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,620
as we look at this portion of scripture here and we understand what's taking place that

295
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,740
God tells us in Genesis 41 and verse number 51, and Joseph called the name of the firstborn

296
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,540
Manasseh. For God said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house and

297
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,540
the name of the second called he Ephraim. For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the

298
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,020
land of my affliction. We studied this several weeks ago when we looked at Joseph and we

299
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,460
talked about the principle of perspective from this portion of scripture and the fact

300
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,100
that he names his firstborn Manasseh, which means forgetfulness. He names his secondborn

301
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,540
Ephraim, which means fruitfulness. And we looked through and we dealt with that and

302
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:21,020
we understood that God had been working in the life of Joseph. But I want you to understand

303
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,860
that now as Joseph's brothers come face to face with him, that what he had believed in

304
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:36,980
and what he had handled now, those emotions are raw. He's face to face with his brothers.

305
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,940
How are you going to respond? How are you going to deal with that? Listen, I wonder

306
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,980
this evening if there's anything in you, someone walks into a room and you have ought against

307
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:55,140
them. I mean maybe they did you wrong. We're supposed to forgive. Joseph says forgetfulness

308
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,580
and fruitfulness and naming his sons. But you know when you come face to face with someone

309
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:08,660
that hurt you, they didn't seek his forgiveness, did they? No. Man, God's at work in the life

310
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,940
of Joseph. I believe that God is proving some things in the life of Joseph. You know God

311
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,480
will prove some things in our lives. It's easy to say things. There's a whole different

312
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,220
story to actually live it. It's one thing to say I forgive that person but then to interact

313
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,140
with that person. Would you agree? You say I forgive him but I never want to see him

314
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:37,300
again. Have you ever heard somebody say that? Sure you have. Is that true forgiveness? I

315
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:44,060
mean listen, remember sometimes when God's at work it's not comfortable. It's not comfortable.

316
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,500
Joseph is he standing there and he sees his brothers. It's been 20 years. His brothers

317
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,820
don't recognize him. No doubt there's been a great transformation in his even physical

318
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,820
appearance and then of course with wearing all of the Egyptian garb that he would have

319
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,740
on they don't recognize he speaks Egyptian no doubt and he's speaking through a translator

320
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,220
as you'd find as we continue studying through these chapters and we find that he knew his

321
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:15,420
brothers. God was at work. God was at work. We find that God is working in the life of

322
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Joseph but I would say that God is not only working in the life of Joseph but God is working

323
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,180
in the lives of Joseph's brothers. And really that's the bulk of this portion of scripture.

324
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Look in verse number 8. The Bible says, And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him

325
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,660
not. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye

326
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,100
are spies, to see the nakedness of the land, ye are come. And they said unto him, Nay,

327
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,060
my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. We are all one man's sons, we are true

328
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,660
men, thy servants are no spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of

329
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,420
the land, ye are come. They said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man

330
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:01,100
in the land of Canaan. Behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

331
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:09,020
Who is that? That's how they refer to him. One is not. They're talking to Joseph. The

332
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,340
one who they say is not. And we find that through this portion of scripture that Joseph,

333
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,220
I believe, as you study the life of Joseph, he was a man that sought the Lord, he followed

334
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,860
the Lord, he obeyed the Lord. I believe that in this interaction between Joseph and his

335
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,140
brothers, he is in obedience to God. When he's speaking roughly to them in all the

336
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,380
circumstances that are going on, I believe that Joseph is doing exactly what God has

337
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,860
instructed him to do. Joseph's not, he's not walking in the flesh in this portion of scripture.

338
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,300
I believe that Joseph is obedient to the Lord, but God is working in the lives of those brothers.

339
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,820
We're going to see it here in just a moment. Notice with me, the Bible says that he says

340
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,980
that they come to see the nakedness of the land in verse 14. And Joseph said unto them,

341
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,100
That is it that I spake unto you, saying, You're spies. Hereby ye shall be approved.

342
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,780
By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

343
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your

344
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,300
words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh,

345
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,180
surely, you're spies. And he, Joseph, put them, his brothers, all together into ward

346
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:32,780
three days. I think those were three long days. Don't you think so? They didn't know

347
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,020
what they were going to experience when they got to Egypt. They know that they were given

348
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,860
instruction from Dad to go buy corn in Egypt, and they arrive, and they immediately have

349
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,780
this interaction. Perhaps as they're waiting in line, as many are there to buy food, perhaps

350
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,820
they see person after person that stands, and they get their food, and they go on their

351
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,140
way. And then all of a sudden, they arrive, and there's all this questioning, and they're

352
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,260
put into ward. They're put into prison. There's this interaction. We find that

353
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,900
for three days, the Bible does not tell us

354
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,020
during this three-day period of time what they discuss.

355
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,820
However, when we look at verse number 21,

356
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,140
I think God gives us some insight

357
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,860
as to what they were discussing,

358
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,900
and what they were discussing were events

359
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,640
that took place over 20 years ago.

360
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,900
Notice with me that Joseph will keep it in context

361
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,420
in verse 18, after these three days, he says,

362
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
and Joseph said unto them, the third day,

363
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,300
this do and live, and then notice this phrase,

364
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,300
for I fear God, wow, now think about it,

365
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,940
Jacob sent his boys from Canaan to Egypt,

366
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,900
no doubt they had preconceived ideas about the Egyptians,

367
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,700
about their religion, about their polytheism,

368
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,020
and all of the things that they would be exposed to

369
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,640
and would deal with, and then as they're standing there,

370
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,600
speaking to the governor of the country,

371
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,720
the one who's in charge, he calls them out of prison

372
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,560
on the third day and says, for I fear God.

373
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,440
Wow, I believe God is working in the lives of these boys,

374
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
and God is going to continue as we look

375
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,840
through this portion of scripture,

376
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,320
how God is working and moving, he says this,

377
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,120
Joseph to his brothers in verse 19,

378
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
if ye be true men, let one of your brethren

379
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
be bound in the house of your prison,

380
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,640
go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses,

381
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,720
but bring your youngest brother unto me,

382
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,160
so shall your words be verified,

383
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,000
and ye shall not die, and they did so.

384
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,820
And then verse 21, it says, and they said one to another,

385
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,040
notice what they say, we find that Simeon remains in jail,

386
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,000
and we'll look through here, but notice in verse 21,

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,080
as they wander off, as they leave from the presence

388
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,640
of Joseph, they leave and the Bible says that they say,

389
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,720
we are guilty concerning our brother.

390
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,920
Why did they have that thought?

391
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Conviction, God was at work, nothing was said

392
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,600
about what they did to Joseph, nothing was said,

393
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
there was no insight that this was Joseph

394
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,020
that they were speaking to, it was God working

395
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,600
through these circumstances, it was God working

396
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,000
to bring conviction in the lives of these boys, why?

397
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Because ultimately, God wants to bring them back to himself.

398
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,320
That's what God's doing, and as they leave, listen,

399
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,240
nothing is said about Joseph, the only thing that's said

400
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,240
about Joseph and one is not, and they say, we are guilty,

401
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,680
we are guilty, we are guilty about what?

402
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Our brother, we are guilty concerning our brother.

403
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,160
I think for 20 long years, these things, it haunted them,

404
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,880
it haunted them what they did, why?

405
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,400
Because they never got it right, they never dealt with it.

406
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know how many times Jacob might have said

407
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
something about Joseph, and every time Dad would say

408
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,040
something about Joseph, how do you think

409
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
the 10 brothers feel?

410
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
They knew the truth, they knew what they did.

411
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,440
How do you think they felt when they saw Jacob

412
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,920
bereaving his son, I mean, he's weeping, no doubt.

413
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,840
I want you to think about it tonight, listen,

414
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,360
there are, and I know that the Bible doesn't tell us

415
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,120
all of this, but you know as a human being,

416
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,000
there are certain special events in your life,

417
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,080
there are things that take place in your life

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,920
that remind us, that trigger things in our lives,

419
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,680
maybe you've never heard of it, maybe you've never seen it,

420
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,960
but it triggers things in our lives,

421
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,880
maybe there's a special day, maybe it's a birthday,

422
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,320
as we would celebrate if we think about our own culture

423
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,200
and our own society, and you have a son who is not,

424
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,240
what happens on the day of their birth?

425
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
You think about that, do you not?

426
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,040
And when you think about that, perhaps you talk about that,

427
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,560
and those brothers that are under conviction,

428
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,400
and now they're standing there, listen,

429
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,400
all they wanted to do was buy food, but God was working,

430
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,880
God was working, God knew where they were,

431
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,880
God had orchestrated some events, why?

432
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,160
Because our God is a sovereign God,

433
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,200
and he had worked in such a way to elevate Joseph

434
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,119
to a place of prominence and of position,

435
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,160
and he had worked so that this famine would affect

436
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,119
not only Egypt, but also Canaan,

437
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,080
and all these other lands were impacted,

438
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,360
and now the brothers come, and they say,

439
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,000
we are guilty concerning our brother,

440
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,320
and that we saw, notice the rest of verse 21,

441
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,600
we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us,

442
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
and we would not hear,

443
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,600
therefore is this distress come upon us.

444
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,559
I believe that these brothers were convinced

445
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,839
that the reason for their trouble

446
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,160
was rooted in what happened 20 years earlier.

447
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Do you not, when you read verse 21?

448
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean, no one had to convince them of it.

449
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
You know who was working?

450
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,480
God, God was working.

451
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,839
It's amazing, sometimes I'll preach a message,

452
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,800
and someone will say something,

453
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,339
and I'm like, I don't even think I said anything about that.

454
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,720
It really wasn't even something

455
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,040
that was part of the message,

456
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,880
but you know what happened?

457
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,800
God was at work, God was moving, God was working.

458
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,839
I've sat in preaching services,

459
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,720
I've sat and I've listened to preaching,

460
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,400
and God will trigger through something that is said,

461
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
a verse that I read, another thought,

462
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
and I'll go over, and maybe I'll miss

463
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
the next few sentences that the preacher says,

464
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,100
but God's working in my life,

465
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,220
and that's how God works.

466
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,920
A journey that was expected to simply go

467
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,839
and buy some corn and go home

468
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,380
to provide food for the family.

469
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,940
God is at work, God is at work.

470
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,440
Notice the Bible says in verse 22,

471
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
and Reuben answered, he answered them saying,

472
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,680
spake I not unto you, saying,

473
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,520
do not sin against the child, and you would not hear.

474
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,279
Therefore, behold, also, his blood is required.

475
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,559
I mean, the conversation continues.

476
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,200
Reuben, he's going back, listen,

477
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
he remembers with clarity the conversation

478
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,380
that had taken place.

479
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,880
Remember, Reuben was the one that went back to the pit,

480
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,040
and Joseph wasn't there,

481
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,760
because they sold him into slavery,

482
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,880
and we find here in verse 23,

483
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,640
and they knew not that Joseph understood them,

484
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,640
for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

485
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,760
Joseph is standing there hearing all of this.

486
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,960
He's hearing this conversation between his brothers.

487
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,600
He's hearing, listen, he didn't bring it up.

488
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,559
It's an awesome thing when God works.

489
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,200
Sometimes a preacher gets accused of,

490
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,119
you're preaching that because you knew this was going on,

491
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,279
and so on and so forth.

492
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,000
Listen, if you preach the whole counsel of God,

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
you just let God work, honestly.

494
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,520
And when God works, you just sit back and say,

495
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,119
look at what God was doing.

496
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,559
Listen, I think it was Brother Hummel,

497
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,080
maybe it was Brother Mershon,

498
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,920
talked about someone coming and saying,

499
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,140
the preacher must have told you all about my life,

500
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,839
because all you've done is preach about the things

501
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,680
that I've been dealing with.

502
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
He's like, I don't have any idea.

503
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,680
God's dealing in your life.

504
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,800
God's at work.

505
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,680
Joseph didn't say anything about what happened 20 years ago,

506
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,160
but those boys were under conviction, deep conviction.

507
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,559
Notice in verse 24,

508
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,520
and he turned himself about from them and wept.

509
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,360
Joseph, again, remember we started out,

510
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,240
God was at work in Joseph's life.

511
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,960
He returned to them again and communed with them

512
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,440
and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes.

513
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,440
And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn.

514
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,600
Notice this, and to restore every man's money into a sack.

515
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,680
To give them provision for the way.

516
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,440
And thus did he unto them.

517
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,440
And they laid their asses with the corn and departed thence.

518
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
So we see what's happening.

519
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,160
Simeon remains behind,

520
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,160
nine of them are now going to travel back.

521
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,240
And Joseph gives this instruction.

522
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,880
Remember, he's the one in charge, he's the authority.

523
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,920
And he commands that their sacks be filled with corn,

524
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,360
but he also commands to restore every man's money,

525
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,280
notice where, into a sack.

526
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,200
He didn't just give the money back to them.

527
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,119
He said, put it back in their sack.

528
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,239
And we find that he also provided for them,

529
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:44,799
for their journey to give them provision for the way.

530
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,320
Verse 27, these nine brothers, Simeon is left in prison.

531
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,919
The nine brothers, they journey.

532
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,880
And it says, as one of them, we don't know which one,

533
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,160
opened his sack to give his ass for vendor in the inn,

534
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,160
he espied his money, for behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

535
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Now he knew that he had given the money.

536
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,400
He knew that he bought the corn.

537
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,640
And now he opens up to be able to give his animal,

538
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,760
the provision, the food.

539
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,160
And as he does so, he sees the money.

540
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, praise the Lord, God gave us our money.

541
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,400
That's not how they respond.

542
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,000
It's not how they respond, why?

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
Because God is at work.

544
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,600
Notice in verse 28, and he said unto his brethren,

545
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,239
my money is restored.

546
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,320
But I think it was this kind of tone of,

547
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,000
my money is restored?

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,840
Like, what's going on?

549
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,160
And lo, it is even in my sack.

550
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,280
And their heart, notice what it says, failed them.

551
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,200
Failed them.

552
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,559
And they were afraid.

553
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,919
Notice what they say to each other.

554
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,919
What is this that God hath done unto us?

555
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:05,079
God was at work. God was at work. And we find that in the lives of these brothers we see

556
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:12,559
it very distinctly through these events that are recorded in Genesis 42 that God is working.

557
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,519
Listen sometimes I've mentioned twice now and for a third time sometimes it's uncomfortable

558
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,079
when God is at work. Sometimes it means we need to deal with things that quite honestly

559
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,159
we just really don't want to deal with. You know what I mean by that? Sometimes we just

560
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:34,799
rather not deal with stuff. But God says I'm working in your life. I want you to be right

561
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,879
with me. We're going to observe the Lord's Supper tonight and only as God could do it.

562
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:43,759
I had written on my calendar, my desk calendar that we'd observe the Lord's Supper tonight

563
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,999
months ago. But I never communicated that to Holly to put in the bulletin. Yesterday

564
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:53,239
morning I was praying and God impressed upon my heart hey we've got to do the Lord's Supper

565
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,599
tomorrow night. I was like man I didn't tell Holly about it. We're in the middle. We're

566
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,359
going to have the open house yesterday. And then someone asked me yesterday they said

567
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,559
hey when, how often do you observe the Lord's Supper? I was like actually tomorrow night

568
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:13,279
we're observing the Lord's Supper. We talk about self-examination. We talk about the

569
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,159
process when the Bible says let a man examine himself. We sing the song nothing between

570
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:26,719
my soul and my Savior. And we think about this process of God being at work. I often

571
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:34,439
say when we deal with the subject of self-examination that it requires both humility and honesty.

572
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:41,199
Here's the reality of life. The reality of life is that I would rather inspect Armando

573
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:49,639
and Armando would rather inspect me. That's the reality of life. Why? Because it's a hard

574
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:55,599
thing to inspect yourself, to examine yourself. You know why? We think we're better than we

575
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:02,959
are. We think we really don't have any problems. We think we've got it all together. But then

576
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:16,679
God starts working. That bitterness, lack of forgiveness, that contention, unresolved.

577
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,439
I mean you just go down a list. I'm not going to go down through a list tonight. I'm just

578
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:23,919
going to mention a few things. But the reality is that God is working. Listen this was something

579
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,599
that happened 20 years earlier. I think that the brothers probably tried to suppress it

580
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,679
as much as they possibly could. Isn't that what we try to do? Try to suppress those things.

581
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,599
Try to suppress them. But you know what God does? He brings it right to the forefront.

582
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,439
We can deal with this. I can handle this. I'm thankful that God was working locally

583
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:51,359
and globally but God was working personally. Our God is a personal God. And He works in

584
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,799
the lives of His people. And as we allow Him to have His way, as we say as the psalmist

585
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:05,399
does in Psalm 139, God search me oh God. Search me oh God. And show me if there be

586
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,959
any wicked way in my life. Right? That's what the Bible teaches us. That process of self-examination.

587
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:15,479
And so we find that God is working in the lives of these brothers. They say what is

588
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:25,159
this that God hath done unto us? Surely we are guilty concerning our brother. And they

589
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:32,239
understand what is taking place and how God is working. God is at work in the life of

590
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:36,999
Joseph. God is at work in the lives of the ten brothers. I believe that God is at work

591
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:45,839
in Jacob's life. Look at verse 29. And they, nine of them, He sent ten out. And they, nine

592
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,319
of them, came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan. And notice what the next

593
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:58,999
phrase says. And told him all that befell unto them. They didn't just come back with

594
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:08,519
some food. They came back with a story. With an account of what took place. Here's what

595
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:17,119
happened. Dad you sent us there. We came back with food but a whole lot more. Now they don't

596
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,399
reveal everything to Jacob. They don't reveal to Jacob at this particular juncture. We don't,

597
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,679
we see that not a place here where they reveal what they have done and really the conviction

598
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,639
that they're dealing with. Why? They don't want to tell Jacob. So we find that the, verse

599
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,519
number 30, the man who is the Lord of the land. Now who is that? That's Joseph. That's

600
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,839
their younger brother. That's the one who is not. According to what they say in verse

601
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:51,119
number 13, and one is not, the man, the ruler of the land, he is Joseph. And it says the

602
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,319
man who is the Lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.

603
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:01,319
And we said unto him, we are true men, we are no spies. We be twelve brethren, sons

604
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:05,079
of our father. One is not, that's Joseph. And the youngest is this day with our father

605
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,199
in the land of Canaan. The man, the Lord of the country said unto us, hereby shall I know

606
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,559
that you are true men. Leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine

607
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,599
of your households and be gone. And bring your youngest brother unto me. Then shall

608
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,319
I know that you are no spies, but you are true men. So will I deliver you your brother,

609
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:26,559
that's Simeon, and ye shall traffic in the land. In other words, they'd be able to come

610
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,039
back and forth and receive the goods, the food that they would need during the time

611
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,639
of famine. Joseph was the one that knew it was going to be seven years long. We don't

612
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,799
know at this particular time exactly how much time has passed. You can kind of guess at

613
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:44,559
it. But the reality is that we find that when later on, when Joseph is revealing to

614
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,399
his brothers what was going on, he says in verse number 6 of chapter 45, for these two

615
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:54,379
years hath the famine been in the land. And so this is very early with regard to the seven

616
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:58,959
years of famine. And so he tells them, he gives the plan, and now the boys are telling

617
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:05,599
dad, these nine, verse 35, and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold,

618
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,679
every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when both they and their father saw the

619
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:18,399
bundles of money, they were afraid. And Jacob, their father, said unto them, Me have ye bereaved

620
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:25,879
of my children. Notice where he says, Joseph is not. He's dead in his mind. Simeon is not.

621
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:34,759
He's in prison in Egypt, right? And ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against

622
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:45,119
me. You know, Jacob, God was working in his life too. God was working in Jacob's life.

623
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,019
Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring them not to thee.

624
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:55,039
Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. Now obviously Reuben had

625
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,719
no way of being able to really guarantee that he'd be able to do that, but that's what he

626
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,959
says. In verse 38, he said, My son shall not go down with you. For his brother is dead,

627
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:10,039
and he is left alone. If mischief befall him by the way, and the witchy go, then shall

628
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:17,879
ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Listen, God's working in Jacob's

629
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:25,879
life. Jacob needs to learn to trust the Lord. Jacob needs to learn some things about who

630
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:32,319
God is and what God is able to do. In fact, as you fast forward through the life of Joseph

631
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:37,079
in the next several chapters, you find that it's reported that Joseph is alive. He makes

632
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,559
himself known to his brothers, and that news gets back to Jacob, and Jacob then will journey

633
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,839
to go into Egypt. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, we understand that God

634
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,679
is working personally in Genesis chapter 42. I wonder this evening, as we look at this

635
00:37:53,679 --> 00:38:01,939
portion of Scripture and we see the dialogue, we see the account, the events as they unfold

636
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:11,259
on this first visit to Egypt. So much more than what these 10 brothers expected. I don't

637
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:18,059
think for a moment they were thinking God was going to convict them, deal with them

638
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,739
in this manner. But I wonder as I look at this portion of Scripture, I'm amazed by the

639
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:32,899
sensitivity of them recognizing that God was at work. Think about it this way with me.

640
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:38,539
Sometimes we deal with circumstances and situations and we say, well, it's just bad luck, just

641
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:44,380
misfortune, just this thing happened. You know, these boys, I don't think they were

642
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:52,940
very close to God, but you know their immediate response? God is at work. What is this that

643
00:38:52,940 --> 00:39:04,559
God hath done unto us? I wonder tonight, how quick are we to acknowledge God working

644
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,979
in our lives? When that circumstance, whatever it might be, when this thing happens in your

645
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:16,219
life and in my life, we know, listen, we know that God is sovereign. We know that God is

646
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:24,579
a pursuing God. God is an intimate, personal God. We can stand here and say, I want to

647
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,139
be right with God. God wants you to be right with Him more than you could ever want to

648
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:37,820
be right with God. I believe that with all my heart tonight. Draw an eye unto God and

649
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:46,200
He'll draw an eye unto you. Amen? And I wonder tonight when that thing happens in my life

650
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:52,880
and in your life, do we recognize it as being the hand of God? Do we examine our lives and

651
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,880
say, what is God trying to teach me through this? How is God trying to grow me through

652
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,000
this?

653
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,559
this? How's God going to use me through this? Or do we just write it off as some kind of

654
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,800
bad misfortune, bad luck, whatever word we want to use to just kind of again continue

655
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:16,959
to suppress something? You understand what I'm saying tonight? These boys, God is at

656
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:25,760
work. What has God done to us? And I just wonder tonight, how's God working in our lives?

657
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,759
Do you see God working in your life? Do you hear the voice of God when you read the Bible,

658
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:35,919
when you come to church, when you hear the preaching of God's word? Is God working in

659
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:44,200
your life? Are there some things that God's putting his finger on? And maybe we don't

660
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,799
like it. Maybe we don't want to deal with it. But God's at work. And God's going to

661
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:57,560
continue to pursue. God's going to continue to pursue. And God wants you to not have

662
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,680
a hard heart, but to have a tender heart. He doesn't want us to be hardened, but to

663
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,279
be softened, to be tender. And this evening, as we look at Genesis chapter 42, we see how

664
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:18,080
God is working in the life of Joseph, the life of the brothers, the life of Jacob. I

665
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:24,120
just believe tonight that God's working in our lives as well. And I wonder, are we able

666
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,720
to recognize it? And how do we respond to it? What is God doing? How is God working?

667
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Will we let God be God and have his way? Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

668
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:49,319
you for loving us. God, we thank you for this portion of Scripture, for the opportunity

669
00:41:49,319 --> 00:42:01,239
to see how you're a personal God. Lord, I pray that in the quietness of the moment tonight,

670
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:10,520
as we've heard the preaching of your word, as we have a time of invitation even in preparation

671
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:18,559
for observing the Lord's Supper, God, I pray that you'd help us to examine ourselves. God,

672
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:31,039
I pray that you'd help us to submit, to surrender to thee. Lord, I don't know how you're working

673
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:39,479
in everyone's life. I believe that you are at work. And I know at times it's uncomfortable,

674
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:49,880
it's difficult. But God, I pray that you'd help us to submit and surrender. God, we would

675
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,679
see and acknowledge that you are at work. Would you have your will and way in these

676
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,880
moments of invitation? Well, thank you for what you'll do. For it's in Christ's name

677
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,559
we pray.
