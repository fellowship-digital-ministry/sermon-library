WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
42, and I am thankful for the blessings of the Lord.

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:05.800
Had a number of folks that were traveling

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.739
that God has brought back safely.

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:09.239
Have some folks that continue to travel.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:10.439
Want you to pray for them.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.880
And then Brother Fernando,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.600
his grandmother had surgery last evening

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280
and he sent me a text.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.719
I mentioned this in Sunday School

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.280
and he sent me a text and we prayed

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.079
and we're thankful that that surgery went well

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.680
and she's recovering well

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.559
and so we praise the Lord for that.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.959
And it's amazing our God does here

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.319
and answer prayer, amen.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.159
And every time we go to the Lord in prayer,

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.279
we have that confidence knowing that he hears us

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:39.279
and that he's able and we certainly are encouraged

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.880
each time he answers prayer.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.159
Genesis chapter 42 this evening

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.240
and we'll look at the entire chapter.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000
Genesis 42, one through 38.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.959
I'm not gonna read the entire text this evening.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm gonna just kind of jump through the text

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.759
of scripture this evening

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.619
as we deal with this subject matter.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.840
But notice beginning in verse number one in Genesis 42,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.680
the Bible says,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.680
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.120
Jacob said unto his sons,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.400
why do you look one upon another?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.239
And he said, behold,

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.199
I have heard that there's corn in Egypt.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.599
Get you down thither and buy for us from fence

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.319
that we may live and not die.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.360
And Joseph's 10 brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.080
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.559
Jacob sent not with his brethren

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:28.599
for he said, lest peradventure mischief

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.120
befall him.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.919
The sons of Israel came to buy corn

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.480
among those that came for the famine

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.120
was in the land of Canaan.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.959
We'll dig in further through the text

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.959
as we study through this portion of scripture this evening.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.440
But you understand that the seven years of great plenty

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800
had ended and the seven years of dearth began

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.959
according to the end of chapter number 41

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.319
of the book of Genesis.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.400
We find that Joseph was diligent

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.839
during those seven years of great plenty.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.360
And we find that because of his diligence

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.599
and his obedience to follow that

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.919
which God had revealed to him,

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:06.680
we find that there was food in Egypt.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.679
Now we understand that as we look at this

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.360
and dig into chapter number 42,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.479
it says now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.080
And so we find that as we back up just a little bit

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.639
into chapter 41, by way of introduction,

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.520
we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 54,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.279
notice of chapter 41, verse 54.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.759
And the seven years of dearth began to come

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.119
according as Joseph had said,

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.839
and the dearth was in all lands.

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.080
But in the land of Egypt, there was bread.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.800
Again, you see in verse number 57,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.039
notice it says in all countries

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.000
came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.839
Why?

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:49.300
Because the famine was so sore in all lands.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.800
We find that there in chapter number 42

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.199
in verse number five, at the end of the verse,

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.039
it says that the famine was in the land of Canaan as well.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.119
And so we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.199
I've titled the message this evening,

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.360
Joseph's brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360
And you see that in verse number three,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.279
and we find that throughout this passage of scripture

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.580
that God records for us this journey

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.800
that these 10 brothers took from Canaan to Egypt

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.360
for the purpose of getting food, of buying corn.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.160
And we find that as God would rehearse for us

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.600
the account as it takes place,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.639
that these 10 brothers, of course,

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.279
they meet their brother, Joseph.

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.880
Their brother who they had sold into slavery,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.520
their brother that nearly 20 years had passed

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.679
since the last time they had seen him.

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.419
And we find that Joseph now

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.279
is in this elevated position of leadership.

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.160
We've studied through the book of Genesis.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.440
We've understood the things that have taken place.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.919
And we find that now these brothers,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.300
because of what Jacob understood to be true,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.559
in verse number one of chapter 42,

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.479
the Bible says that Jacob saw

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.960
that there was corn in Egypt.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960
In chapter 42 in verse number two,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.679
it says that Jacob heard there was corn in Egypt.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.720
And so Jacob, upon understanding

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.339
the fact that there was a source of food

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.880
and understanding the circumstances

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.799
in which they were facing,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.559
it was a real bad time

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:25.320
because of this great dearth

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.480
that had came upon the land.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.200
And notice at the end of verse number two,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.679
he says that we may live and not die.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:34.420
That gives us some insight

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.239
with regard to the conditions

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:38.279
and how bad it really was.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.880
And so we find that Jacob,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.600
understanding all of these things

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.239
and what he was experiencing,

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:45.239
we find that he sends his boys,

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:47.600
these 10 sons, to Egypt.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.559
He did not send Benjamin, the youngest.

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:50.399
Why?

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.239
Well, because he'd already lost Joseph

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:53.899
and he did not want any mischief

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.760
to fall upon Benjamin.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.440
In his mind, remember,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.959
Jacob had every part of his being

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.799
believe that Joseph was killed.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:05.320
When his brothers came back

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.320
and they said, hey, we found this.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.420
Do you know whose this is?

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.619
What was it that they showed him?

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.140
The coat of many colors

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.440
that Jacob had given to his son

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.359
and they had dipped it in blood.

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:16.480
Remember, they killed an animal,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.440
they dipped it in blood

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.119
and they said, we found this.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.519
And what did Jacob believe?

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:23.040
A wild beast hath devoured him.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.000
He believed that he was dead.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.760
And the brothers, his sons,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.799
his own sons allowed him to believe that lie.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.760
And now we find that we come to chapter 42.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.260
So many, I mean, 20 years,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.519
at least a minimum of 20 years has passed

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.839
between the time in which Jacob,

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.399
his sons sold Joseph into slavery.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.519
And now as they're dealing with this great famine,

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:51.839
and we find that as we read through Genesis chapter 42,

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.600
that as we look at the dialogue

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.640
that God provides of this record and this account

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.320
and all the interactions that take place,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.320
really what we find is that God is at work.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.279
God is working.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.480
In fact, as we look at this portion of scripture

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.239
and we look at the circumstances

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:13.320
that are recorded here in Genesis 42,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.320
it really reminds us that God is always at work.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.839
God is always at work.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.940
We may not recognize it, we may not see it,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.940
but we can rest assured that God is always at work.

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.559
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.059
I'm going to deal with two thoughts very quickly

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.200
so that we can spend the bulk of our time

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.239
on my final thought this evening.

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:41.600
But when I think about looking at Genesis 42

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.079
and consider the fact that God is at work,

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.640
we notice first of all, God is working locally.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.119
When I say that he's working locally,

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.480
I'm saying he's working in Egypt.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.200
Joseph was there, and you understand all the circumstances

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.880
with regard to the previous chapters

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.079
and all that we've studied in the life of Joseph,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:01.399
and we see how God is working.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.239
God had given Joseph the opportunity,

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:06.799
the ability to be able to interpret the dream,

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.440
to be able to come up with a plan

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.679
so that there would be food in Egypt.

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:14.959
God was at work in Egypt.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.200
God was at work, not only locally,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.279
but God was working globally.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:21.920
We look at this particular portion of scripture,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.480
and we find that this famine impacted more than just Egypt.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.779
It was Pharaoh that had the dream.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.619
It was Pharaoh that understood through this dream

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:35.320
that God gave, through Joseph's interpretation,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.720
what was going to come

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.019
and how God was going to bring it to pass,

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.019
but understand that the famine impacted

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.019
more than just Egypt.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:44.179
In fact, it says in verse 57

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:46.899
that all countries came into Egypt.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.739
Why?

00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:49.059
Because in Egypt, there was food,

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.459
and so God, listen, he knows where Jacob and the boys are.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:55.940
He knows that they're in Canaan, and God is working.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.179
He's working locally in Egypt.

00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.739
He's working in Joseph's life.

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.000
He's working through those circumstances there,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.260
but we find that he's working throughout the entire world,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.859
and we find that here, the entire known world,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.880
and we find that this particular famine

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.059
had an impact there in Canaan.

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:16.380
We see it in chapter 42 and verse number five.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.779
Also in chapter 46 and verse number 31,

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:21.579
the Bible plainly tells us

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:23.660
that Joseph said unto his brethren

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.619
and unto his father's house,

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:28.260
I will go up and show Pharaoh and say unto him,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.859
my brethren in my father's house,

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:32.340
which are in the land of Canaan, are come unto me,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.140
and so they came from Canaan.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.979
Why?

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:36.020
Because there was a famine.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.140
God's working locally.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.659
He's working globally,

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.140
but where I really wanna focus our attention this evening

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.380
and dig into this portion of Scripture

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.500
is that God is working personally.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.760
Our God is a personal God.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.700
I'm thankful that God is at work in Egypt,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.580
and God is at work throughout all of these lands

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.059
as we look in Genesis chapter number 42,

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:01.820
but the reality is that we see

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.140
as we dig into the portion of Scripture

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:08.099
that God is working in the lives of individuals,

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:11.140
and God still today, listen, God is working locally.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.179
God is working globally,

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:17.140
but the amazing truth of how God is at work

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.140
is that he's at work personally.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.260
He's working in people's lives.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.580
We may not always see it.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.020
We may be praying, and we don't see the results,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.059
and we don't see how God is working,

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.580
but we can be confident,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.619
and we can rest assured that God is at work.

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:34.940
God is at work in our lives.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.340
As we dig through Genesis chapter 42,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.340
and we begin to see how God is working

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.780
and what God is doing,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.580
and how he, being an omnipresent God,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.380
he's everywhere, but he's working

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.659
because he's a personal God.

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:52.299
He's working in the lives of individuals.

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:53.580
Can I say this this evening,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.260
even before we dig into the rest

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.619
of the portion of Scripture tonight?

00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:00.340
Sometimes when God is at work,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:08.460
at work, it's uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable. Sometimes when God is at work, we might resist

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:15.340
it. We don't like it. You know, sometimes God is working and He's kind of peeling back

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.380
the layers of the skin of the onion, so to speak, to expose some things in our lives

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.860
that have to be dealt with. And you know, sometimes when God is at work, it's an uncomfortable

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:33.440
thing. And sometimes we don't really like it. But God is at work. We ought to rejoice

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.500
that God is at work. We ought to rejoice that God is interested in working in our lives

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.340
personally. We ought to rejoice when we come to the house of God and we hear the preaching

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.620
of God's Word. When we go in our daily devotions and we open up the Word of God and we begin

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.340
to read and God begins to prick our hearts through the personal reading, through the

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.260
public preaching, we ought to rejoice that God would work in our lives individually.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.620
It's a blessed thing. I've said, not recently, but I've said over the years that it's a good

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:13.220
thing when God's people deal with that circumstance in which we feel the preaching and God's Word

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:20.040
will bring in our lives some conviction. Conviction is a good thing. When my toes and your toes

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.320
are stepped on, it's a good thing because God's at work. Notice as we look at this portion

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.160
of Scripture and consider that God is working personally, I would say, number one, that

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:38.520
God is working in Joseph's life. God is working in Joseph's life. We find that Joseph is here.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.140
Notice we stopped reading in verse number five. Pick it up with me in verse number six

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.800
of Genesis 42. The Bible says, and Joseph was the governor over the land. Now we knew

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.760
that, did we not? We knew, based on studying through this portion of Scripture and studying

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:58.560
through the life of Joseph, we know that God elevated Joseph to a place of great authority.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.080
And we find that Joseph is the governor of the land. We understand that his brothers

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:09.120
have no clue that Joseph is the governor of the land. But Joseph is the governor of the

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.680
land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land. Now I want you in your minds

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.440
eye, we'll finish reading verse number six here in just a moment, but in your mind's

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.680
eye this evening, I want you to consider the busyness of where Joseph is. I want you to

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.440
understand the number of people that would be in and out trying to buy food. Listen,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.960
if you're in a position in which there's a great famine, so much so that you're considering

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.160
that you're going to die as a result of this famine and you need food, it's going to be

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.200
a busy place. There are going to be a lot of people in and out trying to buy food, trying

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.480
to survive. And we find that the people, all the people of the land, they came there

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.060
to where Joseph was. In fact, in verse 57 of chapter 41, it says, and all countries

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.280
came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn. Remember when the people, when the Egyptians

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:07.200
cried to Pharaoh, we have no food. What did he say? Go to Joseph. God's working in Joseph's

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.760
life. Why do I say that? Well, look at the rest of verse number six. And Joseph's brethren

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:24.200
came. And Joseph's brethren came. And Joseph's brethren came. We read through the text and

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.880
we understand that Joseph recognizes who they are. They don't know who he is. But when I

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.840
think about Joseph's brothers coming and it says that they bowed down themselves before

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:43.580
him with their faces to the earth and Joseph saw his brethren and he knew them, but made

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.740
himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them. And he said unto them, whence

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.580
came ye? And they said, from the land of Canaan to buy food. And so we find here in these

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.420
verses of scripture that God is working in Joseph's life. Why do I say that? Well, understand

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.140
that Joseph had some dreams about his brothers bowing down and the authority that he would

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.340
have and we see that this is being fulfilled here. But I also want you to understand that

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:14.260
Joseph is now coming face to face with the brothers that hated him, that wanted to kill

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.500
him, that wanted to, and eventually sold him into slavery. I want you to think about the

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:26.060
emotions of that. Listen, as we look in the life of Joseph, go back to chapter 41, if

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:32.940
you will, and look in verses 51 and 52 of Genesis chapter 41 and I want you to see that

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.620
as we look at this portion of scripture here and we understand what's taking place that

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.740
God tells us in Genesis 41 and verse number 51, and Joseph called the name of the firstborn

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:49.540
Manasseh. For God said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house and

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.540
the name of the second called he Ephraim. For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the

00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:00.020
land of my affliction. We studied this several weeks ago when we looked at Joseph and we

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.460
talked about the principle of perspective from this portion of scripture and the fact

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.100
that he names his firstborn Manasseh, which means forgetfulness. He names his secondborn

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.540
Ephraim, which means fruitfulness. And we looked through and we dealt with that and

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:21.020
we understood that God had been working in the life of Joseph. But I want you to understand

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:27.860
that now as Joseph's brothers come face to face with him, that what he had believed in

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:36.980
and what he had handled now, those emotions are raw. He's face to face with his brothers.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.940
How are you going to respond? How are you going to deal with that? Listen, I wonder

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.980
this evening if there's anything in you, someone walks into a room and you have ought against

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:55.140
them. I mean maybe they did you wrong. We're supposed to forgive. Joseph says forgetfulness

00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:00.580
and fruitfulness and naming his sons. But you know when you come face to face with someone

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:08.660
that hurt you, they didn't seek his forgiveness, did they? No. Man, God's at work in the life

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.940
of Joseph. I believe that God is proving some things in the life of Joseph. You know God

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.480
will prove some things in our lives. It's easy to say things. There's a whole different

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.220
story to actually live it. It's one thing to say I forgive that person but then to interact

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:29.140
with that person. Would you agree? You say I forgive him but I never want to see him

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:37.300
again. Have you ever heard somebody say that? Sure you have. Is that true forgiveness? I

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:44.060
mean listen, remember sometimes when God's at work it's not comfortable. It's not comfortable.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.500
Joseph is he standing there and he sees his brothers. It's been 20 years. His brothers

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.820
don't recognize him. No doubt there's been a great transformation in his even physical

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.820
appearance and then of course with wearing all of the Egyptian garb that he would have

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.740
on they don't recognize he speaks Egyptian no doubt and he's speaking through a translator

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.220
as you'd find as we continue studying through these chapters and we find that he knew his

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:15.420
brothers. God was at work. God was at work. We find that God is working in the life of

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.420
Joseph but I would say that God is not only working in the life of Joseph but God is working

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:26.180
in the lives of Joseph's brothers. And really that's the bulk of this portion of scripture.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.180
Look in verse number 8. The Bible says, And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.660
not. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.100
are spies, to see the nakedness of the land, ye are come. And they said unto him, Nay,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.060
my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. We are all one man's sons, we are true

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.660
men, thy servants are no spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.420
the land, ye are come. They said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:01.100
in the land of Canaan. Behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:09.020
Who is that? That's how they refer to him. One is not. They're talking to Joseph. The

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:15.340
one who they say is not. And we find that through this portion of scripture that Joseph,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.220
I believe, as you study the life of Joseph, he was a man that sought the Lord, he followed

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.860
the Lord, he obeyed the Lord. I believe that in this interaction between Joseph and his

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:31.140
brothers, he is in obedience to God. When he's speaking roughly to them in all the

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.380
circumstances that are going on, I believe that Joseph is doing exactly what God has

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.860
instructed him to do. Joseph's not, he's not walking in the flesh in this portion of scripture.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:46.300
I believe that Joseph is obedient to the Lord, but God is working in the lives of those brothers.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.820
We're going to see it here in just a moment. Notice with me, the Bible says that he says

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.980
that they come to see the nakedness of the land in verse 14. And Joseph said unto them,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:01.100
That is it that I spake unto you, saying, You're spies. Hereby ye shall be approved.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.780
By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.780
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.300
words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:26.180
surely, you're spies. And he, Joseph, put them, his brothers, all together into ward

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:32.780
three days. I think those were three long days. Don't you think so? They didn't know

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.020
what they were going to experience when they got to Egypt. They know that they were given

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.860
instruction from Dad to go buy corn in Egypt, and they arrive, and they immediately have

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.780
this interaction. Perhaps as they're waiting in line, as many are there to buy food, perhaps

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.820
they see person after person that stands, and they get their food, and they go on their

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.140
way. And then all of a sudden, they arrive, and there's all this questioning, and they're

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.260
put into ward. They're put into prison. There's this interaction. We find that

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.900
for three days, the Bible does not tell us

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.020
during this three-day period of time what they discuss.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.820
However, when we look at verse number 21,

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.140
I think God gives us some insight

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.860
as to what they were discussing,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.900
and what they were discussing were events

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.640
that took place over 20 years ago.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.900
Notice with me that Joseph will keep it in context

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.420
in verse 18, after these three days, he says,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.420
and Joseph said unto them, the third day,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.300
this do and live, and then notice this phrase,

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.300
for I fear God, wow, now think about it,

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.940
Jacob sent his boys from Canaan to Egypt,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.900
no doubt they had preconceived ideas about the Egyptians,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.700
about their religion, about their polytheism,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.020
and all of the things that they would be exposed to

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.640
and would deal with, and then as they're standing there,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.600
speaking to the governor of the country,

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.720
the one who's in charge, he calls them out of prison

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.560
on the third day and says, for I fear God.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.440
Wow, I believe God is working in the lives of these boys,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.440
and God is going to continue as we look

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.840
through this portion of scripture,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.320
how God is working and moving, he says this,

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.120
Joseph to his brothers in verse 19,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.280
if ye be true men, let one of your brethren

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.480
be bound in the house of your prison,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.640
go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.720
but bring your youngest brother unto me,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.160
so shall your words be verified,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.000
and ye shall not die, and they did so.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.820
And then verse 21, it says, and they said one to another,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.040
notice what they say, we find that Simeon remains in jail,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.000
and we'll look through here, but notice in verse 21,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.080
as they wander off, as they leave from the presence

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.640
of Joseph, they leave and the Bible says that they say,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.720
we are guilty concerning our brother.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.920
Why did they have that thought?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.560
Conviction, God was at work, nothing was said

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.600
about what they did to Joseph, nothing was said,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.000
there was no insight that this was Joseph

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.020
that they were speaking to, it was God working

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.600
through these circumstances, it was God working

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.000
to bring conviction in the lives of these boys, why?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.880
Because ultimately, God wants to bring them back to himself.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.320
That's what God's doing, and as they leave, listen,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.240
nothing is said about Joseph, the only thing that's said

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.240
about Joseph and one is not, and they say, we are guilty,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.680
we are guilty, we are guilty about what?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.680
Our brother, we are guilty concerning our brother.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.160
I think for 20 long years, these things, it haunted them,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.880
it haunted them what they did, why?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.400
Because they never got it right, they never dealt with it.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.000
I don't know how many times Jacob might have said

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
something about Joseph, and every time Dad would say

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.040
something about Joseph, how do you think

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.160
the 10 brothers feel?

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.240
They knew the truth, they knew what they did.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.440
How do you think they felt when they saw Jacob

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.920
bereaving his son, I mean, he's weeping, no doubt.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.840
I want you to think about it tonight, listen,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.360
there are, and I know that the Bible doesn't tell us

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.120
all of this, but you know as a human being,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.000
there are certain special events in your life,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.080
there are things that take place in your life

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.920
that remind us, that trigger things in our lives,

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.680
maybe you've never heard of it, maybe you've never seen it,

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.960
but it triggers things in our lives,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.880
maybe there's a special day, maybe it's a birthday,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.320
as we would celebrate if we think about our own culture

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.200
and our own society, and you have a son who is not,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.240
what happens on the day of their birth?

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.240
You think about that, do you not?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.040
And when you think about that, perhaps you talk about that,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.560
and those brothers that are under conviction,

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.400
and now they're standing there, listen,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.400
all they wanted to do was buy food, but God was working,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.880
God was working, God knew where they were,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.880
God had orchestrated some events, why?

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.160
Because our God is a sovereign God,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.200
and he had worked in such a way to elevate Joseph

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.119
to a place of prominence and of position,

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:31.160
and he had worked so that this famine would affect

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.119
not only Egypt, but also Canaan,

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:35.080
and all these other lands were impacted,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.360
and now the brothers come, and they say,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.000
we are guilty concerning our brother,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.320
and that we saw, notice the rest of verse 21,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.600
we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.600
and we would not hear,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.600
therefore is this distress come upon us.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.559
I believe that these brothers were convinced

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.839
that the reason for their trouble

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.160
was rooted in what happened 20 years earlier.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.160
Do you not, when you read verse 21?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.000
I mean, no one had to convince them of it.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.520
You know who was working?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.480
God, God was working.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.839
It's amazing, sometimes I'll preach a message,

00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:19.800
and someone will say something,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.339
and I'm like, I don't even think I said anything about that.

00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:24.720
It really wasn't even something

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.040
that was part of the message,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.880
but you know what happened?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.800
God was at work, God was moving, God was working.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.839
I've sat in preaching services,

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.720
I've sat and I've listened to preaching,

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.400
and God will trigger through something that is said,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.400
a verse that I read, another thought,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.320
and I'll go over, and maybe I'll miss

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.720
the next few sentences that the preacher says,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.100
but God's working in my life,

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.220
and that's how God works.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.920
A journey that was expected to simply go

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.839
and buy some corn and go home

00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:01.380
to provide food for the family.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.940
God is at work, God is at work.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.440
Notice the Bible says in verse 22,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.320
and Reuben answered, he answered them saying,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.680
spake I not unto you, saying,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.520
do not sin against the child, and you would not hear.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.279
Therefore, behold, also, his blood is required.

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.559
I mean, the conversation continues.

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:25.200
Reuben, he's going back, listen,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.559
he remembers with clarity the conversation

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:29.380
that had taken place.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.880
Remember, Reuben was the one that went back to the pit,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.040
and Joseph wasn't there,

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.760
because they sold him into slavery,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.880
and we find here in verse 23,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.640
and they knew not that Joseph understood them,

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:45.640
for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.760
Joseph is standing there hearing all of this.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.960
He's hearing this conversation between his brothers.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.600
He's hearing, listen, he didn't bring it up.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.559
It's an awesome thing when God works.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.200
Sometimes a preacher gets accused of,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.119
you're preaching that because you knew this was going on,

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:05.279
and so on and so forth.

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.000
Listen, if you preach the whole counsel of God,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
you just let God work, honestly.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.520
And when God works, you just sit back and say,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.119
look at what God was doing.

00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:17.559
Listen, I think it was Brother Hummel,

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:19.080
maybe it was Brother Mershon,

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.920
talked about someone coming and saying,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.140
the preacher must have told you all about my life,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.839
because all you've done is preach about the things

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.680
that I've been dealing with.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.600
He's like, I don't have any idea.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.680
God's dealing in your life.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.800
God's at work.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.680
Joseph didn't say anything about what happened 20 years ago,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.160
but those boys were under conviction, deep conviction.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.559
Notice in verse 24,

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.520
and he turned himself about from them and wept.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.360
Joseph, again, remember we started out,

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.240
God was at work in Joseph's life.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.960
He returned to them again and communed with them

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.440
and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.440
And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.600
Notice this, and to restore every man's money into a sack.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.680
To give them provision for the way.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.440
And thus did he unto them.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.440
And they laid their asses with the corn and departed thence.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.720
So we see what's happening.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.160
Simeon remains behind,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.160
nine of them are now going to travel back.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.240
And Joseph gives this instruction.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.880
Remember, he's the one in charge, he's the authority.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.920
And he commands that their sacks be filled with corn,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.360
but he also commands to restore every man's money,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.280
notice where, into a sack.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.200
He didn't just give the money back to them.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.119
He said, put it back in their sack.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:41.239
And we find that he also provided for them,

00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:44.799
for their journey to give them provision for the way.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.320
Verse 27, these nine brothers, Simeon is left in prison.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.919
The nine brothers, they journey.

00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:53.880
And it says, as one of them, we don't know which one,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.160
opened his sack to give his ass for vendor in the inn,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.160
he espied his money, for behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.080
Now he knew that he had given the money.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.400
He knew that he bought the corn.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.640
And now he opens up to be able to give his animal,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.760
the provision, the food.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.160
And as he does so, he sees the money.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.000
Oh, praise the Lord, God gave us our money.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.400
That's not how they respond.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.000
It's not how they respond, why?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.080
Because God is at work.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.600
Notice in verse 28, and he said unto his brethren,

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.239
my money is restored.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.320
But I think it was this kind of tone of,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.000
my money is restored?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.840
Like, what's going on?

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.160
And lo, it is even in my sack.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.280
And their heart, notice what it says, failed them.

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:47.200
Failed them.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.559
And they were afraid.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.919
Notice what they say to each other.

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:56.919
What is this that God hath done unto us?

00:29:56.919 --> 00:30:05.079
God was at work. God was at work. And we find that in the lives of these brothers we see

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:12.559
it very distinctly through these events that are recorded in Genesis 42 that God is working.

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:17.519
Listen sometimes I've mentioned twice now and for a third time sometimes it's uncomfortable

00:30:17.519 --> 00:30:22.079
when God is at work. Sometimes it means we need to deal with things that quite honestly

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:27.159
we just really don't want to deal with. You know what I mean by that? Sometimes we just

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:34.799
rather not deal with stuff. But God says I'm working in your life. I want you to be right

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:38.879
with me. We're going to observe the Lord's Supper tonight and only as God could do it.

00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:43.759
I had written on my calendar, my desk calendar that we'd observe the Lord's Supper tonight

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:49.999
months ago. But I never communicated that to Holly to put in the bulletin. Yesterday

00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:53.239
morning I was praying and God impressed upon my heart hey we've got to do the Lord's Supper

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:56.599
tomorrow night. I was like man I didn't tell Holly about it. We're in the middle. We're

00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:00.359
going to have the open house yesterday. And then someone asked me yesterday they said

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:04.559
hey when, how often do you observe the Lord's Supper? I was like actually tomorrow night

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:13.279
we're observing the Lord's Supper. We talk about self-examination. We talk about the

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:19.159
process when the Bible says let a man examine himself. We sing the song nothing between

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:26.719
my soul and my Savior. And we think about this process of God being at work. I often

00:31:26.719 --> 00:31:34.439
say when we deal with the subject of self-examination that it requires both humility and honesty.

00:31:34.439 --> 00:31:41.199
Here's the reality of life. The reality of life is that I would rather inspect Armando

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:49.639
and Armando would rather inspect me. That's the reality of life. Why? Because it's a hard

00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:55.599
thing to inspect yourself, to examine yourself. You know why? We think we're better than we

00:31:55.599 --> 00:32:02.959
are. We think we really don't have any problems. We think we've got it all together. But then

00:32:02.959 --> 00:32:16.679
God starts working. That bitterness, lack of forgiveness, that contention, unresolved.

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:19.439
I mean you just go down a list. I'm not going to go down through a list tonight. I'm just

00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:23.919
going to mention a few things. But the reality is that God is working. Listen this was something

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:29.599
that happened 20 years earlier. I think that the brothers probably tried to suppress it

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:34.679
as much as they possibly could. Isn't that what we try to do? Try to suppress those things.

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:39.599
Try to suppress them. But you know what God does? He brings it right to the forefront.

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:45.439
We can deal with this. I can handle this. I'm thankful that God was working locally

00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:51.359
and globally but God was working personally. Our God is a personal God. And He works in

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:56.799
the lives of His people. And as we allow Him to have His way, as we say as the psalmist

00:32:56.799 --> 00:33:05.399
does in Psalm 139, God search me oh God. Search me oh God. And show me if there be

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:10.959
any wicked way in my life. Right? That's what the Bible teaches us. That process of self-examination.

00:33:10.959 --> 00:33:15.479
And so we find that God is working in the lives of these brothers. They say what is

00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:25.159
this that God hath done unto us? Surely we are guilty concerning our brother. And they

00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:32.239
understand what is taking place and how God is working. God is at work in the life of

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:36.999
Joseph. God is at work in the lives of the ten brothers. I believe that God is at work

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:45.839
in Jacob's life. Look at verse 29. And they, nine of them, He sent ten out. And they, nine

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:51.319
of them, came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan. And notice what the next

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:58.999
phrase says. And told him all that befell unto them. They didn't just come back with

00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:08.519
some food. They came back with a story. With an account of what took place. Here's what

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:17.119
happened. Dad you sent us there. We came back with food but a whole lot more. Now they don't

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:22.399
reveal everything to Jacob. They don't reveal to Jacob at this particular juncture. We don't,

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:27.679
we see that not a place here where they reveal what they have done and really the conviction

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:33.639
that they're dealing with. Why? They don't want to tell Jacob. So we find that the, verse

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:38.519
number 30, the man who is the Lord of the land. Now who is that? That's Joseph. That's

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:43.839
their younger brother. That's the one who is not. According to what they say in verse

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:51.119
number 13, and one is not, the man, the ruler of the land, he is Joseph. And it says the

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:57.319
man who is the Lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.

00:34:57.319 --> 00:35:01.319
And we said unto him, we are true men, we are no spies. We be twelve brethren, sons

00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:05.079
of our father. One is not, that's Joseph. And the youngest is this day with our father

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:09.199
in the land of Canaan. The man, the Lord of the country said unto us, hereby shall I know

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:13.559
that you are true men. Leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:18.599
of your households and be gone. And bring your youngest brother unto me. Then shall

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:23.319
I know that you are no spies, but you are true men. So will I deliver you your brother,

00:35:23.319 --> 00:35:26.559
that's Simeon, and ye shall traffic in the land. In other words, they'd be able to come

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:30.039
back and forth and receive the goods, the food that they would need during the time

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:33.639
of famine. Joseph was the one that knew it was going to be seven years long. We don't

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:37.799
know at this particular time exactly how much time has passed. You can kind of guess at

00:35:37.799 --> 00:35:44.559
it. But the reality is that we find that when later on, when Joseph is revealing to

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:49.399
his brothers what was going on, he says in verse number 6 of chapter 45, for these two

00:35:49.399 --> 00:35:54.379
years hath the famine been in the land. And so this is very early with regard to the seven

00:35:54.379 --> 00:35:58.959
years of famine. And so he tells them, he gives the plan, and now the boys are telling

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:05.599
dad, these nine, verse 35, and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold,

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:09.679
every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when both they and their father saw the

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:18.399
bundles of money, they were afraid. And Jacob, their father, said unto them, Me have ye bereaved

00:36:18.399 --> 00:36:25.879
of my children. Notice where he says, Joseph is not. He's dead in his mind. Simeon is not.

00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:34.759
He's in prison in Egypt, right? And ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:45.119
me. You know, Jacob, God was working in his life too. God was working in Jacob's life.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:50.019
Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring them not to thee.

00:36:50.019 --> 00:36:55.039
Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. Now obviously Reuben had

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:58.719
no way of being able to really guarantee that he'd be able to do that, but that's what he

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:03.959
says. In verse 38, he said, My son shall not go down with you. For his brother is dead,

00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:10.039
and he is left alone. If mischief befall him by the way, and the witchy go, then shall

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:17.879
ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Listen, God's working in Jacob's

00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:25.879
life. Jacob needs to learn to trust the Lord. Jacob needs to learn some things about who

00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:32.319
God is and what God is able to do. In fact, as you fast forward through the life of Joseph

00:37:32.319 --> 00:37:37.079
in the next several chapters, you find that it's reported that Joseph is alive. He makes

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:42.559
himself known to his brothers, and that news gets back to Jacob, and Jacob then will journey

00:37:42.559 --> 00:37:47.839
to go into Egypt. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, we understand that God

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:53.679
is working personally in Genesis chapter 42. I wonder this evening, as we look at this

00:37:53.679 --> 00:38:01.939
portion of Scripture and we see the dialogue, we see the account, the events as they unfold

00:38:01.939 --> 00:38:11.259
on this first visit to Egypt. So much more than what these 10 brothers expected. I don't

00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:18.059
think for a moment they were thinking God was going to convict them, deal with them

00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:23.739
in this manner. But I wonder as I look at this portion of Scripture, I'm amazed by the

00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:32.899
sensitivity of them recognizing that God was at work. Think about it this way with me.

00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:38.539
Sometimes we deal with circumstances and situations and we say, well, it's just bad luck, just

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:44.380
misfortune, just this thing happened. You know, these boys, I don't think they were

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:52.940
very close to God, but you know their immediate response? God is at work. What is this that

00:38:52.940 --> 00:39:04.559
God hath done unto us? I wonder tonight, how quick are we to acknowledge God working

00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:10.979
in our lives? When that circumstance, whatever it might be, when this thing happens in your

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:16.219
life and in my life, we know, listen, we know that God is sovereign. We know that God is

00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:24.579
a pursuing God. God is an intimate, personal God. We can stand here and say, I want to

00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:29.139
be right with God. God wants you to be right with Him more than you could ever want to

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:37.820
be right with God. I believe that with all my heart tonight. Draw an eye unto God and

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:46.200
He'll draw an eye unto you. Amen? And I wonder tonight when that thing happens in my life

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.880
and in your life, do we recognize it as being the hand of God? Do we examine our lives and

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.880
say, what is God trying to teach me through this? How is God trying to grow me through

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.000
this?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.559
this? How's God going to use me through this? Or do we just write it off as some kind of

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:07.800
bad misfortune, bad luck, whatever word we want to use to just kind of again continue

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:16.959
to suppress something? You understand what I'm saying tonight? These boys, God is at

00:40:16.959 --> 00:40:25.760
work. What has God done to us? And I just wonder tonight, how's God working in our lives?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:31.759
Do you see God working in your life? Do you hear the voice of God when you read the Bible,

00:40:31.759 --> 00:40:35.919
when you come to church, when you hear the preaching of God's word? Is God working in

00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:44.200
your life? Are there some things that God's putting his finger on? And maybe we don't

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:51.799
like it. Maybe we don't want to deal with it. But God's at work. And God's going to

00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:57.560
continue to pursue. God's going to continue to pursue. And God wants you to not have

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:04.680
a hard heart, but to have a tender heart. He doesn't want us to be hardened, but to

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:12.279
be softened, to be tender. And this evening, as we look at Genesis chapter 42, we see how

00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:18.080
God is working in the life of Joseph, the life of the brothers, the life of Jacob. I

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:24.120
just believe tonight that God's working in our lives as well. And I wonder, are we able

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:30.720
to recognize it? And how do we respond to it? What is God doing? How is God working?

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:38.720
Will we let God be God and have his way? Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:49.319
you for loving us. God, we thank you for this portion of Scripture, for the opportunity

00:41:49.319 --> 00:42:01.239
to see how you're a personal God. Lord, I pray that in the quietness of the moment tonight,

00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:10.520
as we've heard the preaching of your word, as we have a time of invitation even in preparation

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:18.559
for observing the Lord's Supper, God, I pray that you'd help us to examine ourselves. God,

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:31.039
I pray that you'd help us to submit, to surrender to thee. Lord, I don't know how you're working

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:39.479
in everyone's life. I believe that you are at work. And I know at times it's uncomfortable,

00:42:39.479 --> 00:42:49.880
it's difficult. But God, I pray that you'd help us to submit and surrender. God, we would

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:57.679
see and acknowledge that you are at work. Would you have your will and way in these

00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:01.880
moments of invitation? Well, thank you for what you'll do. For it's in Christ's name

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.559
we pray.
