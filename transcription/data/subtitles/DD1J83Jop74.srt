1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,059
and I'm thankful that God has revealed himself to us

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,820
through the pages of scripture.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,460
We think about that song, God's Word Changes Lives,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,500
and we think about the opportunity

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,180
that we have to read the Bible

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,479
and how God has revealed himself to us

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,100
through the pages of scripture.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,780
I've often said this over the years

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,239
and I believe it to be absolutely true,

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,340
the heavens declare the glory of God,

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,120
the firmament showeth forth his handiwork,

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,579
but the reality is that though the heavens declare

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,540
that there is a God, the glory of God,

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,459
the creation cries out that there's a creator,

15
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:38,020
but it's through the written Word of God

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,979
that he has revealed to us his attributes, his character.

17
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:46,360
The fact that what we know about God is found in this book.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
How do you know that God loves you?

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,180
Because he told us in his Word, amen?

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,259
How do you know that he's coming again?

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,740
We sang, coming again, coming again, how do we know?

22
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,659
Because his Word tells us.

23
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,860
And what a joy, we could go on and on

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,259
with all the attributes of God,

25
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,779
but the preacher of yesteryear said this,

26
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,239
to know God is to know his Word.

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,379
To know God is to know his Word.

28
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,000
And I'm so thankful that as we read the scriptures,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
he's given us his attributes,

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,940
and then we understand that he's taught us

31
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,139
of the blessedness of redemption.

32
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,040
Isn't it good to be saved?

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,980
I mean, honestly, what a joy to know Christ as your Savior.

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,819
He is the Savior of the world,

35
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,099
but when you know him as your Savior personally,

36
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,819
we mention often, as you think about that great truth

37
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,580
in Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd.

38
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,019
He is the great shepherd.

39
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,059
He is the chief shepherd, the good shepherd,

40
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,660
but he is my shepherd, and what a joy to know

41
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,339
the blessedness of redemption, of salvation

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,779
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

43
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,620
I find that as we read the Bible,

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,019
that not only does God reveal who he is,

45
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,739
not only does he reveal the plan of redemption,

46
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,819
but I believe that as you study the scriptures,

47
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,980
you will find, you will notice,

48
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,180
that God has graciously blessed us

49
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,459
with instruction for godly living.

50
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,179
As you read the Bible, it's abundantly clear and obvious

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,119
that God is concerned with how we live our lives.

52
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,660
Our conduct, our behavior is important to God.

53
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,139
The reality is that I would argue

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,619
that these portions of scripture

55
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,539
that teach us of godly living

56
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,699
are just as important as those portions of scripture

57
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,860
that reveal to us the attributes of our God.

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,779
Amen?

59
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,779
They're equally important.

60
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,100
They're a blessing.

61
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,740
I shared with somebody on Wednesday evening

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,899
in the foyer there at the end of the service,

63
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,619
they were asking a question, and I said,

64
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,460
I'm just so thankful that God has given us instruction

65
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,500
for godly living in his word,

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,779
and wouldn't it be a sad thing

67
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,820
if you were being disobedient to God,

68
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,179
you didn't even know you were being disobedient to God

69
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,179
because he didn't tell you in his word

70
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,940
what he expected of you,

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,779
and then you were held accountable for it.

72
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,199
That'd be unfortunate.

73
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,300
But God has been gracious to give us instruction

74
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,440
for godly living.

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,059
He's told us some things that don't please him.

76
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,300
He's told us some things that please him,

77
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,539
and that is wonderful.

78
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,860
Listen, all scripture, the Bible says,

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,300
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

80
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,899
That's John 3, 16,

81
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,139
as much as it is any other verse of scripture,

82
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,220
because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,380
It is not valid that we would take

84
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,460
certain portions of the word of God and say,

85
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,960
well, I'm gonna accept this,

86
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,460
and I'm gonna cherish these verses,

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,559
but these ones over here,

88
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,300
well, I'm gonna just discard those.

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not interested in those.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,300
We're missing out because God's given us all of it,

91
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,860
and the Bible says that not only has it been given by God,

92
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,899
but it's profitable.

93
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,699
It's profitable for doctrine,

94
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,500
for what we believe, for reproof, for correction.

95
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,339
Listen, there are times in which the word of God

96
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,300
has to correct us.

97
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,440
It has to reprove us, and we ought to be thankful for that.

98
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,000
When the word of God steps on our toes, amen,

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,259
and it is God's word that reproves, and it corrects,

100
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:09,759
and it says for instruction in righteousness,

101
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,899
that the man of God may be perfect,

102
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:14,660
throughly furnished unto all good works.

103
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,820
And I'm thankful for all portions of God's word,

104
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,980
the preacher said this with regard to those that would say,

105
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,420
well, I'm not sure about that verse.

106
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,380
I don't really think that's what that means,

107
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,660
or I really don't think we have to abide by that

108
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,779
or follow that.

109
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:31,059
He would take out a marker or a pen knife and say,

110
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,119
okay, take this and blot it out in your Bible,

111
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,619
or cut it out of your Bible.

112
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:38,119
And they would say, I'm not gonna do that.

113
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,679
Well, you might as well, right?

114
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,579
But we'd never wanna cut up our Bibles

115
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,420
or mark out our Bibles,

116
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,559
but if we're not gonna live by it,

117
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,459
if we're not gonna take the instruction,

118
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,000
we might as well just do that,

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,119
because really that's what we're doing anyway.

120
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,660
And so as we think about the word of God,

121
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,640
as we look at this portion of scripture,

122
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,959
I've titled the message, Walk in Wisdom.

123
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,559
As we examine these couple of verses of scripture,

124
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,660
I want you to, if you're taking notes,

125
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,160
number one, consider the importance of your testimony.

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,440
Notice Colossians four and verse number five.

127
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,359
The Bible says, walk in wisdom

128
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,399
toward them that are without.

129
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,720
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,679
Redeeming the time, let your speech be always with grace,

131
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,679
seasoned with salt, that you may know

132
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,380
how you ought to answer every man.

133
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,239
Number one, consider the importance of your testimony.

134
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,660
We find here that the scripture starts

135
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,619
with these three words, walk in wisdom,

136
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:39,239
literally to behave ourselves wisely.

137
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,880
We understand that Jesus said this in Matthew 10

138
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,440
and verse number 16, be you therefore wise as serpents

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,640
and harmless as doves.

140
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,279
We are to walk in wisdom, and we find that it's important,

141
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,420
it's imperative that we understand

142
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,559
that we're to behave ourselves wisely,

143
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,600
that as we conduct ourselves,

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,040
when we think about our behavior,

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,559
that it would be that which is wise,

146
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,760
that which is appropriate.

147
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,000
We find that if we lack wisdom,

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,880
God tells us that he has all wisdom,

149
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,440
and he says that if we but ask for wisdom,

150
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,160
that he would give it to us.

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
And what a blessing when we think about walking in wisdom

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,000
and behaving ourselves wisely.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm mindful as we think about this truth,

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,079
this instruction that is given to us

155
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,600
with the importance of our testimony,

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm mindful of what the Bible says of David.

157
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,220
Hold your hand here and turn to the book of 1 Samuel,

158
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,059
if you will, and I want you to notice in chapter number 18,

159
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,019
we know that it was in chapter number 16 of 1 Samuel,

160
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,899
where God had anointed through Samuel,

161
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,859
David to be the next king of Israel.

162
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,820
He had a rejected Saul because of his disobedience,

163
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,579
and David had been anointed in chapter number 16.

164
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,959
It's in chapter number 17 of the book of 1 Samuel

165
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,339
that God provides us with the record of David and Goliath.

166
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,899
And then we come to the 18th chapter

167
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,579
of the book of 1 Samuel,

168
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,579
we begin to read some things about the behavior of David

169
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,220
that I wanna highlight to you here this morning,

170
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,940
when we think about this truth,

171
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,079
walk in wisdom to behave ourselves wisely.

172
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,679
In 1 Samuel 18, notice in verse number five,

173
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,519
the Bible says,

174
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,160
and David went out whithersoever Saul sent him

175
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,000
and behaved himself wisely.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,959
And Saul set him over the men of war

177
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,359
and he was accepted in the sight of all the people

178
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,720
and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

179
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,559
Skip down to verse number 14.

180
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,959
Notice again, the Bible says,

181
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,959
and David behaved himself wisely in all his ways

182
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,260
and the Lord was with him.

183
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,899
It's interesting to me that the verse of Scripture

184
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,079
ends with the statement that the Lord was with him.

185
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,679
And we find that this is revealed to us

186
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,260
in a number of people's lives in the Old Testament,

187
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,200
how God is with them and causes them to prosper

188
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,399
and so on and so forth.

189
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,720
But we find that David's behavior

190
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,959
and that he behaved himself wisely in all his ways

191
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,760
is a key factor that helps us understand

192
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,519
why God was with him.

193
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,480
Amen?

194
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,920
We understand as New Testament believers

195
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,399
that we are indwelled by the Spirit of God.

196
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,100
And what a blessing to understand the indwelling

197
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,200
of the Holy Spirit.

198
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,359
It is the earnest of our salvation.

199
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:19,279
And we find that we are sealed under the day of redemption.

200
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,640
And what a joy and what a blessing that is.

201
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,799
He says, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

202
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:27,200
But you understand as New Testament believers

203
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,040
that we can quench and grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

204
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,919
We can behave ourselves in manners

205
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,919
in which are not pleasing to God.

206
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,760
And we find that in those times of quenching

207
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,619
and grieving the Spirit of God,

208
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,080
it's not that he departs from us,

209
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,479
but it is not as obvious that he is with us.

210
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,119
Does that make sense to you this morning?

211
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,900
And we find here that the Bible says

212
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,900
that David behaved himself wisely in all his ways

213
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,200
and the Lord was with him.

214
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,119
Notice how the passage of Scripture ends

215
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,960
in 1 Samuel 18 and verse number 30.

216
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,880
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,359
and it came to pass after they went forth

218
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:11,039
that David behaved himself more wisely

219
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,400
than all the servants of Saul

220
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,940
so that his name was much set by.

221
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,539
That phrase at the end of verse number 30

222
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,479
means that it was held in high regard and high esteem.

223
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,479
And we find that the Bible tells us here

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,960
that he behaved himself more wisely

225
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
than all the servants of Saul.

226
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,039
God tells us in Colossians chapter number four

227
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,679
and verse number five, walk in wisdom.

228
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,919
But I want you to notice that it says

229
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,520
walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

230
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,679
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

231
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,099
What is the instruction?

232
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,919
What is it that Paul is giving the instruction

233
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,919
to these believers in Colossae?

234
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,280
He's saying this, he's saying walk in wisdom

235
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,960
toward the unbelievers, toward them that are without.

236
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,359
That when we would understand

237
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,819
understand our conduct and our behavior,

238
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,159
that we would understand,

239
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,879
as someone of yesteryear said,

240
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,919
that sometimes your life might be

241
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,059
the only Bible that some lost person

242
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,919
ever reads or ever observes,

243
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,079
and the reality is that there are people

244
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,619
that are watching us.

245
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,619
We don't even know who those people are.

246
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,979
Who is observing you?

247
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,279
And let me ask this,

248
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,199
what is it that they're observing?

249
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,439
Are we walking in wisdom toward them

250
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,119
that are without understanding

251
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,879
that there are people that we come in contact with

252
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,139
that God has given us the opportunity

253
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,079
to show the Lord Jesus Christ,

254
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,319
and in our lives that he, Jesus,

255
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,979
would be exalted and magnified,

256
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,919
that we'd say, as John the Baptist said,

257
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,219
he must increase and I must decrease,

258
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,839
that as our lives,

259
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,059
as we find in Matthew chapter number five,

260
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:46,899
when Jesus says,

261
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,739
let your light so shine before men

262
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:51,559
that they may see your good works

263
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,039
and what, glorify your Father,

264
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,399
which is in heaven.

265
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,679
And what a joy to understand that

266
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,759
as we look at this couple of verses of scripture,

267
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,039
it begins with this instruction

268
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,419
of reminding us the importance of your testimony.

269
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,359
There are people that are watching us,

270
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,679
that are observing us.

271
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,119
I did not take the time,

272
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,719
but if you jot down in your notes,

273
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,279
first Samuel 16 and verse number 18,

274
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,399
it's a powerful verse of scripture.

275
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,239
I'm not even,

276
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,799
I just wanna make sure I'm giving you the right reference.

277
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,979
First Samuel 16 and verse number 18,

278
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:24,399
that there's an unnamed servant of Saul

279
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,239
that observes David

280
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:29,239
and gives this great recommendation

281
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,059
of David being the one that is selected

282
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,879
to come into the house of Saul

283
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,719
and to play with that evil spirit

284
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,159
that troubled him.

285
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,199
We find that there are people that are observing you.

286
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,399
What would they say of you?

287
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,759
What would they say of me?

288
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,099
The instruction to the believers in Colossae

289
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,359
is to be mindful of

290
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:53,159
and to understand the importance of their testimony,

291
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,999
to walk in wisdom toward them

292
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,399
that are without,

293
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,439
that we would not behave ourselves foolishly,

294
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,079
that we would not behave ourselves

295
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,879
in a manner in which it would bring a reproach

296
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,339
against the name of God,

297
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,039
that we'd understand our testimony.

298
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,479
We often say,

299
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,679
as we would think about our own children,

300
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,319
that they represent our family,

301
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,479
but they also represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

302
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,419
When we have teen activities

303
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,279
and we're taking teenagers on trips

304
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,159
to teen camp or to some other activity,

305
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,359
we'll say to the teenagers something like this.

306
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,879
Remember that you represent Fellowship Baptist Church,

307
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,799
but more importantly,

308
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,839
you represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

309
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,839
That we'd be mindful

310
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,159
that we would consider the importance of our testimony.

311
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,399
There are people that are observing us.

312
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,359
There's some people that are watching you.

313
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,959
You don't even know that they're watching you.

314
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,239
He says that we are to walk in wisdom

315
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:50,559
toward them that are without.

316
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,759
Notice the end of verse number five,

317
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,879
redeeming the time.

318
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,119
Not only should we consider

319
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,519
the importance of our testimony,

320
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,879
but I believe number two,

321
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,079
you should consider the investment of your time.

322
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,719
The investment of your time.

323
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,319
He says redeeming the time.

324
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,299
You know, time is something that's very interesting.

325
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,019
Time is a gift from God.

326
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,959
It really is.

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,579
Life, breath, time.

328
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,319
It's a gift from God.

329
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,199
I would say this,

330
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,599
that time is a precious commodity.

331
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,239
Let me say this,

332
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,039
if you waste your money,

333
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,239
that can be folly and that can be unfortunate,

334
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,399
but you can regain it.

335
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,279
If you waste your time,

336
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,759
it is gone forever.

337
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,039
Right?

338
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,479
You can waste money.

339
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,839
You can lose money.

340
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,099
You can make a foolish investment of money.

341
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,839
And perhaps you can recover from that foolish investment.

342
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,319
Perhaps you can recover from that wasteful spending

343
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,959
and you can kind of get back on track

344
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,039
and so on and so forth.

345
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,819
But when you waste time,

346
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,079
it's gone.

347
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,359
You can't get it back.

348
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,519
Listen, if I wasted an hour yesterday,

349
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,159
I can't regain it today.

350
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,139
It's gone.

351
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,679
I can't take an hour today and say,

352
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,919
I'm gonna store this up for tomorrow.

353
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,999
Just doesn't work that way.

354
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,839
Time is a precious commodity.

355
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,879
Let me say this,

356
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,359
there's not one of us in our room today

357
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,699
that's on this property today,

358
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,099
that's tuned in via live stream today,

359
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,679
that has any idea of how much time they have left.

360
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,979
Not one of us.

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,599
We think that we make plans considering the future

362
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,919
and considering future things and what have you.

363
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,079
And if you look at calendars as you fill up your schedule

364
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,439
for days and weeks and perhaps months in advance,

365
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,319
I have people that are scheduled to come here

366
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,279
to our church for missions conferences

367
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,519
and for revival meetings for two, three years from now

368
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,879
that are scheduled out.

369
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,000
But the reality is that they don't know

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,839
and I don't know if we're even gonna be here still.

371
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,099
Amen?

372
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,039
And so when we think about time

373
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,699
and we think about this simple statement

374
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,759
that is made redeeming the time,

375
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,039
we must consider the investment of our time.

376
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,000
We must understand that it's important

377
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,719
that we use our time wisely,

378
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,439
that we seize the opportunities that God gives us.

379
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,619
The idea of this phraseology of redeeming the time

380
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:21,119
is to use it wisely, to understand the preciousness of time

381
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,000
and to use it appropriately.

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,739
If you were to do the calculations,

383
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,279
you would understand that, of course,

384
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,279
each day we have 24 hours, we have 1,440 minutes per day.

385
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:36,759
86,400 seconds per day.

386
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,519
Now obviously there's some time in there

387
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,239
that we need to sleep and we understand that.

388
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:44,559
And by the way, God created us that we need sleep

389
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,500
and that's just part of what it is.

390
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,199
Now we're not to love sleep.

391
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,079
Proverbs warns us about that.

392
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,239
But the reality is that we need sleep.

393
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,799
But there are portions of our day that we get

394
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,559
that we have to look at maybe in that manner.

395
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,379
Maybe we break it down by the minutes.

396
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,359
I have 1,440 minutes today, how am I gonna use those?

397
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,199
I have 86,400 seconds today, how am I gonna use those?

398
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,039
What if it was, Brother Ron, if I came to you today

399
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,399
and said, here's $1,440, use it wisely?

400
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,319
At the end of the day, it's gone though.

401
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,839
Tomorrow you're gonna get another $1,440

402
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,839
but you can't save it for the next day.

403
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,799
You gotta use it and you gotta use it wisely.

404
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,099
And we would really consider how we use that money.

405
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,439
Would we not?

406
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:36,239
And we'd really work hard to use all of it

407
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,519
because it's gonna be gone at the end of the day, right?

408
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
We say, I just have this $1,440 to just use today.

409
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,699
It's for today, this is all I have.

410
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,879
I'm gonna get another $1,440 tomorrow

411
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,519
but I'm gonna be careful how I spend it.

412
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,879
I'm gonna try to spend it wisely.

413
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,159
I'm gonna try to use it to its fullest ability.

414
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,559
What about our time?

415
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,119
What about our minutes?

416
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,759
What about the seconds that God gives us?

417
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,319
Time is precious, it is a precious commodity.

418
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,359
And we understand that we have to invest our time wisely,

419
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,119
redeeming the time.

420
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,799
Proverbs 27 in verse number one,

421
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,159
the wise man gives us insight.

422
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,859
Listen, the reality is that we know

423
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,599
that our days are numbered

424
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,959
and we understand that we just have a certain amount

425
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,479
of time here on this earth.

426
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,039
As it is appointed unto man wants to die

427
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,500
after this the judgment.

428
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,079
That's what God says in his word, right?

429
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,399
There's a time in which we're gonna die.

430
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:36,479
It's interesting to me how hard

431
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:40,959
and how just in these last several months,

432
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,119
this last couple of years,

433
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,299
how people have tried to preserve life.

434
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,379
They've tried so hard to preserve life

435
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:55,319
but in so doing they stopped living life, right?

436
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,000
We're working to preserve life but we stopped living life.

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,119
I read an interesting article last week

438
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,839
of the Amish folks up in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

439
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,439
They were the first group of people

440
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:13,079
that were acknowledged of having herd immunity from COVID.

441
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,959
And you know one of the things they said?

442
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,599
We just couldn't stop living.

443
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,159
We weren't gonna let our loved ones die in a hospital

444
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,079
without being able to see them.

445
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,959
We weren't gonna stop gathering as a church.

446
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,199
We weren't gonna stop, that's what they said.

447
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,359
And they had fewer deaths than a lot of other people did.

448
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,839
I'm not trying to get into some hot debate situation

449
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,559
this morning but simply what I'm saying

450
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,000
is that we have time.

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,919
We've tried to preserve our lives

452
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,679
but in so doing we stopped living our lives.

453
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,200
And we don't know how much time we have.

454
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
We really don't.

455
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,779
We can read every day in the news.

456
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,880
In fact, I read two weeks ago

457
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
how the automobile casualties have increased 15 to 20%

458
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,119
in the last six months.

459
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,159
I didn't read the whole article

460
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,440
but I read this morning that in all 50 states of America

461
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,399
people are drinking contaminated water.

462
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,200
What, are we gonna stop drinking?

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,760
No, we can't, right?

464
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,099
And so the reality is that we have to use wisdom.

465
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,339
We walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

466
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,719
We understand this thing of investing our time

467
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,619
and that God has given us time.

468
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,399
It's a precious commodity.

469
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,359
And notice what Proverbs 27 says.

470
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,399
Boast not thyself of tomorrow

471
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:33,000
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

472
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,719
We don't know what's on tomorrow.

473
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,679
So many people wanna talk about how many people

474
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,299
have died from COVID in the last 18 months

475
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,760
and I understand it's tragic, it's unfortunate

476
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,519
but the reality is that there are tens of millions of people

477
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,159
that have died from other things.

478
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,579
Because every day people are dying.

479
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,959
People are dying.

480
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:58,239
Every day.

481
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,479
Life is precious.

482
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,879
It is precious.

483
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:07,599
James chapter number 4, verses 13 and 14,

484
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,919
Go to now ye that say, today or tomorrow

485
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,799
we will go into such a city,

486
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,919
and continue there a year,

487
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,639
and buy and sell and get gain.

488
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:19,959
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow.

489
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,199
And then this question for what is your life?

490
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,839
What is your life?

491
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,199
Is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time

492
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,279
and then vanisheth away.

493
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,119
How long is that little time?

494
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,879
We don't know.

495
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,479
But if we took a field trip this morning

496
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,719
to the closest cemetery,

497
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,759
you'd find that there are people that died

498
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,159
at just hours old,

499
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,799
and there are people that died at over 100.

500
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,919
Correct?

501
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,159
What is your life?

502
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,359
Our time, the investment of our time.

503
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,399
We understand the importance of our testimony.

504
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,239
He says, walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

505
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,679
He then says that we're to consider

506
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,359
the investment of our time,

507
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,119
that we're to redeem the time,

508
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,199
understanding that it is a precious commodity,

509
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,839
it is a gift from God,

510
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,479
and it's a little vapor.

511
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,759
It's just a vapor that appeareth for a little time

512
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,759
and then vanisheth away.

513
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,439
The Psalms talk about our life being like a shadow.

514
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:25,359
We find that Psalm 90 that's attributed to Moses,

515
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,079
when he talks about our life being threescore and ten,

516
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,799
or by reason of strength, fourscore years.

517
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,239
And we think about that reference.

518
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,279
So teach us to number our days

519
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,359
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

520
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,319
But we find just previous to that text of Scripture,

521
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,639
a few verses before,

522
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,799
he says that we live our life as a tale that is told.

523
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,519
Man, according to Ecclesiastes 12,

524
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,999
goes to his long home.

525
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,999
Man goes to his long home.

526
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,279
And we understand eternity

527
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,159
and how it's so precious and so joyful

528
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,879
for us to know the reality of heaven

529
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,239
and to understand Christ as our Savior.

530
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,439
But we understand that until we hear that trumpet sound

531
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,279
or until we take that last breath here upon earth,

532
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,399
and none of us know the time in which that will happen,

533
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,519
we have this moment to live life,

534
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,399
to invest our time.

535
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,439
We consider the importance of our testimony.

536
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,519
We consider the investment of our time.

537
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,519
Why is it so important?

538
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,159
Because once it's gone, it's gone.

539
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,479
It's gone.

540
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,999
Never to be captured back again.

541
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:34,999
Notice as we move on to verse number six

542
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,759
back in Colossians 4,

543
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,119
not only the importance of our testimony,

544
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,319
the investment of our time,

545
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,639
but I want you to notice in verse number six,

546
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,439
the Bible says,

547
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:50,959
let your speech be always with grace,

548
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,879
seasoned with salt,

549
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:57,199
that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

550
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:01,559
Consider finally this morning the impact of your tongue.

551
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,559
The impact of your tongue.

552
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,999
We notice the importance of our testimony,

553
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:06,159
the investment of our time,

554
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,119
and we see here finally in verse number six

555
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,639
the impact of our tongue.

556
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,679
The book of James speaks much about the tongue.

557
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,119
We will not take time this morning

558
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,599
to go to those passages of Scripture,

559
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,799
but we understand that it's a little member.

560
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,879
It can cause all kinds of problems, right?

561
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,399
And we need to consider the impact of our tongue.

562
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,319
You know that your tongue, there's power in your speech.

563
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,039
There's power in your tongue.

564
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:35,039
You can build up or you can bring down through our speech.

565
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,879
In verse number six,

566
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,399
we find that previous in chapter number three,

567
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,999
he had spoken about communication.

568
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,959
He talked about putting off those things

569
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,199
in chapter number three.

570
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,399
And we mentioned as you go to the book of Ephesians

571
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,439
and you find reference with regard to our speech,

572
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,839
but throughout the word of God,

573
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,519
there are many things in which God gives us

574
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,679
with regard to our speech.

575
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,399
But we notice here that he says,

576
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,079
let your speech, notice what he says, be always.

577
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,919
I like the fact that he says always

578
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,559
because there are no exceptions.

579
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,159
We like exceptions, don't we?

580
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,319
But do you know what they said to me?

581
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,119
You ask a little kid, why did you do that?

582
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,639
Well, I did that because they did this.

583
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,479
Why did you say that?

584
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,879
Well, I said this because they said that.

585
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:19,879
But as God's people, he says,

586
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:24,879
let your speech be always with grace.

587
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,159
No exceptions, no wiggle room.

588
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,399
Have you ever had somebody speak to you

589
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,199
in a manner in which you kind of feel like,

590
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,919
all right, the gloves are coming out, right?

591
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,439
We can do this.

592
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,679
But as a child of God,

593
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,599
I feel like at times I can tell you

594
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,679
there are times that I have been in situations

595
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,599
in which I know the person I've been talking to

596
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,599
was trying to berate me in such a way

597
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,479
so that I would speak back in like fashion.

598
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,719
I know it.

599
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,359
I could give you illustrations, I won't bore you.

600
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:01,159
But the reality is that as a child of God,

601
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,319
we are told that we are to understand

602
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,999
and consider the impact of our tongue

603
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,199
to let your speech be always with grace.

604
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,039
I would say this,

605
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,799
notice back in chapter number three in verse number 16,

606
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,439
if we have grace in our hearts,

607
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,159
then we'll have grace in our speech.

608
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,839
Notice what he says in Colossians 3 in verse number 16.

609
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,319
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,

610
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,239
teaching and admonishing one another

611
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,559
in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

612
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,399
singing how with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

613
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,039
As the word of Christ is dwelling in us richly

614
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,759
in all wisdom, how important verse number 16

615
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,679
of Colossians 3 is to verses five and six.

616
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,359
By the way, as you study the entirety

617
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,439
of the book of Colossians as we have this calendar year

618
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:49,159
in building one message upon another message,

619
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:52,919
you understand how the truth of chapter number three,

620
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,719
as we mentioned the put off and put on principles

621
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,599
and we spent weeks dealing with that

622
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,999
and how that then results itself

623
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,799
in the behavior in church, the behavior in our home,

624
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,319
the behavior in the workplace,

625
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,039
and we find even now as we continue to receive

626
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,199
these words of instruction as we conclude

627
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:11,439
this final chapter of the book of Colossians

628
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:15,039
that when I've taken the instruction of chapter number three

629
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,239
and properly applied it in my heart and my life,

630
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,079
then I'm able to walk in wisdom

631
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,119
toward them that are without.

632
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,639
I'm able to redeem the time.

633
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:26,279
I'm able to let my speech be always with grace,

634
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,239
seasoned with salt.

635
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,639
In fact, it's interesting as we think about our speech

636
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,639
being always with grace in Luke 4 in verse 22,

637
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,399
it says, and all bear him witness

638
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,159
speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ

639
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,879
and wondered at the gracious words

640
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:47,039
which proceeded out of his mouth.

641
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,159
Seasoned with salt, the Bible says.

642
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,319
I believe that as we look at this phraseology,

643
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,919
we think about our speech

644
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,479
and oftentimes we think about seasoning with salt,

645
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,679
we think about cooking, do we not?

646
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,799
And we think about the importance of using some salt

647
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,459
in our cooking as we would prepare meals

648
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,439
and so on and so forth,

649
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,559
but here the word of God says

650
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
that we're to season our speech,

651
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,119
that our speech is to be always with grace,

652
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,039
seasoned with salt.

653
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,759
It's kind of interesting as we would understand

654
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,039
this phraseology and it carries with it

655
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,999
the idea of that which is appropriate,

656
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:29,159
that which is pure, that which is God honoring.

657
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,559
We understand that salt preserves

658
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,199
and we do not use it in such a manner

659
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,139
as much today as they did years ago

660
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:38,779
or even in biblical times,

661
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,739
but we find that when he speaks about our speech

662
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,259
being seasoned with salt,

663
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,699
it's that which is appropriate,

664
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,359
that which is pure, that which is God honoring.

665
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,359
It's interesting in our bulletin today,

666
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,019
we have there on the right hand of the page

667
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:53,459
in everything give thanks.

668
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:55,219
First Thessalonians 5 in verse 18,

669
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:56,679
it's the month of November

670
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,899
and of course we have on our calendar

671
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,799
Thanksgiving in the month of November,

672
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,999
but the reality is that as the people of God,

673
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:07,459
we don't just reserve thankfulness for November.

674
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,519
Set to a Thursday in November even more specifically.

675
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,219
No, we're to be thankful always, correct?

676
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,219
We think about this truth when it says

677
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:19,819
let your speech be always with grace,

678
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,139
seasoned with salt, that which is appropriate,

679
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:24,319
pure, God honoring.

680
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,599
I would say this, that we're living in a time,

681
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,459
we're living in the midst of a time

682
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,639
in which there's this spirit of complaining.

683
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,579
This spirit of complaining.

684
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:37,940
God tells us that this would be the case

685
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,539
for in 2 Timothy 3 when he speaks about

686
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,000
the way in which the last times,

687
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,219
the perilous times that we're living in

688
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,099
would be described, he says at the end of verse number two,

689
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,940
unthankful and unholy.

690
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,179
We're living in a time in which there seems to be

691
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,260
this increased amount of a spirit of complaining

692
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,739
and then all of a sudden I go back to the word of God

693
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,099
and I say actually this thing of complaining

694
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,099
and murmuring has always been part of human nature.

695
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:08,239
When you look back into the Old Testament

696
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,559
and you look at the children of Israel,

697
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,199
they're always murmuring and complaining.

698
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:14,119
I would ask you this morning as we think about

699
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,199
the spirit of complaining, I would ask you this morning

700
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:20,919
is that appropriate, is that pure, is that God honoring?

701
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,739
You know when we complain about our circumstances,

702
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
we're really calling God onto the stage so to speak

703
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,219
because he's done something wrong.

704
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:37,219
But God never does anything wrong, correct?

705
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,219
And we think about when Moses on a number of occasions

706
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,959
when the people would complain, what do you say?

707
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,019
You're not complaining against me,

708
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,339
you're complaining against God.

709
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,779
You're complaining against God.

710
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,779
And this spirit of complaining I believe

711
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,299
that it's something that is so prevalent

712
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,380
in our society today, something that has influenced

713
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,179
and impacted and it's unfortunate

714
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,039
because as the people of God.

715
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,499
God, our speech is to be always with grace, seasoned with salt.

716
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:14,159
If we're complaining and murmuring, how that displeases God.

717
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,919
How that disappoints our Savior.

718
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,479
For He's good all the time, is He not?

719
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:24,519
We say something like this, it's certainly more than a cliché, but we'll make the statement

720
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,439
God is good, and then we'll say all the time, and then somebody else might say all the time

721
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,619
God is good.

722
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:38,679
But if we're complaining, are we really saying that God is good?

723
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:40,119
God is good all the time?

724
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,359
I would say this, it's easy to complain, it really is.

725
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,759
It's a lot harder to be thankful, it is.

726
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,879
It's easy to complain about circumstances and situations.

727
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:58,359
In fact, I will be very transparent with you this morning, I had to confess to God to this,

728
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,199
I was complaining about complaining.

729
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,399
If I could share with you a little bit of the complaints that I get on a regular basis,

730
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,319
you'd go nuts.

731
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,279
And I found myself complaining about complaining.

732
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:23,399
And God smoked my heart and said, stop it, give thanks, sorry Lord.

733
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,359
Being transparent, it's easy to complain.

734
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,519
But oh, how our speech is to be with grace and seasoned with salt, that which is appropriate,

735
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,759
that which is pure, that which is God-honoring.

736
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,399
It's interesting as we think about salt preserving, but I would also say this, have you ever had

737
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,919
something that was super salty, like it was too heavy-handed on the salt?

738
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,959
A meal, y'all are laughing, sometimes, right, you get too much salt.

739
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,839
What happens when you have too much salt?

740
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,359
Well, you can swell up, but what else happens?

741
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,319
You need something to drink, you're thirsty, right?

742
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,879
You need something to drink.

743
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:02,679
So I think about this when I look at this phrase where it says seasoned with salt, and

744
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,879
especially as we look at the latter part of verse number six, it seems to be indicative

745
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:13,719
of this being part of the interpretation or the application at least, not only does salt

746
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:18,919
preserve and our speech needs to be that which is appropriate, pure, and God-honoring, but

747
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,359
salt also makes thirsty.

748
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,919
And so I wonder this morning is our speech in such a way in which it would make people

749
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:33,199
want more, that they would be thirsty, that they would be thirsty for truth.

750
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:39,319
Listen, we're living in a time in which there's a famine of truth.

751
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,799
There's a famine of truth.

752
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:47,079
And can I tell you this morning that we can use our speech in such a way that as we're

753
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:50,879
speaking, not only honoring God, not only that which is appropriate and that which is

754
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:56,599
pleasing and pure, but also that we can use our speech in such a way that people that

755
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,159
hear us are going to say, I want to know more about that.

756
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,159
That's just different.

757
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,479
I haven't heard that before.

758
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:05,999
I use the illustration many times over the years.

759
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:11,879
My dad used the illustration last year when he preached in January after I had that operation.

760
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:17,199
But the reality is that there was a man that was witnessing the day that my dad walked

761
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:22,159
through the shop in which he was working down at Camp Geiger in North Carolina.

762
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,399
And as he was walking past that place where those men were there sorting brass ammunition

763
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:32,279
at the School of Infantry, we find that this man was a Christian and he was speaking to

764
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,319
the other man and he said this, there are a lot of dead people in the world that are

765
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,359
just waiting to die.

766
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,279
That was speech that had salt.

767
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,319
You know why?

768
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,639
It stopped my dad in his tracks who was lost.

769
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:49,839
And he said, what does that mean?

770
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,839
That's salt.

771
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,839
I want more.

772
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,439
I want to understand that.

773
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,719
What does that mean?

774
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:01,399
He said, well, what it means is that there are a lot of people that are dead spiritually

775
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,519
that are just waiting to die a physical death.

776
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,959
And at that moment, my dad, he would tell you, he's watching this morning, he would

777
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,959
tell you, that's me.

778
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:17,119
I'm dead spiritually, but I'm waiting to die a physical death.

779
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,079
So on that day, I don't know what day it was, but on that day, you know what happened?

780
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,119
My dad came home and he said, we're going to church on Sunday.

781
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,799
We're doing what?

782
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,759
It wasn't Christmas and Easter and actually for the number of years, it didn't matter

783
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:32,759
if it was Christmas and Easter.

784
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:33,759
We didn't go to church anyway.

785
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:34,759
Seriously.

786
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:35,759
He said, we're going to church.

787
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:40,359
What do you mean we're going to church?

788
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:42,759
It was speech with salt.

789
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,659
He needed to find out.

790
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,519
He wanted more.

791
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,079
He went to church and got nothing.

792
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,679
The liberal church didn't preach the gospel.

793
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,999
He went back to that Marine and said, what church do you go to?

794
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,399
Because that's where I need to go.

795
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:03,679
And he went to Grace Baptist Church in Jacksonville, North Carolina and got saved.

796
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,719
Because somebody had speech that had salt.

797
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,279
It was seasoned with salt.

798
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,279
Here's a man that came here.

799
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:13,679
He was working during the project, the parsonage, and he was here and he was doing some surveying.

800
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,639
And I spoke with this man and I shared some truth with him.

801
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,919
And then I just kind of left him.

802
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:22,999
Just asked him some questions, tried to use speech that was seasoned with salt to make

803
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:25,079
him want more.

804
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,759
Here's a problem that I have often.

805
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:31,599
I just back up the truckload of truth and just dump it on somebody.

806
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,639
You ever feel like you do that?

807
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,479
And I'm working actively in my life to stop doing that.

808
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:38,479
Why?

809
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:42,319
Because I want to use speech that's seasoned with salt that I want to know if they're truly

810
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:46,519
interested in knowing more.

811
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,959
The man came back several weeks later to work on another surveying issue that he was working

812
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,279
on.

813
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,279
And I walked outside.

814
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,159
I saw that it was the same guy and I said, hey man, how are you?

815
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,159
Good to see you.

816
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,319
I said, did you think about what I asked you?

817
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,479
I can't stop thinking about it.

818
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:06,279
I need an answer.

819
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,279
I need an answer.

820
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,079
He's a Muslim.

821
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,079
And you know what I asked him?

822
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,639
Who's his lamb?

823
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,639
God provided a lamb for Abraham.

824
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,599
Moses had a lamb.

825
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,599
Who's your lamb?

826
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,799
That's all I asked him.

827
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:25,239
Do you have a lamb?

828
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,199
So for weeks he thinks about this.

829
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,079
He talks to his wife about it.

830
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,079
He comes back.

831
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,079
I said, do you have an answer?

832
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,079
He said, no.

833
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,439
He said, I can't stop thinking about this.

834
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,439
What do you mean do I have a lamb?

835
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,439
That's what he says.

836
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:42,439
That's all right.

837
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:45,119
I'll let you get to your work.

838
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,119
Have a good day.

839
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,239
He said, no, no, no.

840
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,239
You need to tell me.

841
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,479
That's what he says.

842
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:52,999
I'm trying to walk back to the church and he's like, Colin, no, no, no.

843
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,559
And here's what he tells me.

844
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,679
He said, it is your job to tell me.

845
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,639
That's what he told me.

846
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,559
He wanted truth.

847
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,919
He said, what is this lamb?

848
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,439
Is it my works?

849
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:18,559
I said, sir, it's not a what, it's a who.

850
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:26,119
John the Baptist says, behold, the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.

851
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,999
I wish that guy got saved in the parking lot.

852
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:31,679
He didn't, but he's wanting more.

853
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,879
He's wanting more.

854
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:41,639
I wonder when we look at a simple couple of verses of instruction in Colossians 4, 5,

855
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,139
and 6, are we mindful of the impact of our tongue?

856
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,519
Not only that our speech would be always with grace, seasoned with salt, not only that which

857
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:56,559
is appropriate and pure, but that which would cause people to want more.

858
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,159
That we would learn to speak in the manner in which Jesus spoke.

859
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:08,639
You know, many times as you read the Gospels, you'll find that Jesus asked questions.

860
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,559
He asked questions.

861
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,759
And he would ask questions to see the interest of individuals as they would respond.

862
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:22,479
He would leave statements and he would ask questions that would be speech seasoned with

863
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:29,119
salt to cause people to want to hear more, to know more.

864
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,639
And I believe that it's a truth of application here because it says at the end of verse number

865
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:45,159
6, notice what it says, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

866
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:51,239
So if my speech is seasoned with salt, not only that which is appropriate and pure and

867
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:57,519
God-honoring, but it's that which would provoke someone to want to know more, someone that

868
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:04,279
is thirsty, someone that's asking questions, I find that to be a proper application here

869
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:08,940
because he ends the verse by saying that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

870
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,719
Why are they asking questions?

871
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:16,880
Because I've used speech that's salty, that causes them to want more, to inquire, and

872
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,239
to desire, to know what it is that we're speaking about.

873
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,479
And when you make statements, when you speak about as you would consider your testimony,

874
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:29,159
the importance of your testimony, walking in wisdom toward them that are without, when

875
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,119
you speak on a daily basis within those that you work with and those that you live around

876
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,559
and those that are your family and you speak in such a way that people say, I don't have

877
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,559
that peace.

878
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,039
I don't have that confidence.

879
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,639
I don't have that certainty.

880
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,839
How is it that you are so confident?

881
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,320
How is it that you have this peace?

882
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,500
It's not my peace, it's God's peace.

883
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,320
It's not my confidence, it's the confidence that God gives me through His Word.

884
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,000
And as those questions come...

885
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,339
We've used speech that is seasoned with salt.

886
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:05,760
Those questions come,

887
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,840
and I am ready to give an answer

888
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,000
that I may know how ye ought to answer every man.

889
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
There's a funny illustration from years ago.

890
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,560
I think I heard somebody say this

891
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,260
while I was in Bible college.

892
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,059
There was a guy that was at the workplace

893
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,020
and he was talking to somebody about

894
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,180
believing the Bible and so on and so forth.

895
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,600
He's like, well, what do you believe?

896
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,000
He said, well, I believe the same thing my church believes.

897
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,340
He said, okay, well, what's the church believe?

898
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,680
He said, well, they believe the same thing I believe.

899
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,419
He said, well, what is it that both of you believe?

900
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,919
We believe what's in the book.

901
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:45,139
Those aren't good answers.

902
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,840
And if we're going to know how we need to answer every man,

903
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,759
that means we better be studying this book.

904
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:51,720
Amen?

905
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Because there are questions that are...

906
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,360
Listen, I like questions.

907
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,360
I enjoy questions.

908
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,759
If we're understanding the application here

909
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,580
that we're using speech for this season

910
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,380
with salt, appropriate, pure, God-honoring,

911
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,440
but also that which would cause people to desire

912
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,239
to want more, that it would provoke them

913
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,599
to asking questions,

914
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,239
I better be ready to answer the questions.

915
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,000
In 1 Peter 3, in verse 15,

916
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,839
Peter is encouraging these believers

917
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,400
that have been scattered abroad

918
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,559
due to persecution,

919
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,279
and he says this to them,

920
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:31,599
this same thought with regard to being ready for an answer.

921
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,760
He says in 1 Peter 3, in verse 15,

922
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,879
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts

923
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:39,360
and be ready always to give an answer

924
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,879
to every man that asketh you a reason

925
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:45,900
of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.

926
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,199
In your life, in my life,

927
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,599
when's the last time somebody asked us,

928
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,919
why do you seem like you have so much peace?

929
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,599
I mean, the world is just going crazy.

930
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,400
People are scared and confused

931
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,279
and all sorts of things are going on.

932
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,519
Why do you have such peace?

933
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,119
Why is it that you don't use inappropriate language?

934
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,520
I notice in the workplace that you don't talk

935
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,399
like the other people talk.

936
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:21,240
Why is that?

937
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,399
See, people are observing us.

938
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:28,759
As we look at these two verses of Scripture,

939
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,240
these verses fall within that context

940
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,919
in which I mentioned by way of introduction

941
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,339
that is truth for godly living.

942
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,479
And Paul, as he's wrapping up,

943
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:42,699
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

944
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:44,320
this letter to the believers in Colossae,

945
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,399
he says, listen, listen, you have to recognize,

946
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,960
you have to understand the importance of your testimony.

947
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,160
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

948
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,559
Not only the importance of your testimony,

949
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,119
but consider the investment of your time,

950
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,839
redeeming the time.

951
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,080
And then consider the impact of your tongue.

952
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,160
Our tongue can build up, can bring down.

953
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,800
We find that our tongue, our speech is to be all way,

954
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,339
no exceptions, no wiggle room, with grace.

955
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
All way with grace.

956
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,800
Seasoned with salt.

957
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,220
Appropriate, pure, God-honoring.

958
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,399
Get rid of that spirit of complaining.

959
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:33,759
Ask God to help you.

960
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,820
It's easy to complain.

961
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,000
So many people are complaining.

962
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,279
And when other people are complaining,

963
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:41,240
you know what happens to us?

964
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,740
We begin complaining too.

965
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,839
It's so easy.

966
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,899
You just ask somebody that you don't even know.

967
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:51,119
I did this to a neighbor not living here

968
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,880
because I don't have any close neighbors.

969
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,160
But I asked a neighbor when we lived in Manassas,

970
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,000
hey, how are you doing?

971
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,660
And they just stopped and started complaining.

972
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,619
I'm like, I didn't sign up for this.

973
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:04,399
I was trying to grill on my grill for crying out loud.

974
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:06,399
I didn't want all the complaint session.

975
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,559
But guess what happens when somebody starts doing that?

976
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,440
It's easy for us to start complaining.

977
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,860
Yeah, I know, it's bad, man, it's just, right?

978
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,020
It's easy.

979
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,859
He says, season with salt and then let us be ready

980
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,380
to answer those questions that come,

981
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,260
that we'd be studied up and be ready to answer.

982
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,299
Because listen, God's concerned about our conduct.

983
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:33,220
You have a testimony.

984
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,459
People are observing you.

985
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,179
Understand the importance of that.

986
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,540
You have time.

987
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,179
You don't know how much time you have.

988
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,859
I don't know how much time I have.

989
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,420
But time is a precious commodity.

990
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,720
Once it's gone, it's gone.

991
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,179
We need to consider the investment of our time

992
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:51,779
and then consider the impact of our speech.

993
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:56,179
Oh, that God would help us to speak words that edify,

994
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:59,500
that build up, that God would help us to use speech

995
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,619
that is pure, that's God-honoring,

996
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,540
speech that would be seasoned with salt

997
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,179
to cause people to say, I don't know what you have,

998
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,140
but it's different and I want more.

999
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,859
I want to know.

1000
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,459
I want to know what's different about you.

1001
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,299
Walk in wisdom, let's pray.

1002
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,619
Father, we love you.

1003
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:24,100
We thank you for loving us.

1004
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,019
We thank you for the word of God.

1005
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,380
We thank you for how this book gives us instruction

1006
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,420
for holy living.

1007
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:36,179
I pray this morning that we would take the truth

1008
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,700
of your word, make application in our lives,

1009
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,820
just as these believers in Colossae would have had to do.

1010
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:49,859
Believers throughout the centuries have been helped.

1011
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,739
They've studied and applied your word.

1012
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,700
Would you help us to recognize the importance

1013
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,779
of our testimony, help us to consider the investment

1014
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:03,179
of our time and the impact of our tongue.

1015
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,100
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would do work

1016
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,019
in our hearts and lives.

1017
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:09,380
Help us, Lord, to be changed.

1018
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,820
I pray that as you've, this morning,

1019
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,459
through your word, touched hearts,

1020
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:21,059
spoken of specific areas, God, we'd do business with you.

1021
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,220
We'd confess sin where we need to confess sin.

1022
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,980
We'd ask you for help where we need the help.

1023
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,339
God, we'd honor you.

1024
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,179
We'll thank you for each decision that's made

1025
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:35,579
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1026
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:36,420
Would you stand with me?

1027
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,059
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1028
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,940
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1029
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,260
As she does, the altar's open.

1030
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,899
Maybe you wanna come and thank God for the gift of time.

1031
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:47,980
Maybe you wanna ask God to help you

1032
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,420
as you consider your testimony,

1033
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,100
the investment of your time, the impact of your tongue.

1034
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,660
Just ask God to help you in one way or another.

1035
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,700
Ask God to help you to be that witness

1036
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,779
that would cause people to want more.

1037
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
