00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.059
and I'm thankful that God has revealed himself to us

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.820
through the pages of scripture.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.460
We think about that song, God's Word Changes Lives,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.500
and we think about the opportunity

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.180
that we have to read the Bible

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.479
and how God has revealed himself to us

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.100
through the pages of scripture.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.780
I've often said this over the years

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.239
and I believe it to be absolutely true,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.340
the heavens declare the glory of God,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.120
the firmament showeth forth his handiwork,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.579
but the reality is that though the heavens declare

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.540
that there is a God, the glory of God,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.459
the creation cries out that there's a creator,

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.020
but it's through the written Word of God

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.979
that he has revealed to us his attributes, his character.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.360
The fact that what we know about God is found in this book.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.740
How do you know that God loves you?

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.180
Because he told us in his Word, amen?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.259
How do you know that he's coming again?

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.740
We sang, coming again, coming again, how do we know?

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.659
Because his Word tells us.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.860
And what a joy, we could go on and on

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.259
with all the attributes of God,

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:03.779
but the preacher of yesteryear said this,

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:06.239
to know God is to know his Word.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.379
To know God is to know his Word.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.000
And I'm so thankful that as we read the scriptures,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.500
he's given us his attributes,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.940
and then we understand that he's taught us

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.139
of the blessedness of redemption.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.040
Isn't it good to be saved?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.980
I mean, honestly, what a joy to know Christ as your Savior.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.819
He is the Savior of the world,

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.099
but when you know him as your Savior personally,

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.819
we mention often, as you think about that great truth

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.580
in Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.019
He is the great shepherd.

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:39.059
He is the chief shepherd, the good shepherd,

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:42.660
but he is my shepherd, and what a joy to know

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.339
the blessedness of redemption, of salvation

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.779
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.620
I find that as we read the Bible,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.019
that not only does God reveal who he is,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.739
not only does he reveal the plan of redemption,

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.819
but I believe that as you study the scriptures,

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.980
you will find, you will notice,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.180
that God has graciously blessed us

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.459
with instruction for godly living.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.179
As you read the Bible, it's abundantly clear and obvious

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.119
that God is concerned with how we live our lives.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.660
Our conduct, our behavior is important to God.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.139
The reality is that I would argue

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.619
that these portions of scripture

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.539
that teach us of godly living

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.699
are just as important as those portions of scripture

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.860
that reveal to us the attributes of our God.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.779
Amen?

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.779
They're equally important.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.100
They're a blessing.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.740
I shared with somebody on Wednesday evening

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.899
in the foyer there at the end of the service,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.619
they were asking a question, and I said,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.460
I'm just so thankful that God has given us instruction

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.500
for godly living in his word,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.779
and wouldn't it be a sad thing

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.820
if you were being disobedient to God,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.179
you didn't even know you were being disobedient to God

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.179
because he didn't tell you in his word

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:56.940
what he expected of you,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.779
and then you were held accountable for it.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.199
That'd be unfortunate.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:04.300
But God has been gracious to give us instruction

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.440
for godly living.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.059
He's told us some things that don't please him.

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.300
He's told us some things that please him,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.539
and that is wonderful.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.860
Listen, all scripture, the Bible says,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.300
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.899
That's John 3, 16,

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.139
as much as it is any other verse of scripture,

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.220
because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.380
It is not valid that we would take

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.460
certain portions of the word of God and say,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.960
well, I'm gonna accept this,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.460
and I'm gonna cherish these verses,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.559
but these ones over here,

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.300
well, I'm gonna just discard those.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm not interested in those.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.300
We're missing out because God's given us all of it,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.860
and the Bible says that not only has it been given by God,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.899
but it's profitable.

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.699
It's profitable for doctrine,

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.500
for what we believe, for reproof, for correction.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.339
Listen, there are times in which the word of God

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.300
has to correct us.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.440
It has to reprove us, and we ought to be thankful for that.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000
When the word of God steps on our toes, amen,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.259
and it is God's word that reproves, and it corrects,

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.759
and it says for instruction in righteousness,

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.899
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.660
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.820
And I'm thankful for all portions of God's word,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.980
the preacher said this with regard to those that would say,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.420
well, I'm not sure about that verse.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.380
I don't really think that's what that means,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.660
or I really don't think we have to abide by that

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.779
or follow that.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.059
He would take out a marker or a pen knife and say,

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.119
okay, take this and blot it out in your Bible,

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:34.619
or cut it out of your Bible.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:38.119
And they would say, I'm not gonna do that.

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.679
Well, you might as well, right?

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.579
But we'd never wanna cut up our Bibles

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:44.420
or mark out our Bibles,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.559
but if we're not gonna live by it,

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.459
if we're not gonna take the instruction,

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:50.000
we might as well just do that,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.119
because really that's what we're doing anyway.

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.660
And so as we think about the word of God,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.640
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.959
I've titled the message, Walk in Wisdom.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.559
As we examine these couple of verses of scripture,

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.660
I want you to, if you're taking notes,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.160
number one, consider the importance of your testimony.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.440
Notice Colossians four and verse number five.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.359
The Bible says, walk in wisdom

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:14.399
toward them that are without.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:17.720
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.679
Redeeming the time, let your speech be always with grace,

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:25.679
seasoned with salt, that you may know

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.380
how you ought to answer every man.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.239
Number one, consider the importance of your testimony.

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.660
We find here that the scripture starts

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.619
with these three words, walk in wisdom,

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.239
literally to behave ourselves wisely.

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:41.880
We understand that Jesus said this in Matthew 10

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.440
and verse number 16, be you therefore wise as serpents

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.640
and harmless as doves.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.279
We are to walk in wisdom, and we find that it's important,

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.420
it's imperative that we understand

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.559
that we're to behave ourselves wisely,

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:57.600
that as we conduct ourselves,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.040
when we think about our behavior,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.559
that it would be that which is wise,

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:02.760
that which is appropriate.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.000
We find that if we lack wisdom,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.880
God tells us that he has all wisdom,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.440
and he says that if we but ask for wisdom,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.160
that he would give it to us.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.880
And what a blessing when we think about walking in wisdom

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.000
and behaving ourselves wisely.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm mindful as we think about this truth,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.079
this instruction that is given to us

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:23.600
with the importance of our testimony,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.920
I'm mindful of what the Bible says of David.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.220
Hold your hand here and turn to the book of 1 Samuel,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.059
if you will, and I want you to notice in chapter number 18,

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.019
we know that it was in chapter number 16 of 1 Samuel,

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.899
where God had anointed through Samuel,

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.859
David to be the next king of Israel.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.820
He had a rejected Saul because of his disobedience,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.579
and David had been anointed in chapter number 16.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:48.959
It's in chapter number 17 of the book of 1 Samuel

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.339
that God provides us with the record of David and Goliath.

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:54.899
And then we come to the 18th chapter

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.579
of the book of 1 Samuel,

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.579
we begin to read some things about the behavior of David

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.220
that I wanna highlight to you here this morning,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.940
when we think about this truth,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.079
walk in wisdom to behave ourselves wisely.

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:11.679
In 1 Samuel 18, notice in verse number five,

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:12.519
the Bible says,

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:17.160
and David went out whithersoever Saul sent him

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.000
and behaved himself wisely.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.959
And Saul set him over the men of war

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.359
and he was accepted in the sight of all the people

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:27.720
and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.559
Skip down to verse number 14.

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:30.959
Notice again, the Bible says,

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:35.959
and David behaved himself wisely in all his ways

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.260
and the Lord was with him.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.899
It's interesting to me that the verse of Scripture

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.079
ends with the statement that the Lord was with him.

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.679
And we find that this is revealed to us

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:50.260
in a number of people's lives in the Old Testament,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.200
how God is with them and causes them to prosper

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.399
and so on and so forth.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.720
But we find that David's behavior

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.959
and that he behaved himself wisely in all his ways

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.760
is a key factor that helps us understand

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.519
why God was with him.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:05.480
Amen?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.920
We understand as New Testament believers

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.399
that we are indwelled by the Spirit of God.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:13.100
And what a blessing to understand the indwelling

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.200
of the Holy Spirit.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.359
It is the earnest of our salvation.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:19.279
And we find that we are sealed under the day of redemption.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:21.640
And what a joy and what a blessing that is.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.799
He says, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:27.200
But you understand as New Testament believers

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.040
that we can quench and grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.919
We can behave ourselves in manners

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.919
in which are not pleasing to God.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.760
And we find that in those times of quenching

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.619
and grieving the Spirit of God,

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.080
it's not that he departs from us,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.479
but it is not as obvious that he is with us.

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:47.119
Does that make sense to you this morning?

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:48.900
And we find here that the Bible says

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.900
that David behaved himself wisely in all his ways

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.200
and the Lord was with him.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.119
Notice how the passage of Scripture ends

00:08:58.119 --> 00:09:00.960
in 1 Samuel 18 and verse number 30.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.880
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.359
and it came to pass after they went forth

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:11.039
that David behaved himself more wisely

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:13.400
than all the servants of Saul

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.940
so that his name was much set by.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.539
That phrase at the end of verse number 30

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:22.479
means that it was held in high regard and high esteem.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.479
And we find that the Bible tells us here

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:26.960
that he behaved himself more wisely

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.960
than all the servants of Saul.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.039
God tells us in Colossians chapter number four

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.679
and verse number five, walk in wisdom.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.919
But I want you to notice that it says

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:42.520
walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.679
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.099
What is the instruction?

00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:50.919
What is it that Paul is giving the instruction

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.919
to these believers in Colossae?

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:55.280
He's saying this, he's saying walk in wisdom

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.960
toward the unbelievers, toward them that are without.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.359
That when we would understand

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:02.819
understand our conduct and our behavior,

00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:04.159
that we would understand,

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.879
as someone of yesteryear said,

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.919
that sometimes your life might be

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:10.059
the only Bible that some lost person

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:11.919
ever reads or ever observes,

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.079
and the reality is that there are people

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.619
that are watching us.

00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:17.619
We don't even know who those people are.

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:18.979
Who is observing you?

00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:20.279
And let me ask this,

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:23.199
what is it that they're observing?

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:25.439
Are we walking in wisdom toward them

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:27.119
that are without understanding

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.879
that there are people that we come in contact with

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.139
that God has given us the opportunity

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.079
to show the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.319
and in our lives that he, Jesus,

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:37.979
would be exalted and magnified,

00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:39.919
that we'd say, as John the Baptist said,

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:42.219
he must increase and I must decrease,

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:43.839
that as our lives,

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.059
as we find in Matthew chapter number five,

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:46.899
when Jesus says,

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:49.739
let your light so shine before men

00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:51.559
that they may see your good works

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:54.039
and what, glorify your Father,

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.399
which is in heaven.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.679
And what a joy to understand that

00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:00.759
as we look at this couple of verses of scripture,

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:03.039
it begins with this instruction

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:06.419
of reminding us the importance of your testimony.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.359
There are people that are watching us,

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:09.679
that are observing us.

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.119
I did not take the time,

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:12.719
but if you jot down in your notes,

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:15.279
first Samuel 16 and verse number 18,

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.399
it's a powerful verse of scripture.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.239
I'm not even,

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.799
I just wanna make sure I'm giving you the right reference.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.979
First Samuel 16 and verse number 18,

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.399
that there's an unnamed servant of Saul

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.239
that observes David

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:29.239
and gives this great recommendation

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:32.059
of David being the one that is selected

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:33.879
to come into the house of Saul

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.719
and to play with that evil spirit

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:37.159
that troubled him.

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.199
We find that there are people that are observing you.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.399
What would they say of you?

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.759
What would they say of me?

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.099
The instruction to the believers in Colossae

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:49.359
is to be mindful of

00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:53.159
and to understand the importance of their testimony,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:56.999
to walk in wisdom toward them

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:58.399
that are without,

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:01.439
that we would not behave ourselves foolishly,

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:03.079
that we would not behave ourselves

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.879
in a manner in which it would bring a reproach

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:06.339
against the name of God,

00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:09.039
that we'd understand our testimony.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.479
We often say,

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:13.679
as we would think about our own children,

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:15.319
that they represent our family,

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:18.479
but they also represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:20.419
When we have teen activities

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:22.279
and we're taking teenagers on trips

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:25.159
to teen camp or to some other activity,

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:27.359
we'll say to the teenagers something like this.

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:29.879
Remember that you represent Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:30.799
but more importantly,

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:33.839
you represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.839
That we'd be mindful

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:38.159
that we would consider the importance of our testimony.

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:40.399
There are people that are observing us.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.359
There's some people that are watching you.

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:44.959
You don't even know that they're watching you.

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.239
He says that we are to walk in wisdom

00:12:47.239 --> 00:12:50.559
toward them that are without.

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.759
Notice the end of verse number five,

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:55.879
redeeming the time.

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:57.119
Not only should we consider

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:58.519
the importance of our testimony,

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.879
but I believe number two,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:03.079
you should consider the investment of your time.

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:04.719
The investment of your time.

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:06.319
He says redeeming the time.

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:08.299
You know, time is something that's very interesting.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.019
Time is a gift from God.

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:12.959
It really is.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.579
Life, breath, time.

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.319
It's a gift from God.

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:18.199
I would say this,

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:20.599
that time is a precious commodity.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.239
Let me say this,

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.039
if you waste your money,

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:28.239
that can be folly and that can be unfortunate,

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:29.399
but you can regain it.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:33.279
If you waste your time,

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.759
it is gone forever.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.039
Right?

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.479
You can waste money.

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:39.839
You can lose money.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.099
You can make a foolish investment of money.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:45.839
And perhaps you can recover from that foolish investment.

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.319
Perhaps you can recover from that wasteful spending

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:49.959
and you can kind of get back on track

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.039
and so on and so forth.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.819
But when you waste time,

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:55.079
it's gone.

00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:56.359
You can't get it back.

00:13:57.599 --> 00:13:59.519
Listen, if I wasted an hour yesterday,

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.159
I can't regain it today.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.139
It's gone.

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:04.679
I can't take an hour today and say,

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.919
I'm gonna store this up for tomorrow.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.999
Just doesn't work that way.

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:11.839
Time is a precious commodity.

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:12.879
Let me say this,

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:16.359
there's not one of us in our room today

00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:17.699
that's on this property today,

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:20.099
that's tuned in via live stream today,

00:14:20.099 --> 00:14:23.679
that has any idea of how much time they have left.

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:24.979
Not one of us.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.599
We think that we make plans considering the future

00:14:29.599 --> 00:14:32.919
and considering future things and what have you.

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:37.079
And if you look at calendars as you fill up your schedule

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:40.439
for days and weeks and perhaps months in advance,

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:43.319
I have people that are scheduled to come here

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:45.279
to our church for missions conferences

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:48.519
and for revival meetings for two, three years from now

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:49.879
that are scheduled out.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:52.000
But the reality is that they don't know

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.839
and I don't know if we're even gonna be here still.

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:57.099
Amen?

00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:00.039
And so when we think about time

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.699
and we think about this simple statement

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.759
that is made redeeming the time,

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:08.039
we must consider the investment of our time.

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.000
We must understand that it's important

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:11.719
that we use our time wisely,

00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:14.439
that we seize the opportunities that God gives us.

00:15:14.439 --> 00:15:17.619
The idea of this phraseology of redeeming the time

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:21.119
is to use it wisely, to understand the preciousness of time

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:23.000
and to use it appropriately.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.739
If you were to do the calculations,

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:26.279
you would understand that, of course,

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:31.279
each day we have 24 hours, we have 1,440 minutes per day.

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:36.759
86,400 seconds per day.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:38.519
Now obviously there's some time in there

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:41.239
that we need to sleep and we understand that.

00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:44.559
And by the way, God created us that we need sleep

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.500
and that's just part of what it is.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.199
Now we're not to love sleep.

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:50.079
Proverbs warns us about that.

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:52.239
But the reality is that we need sleep.

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.799
But there are portions of our day that we get

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:58.559
that we have to look at maybe in that manner.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.379
Maybe we break it down by the minutes.

00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:04.359
I have 1,440 minutes today, how am I gonna use those?

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:08.199
I have 86,400 seconds today, how am I gonna use those?

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:11.039
What if it was, Brother Ron, if I came to you today

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:14.399
and said, here's $1,440, use it wisely?

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:18.319
At the end of the day, it's gone though.

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.839
Tomorrow you're gonna get another $1,440

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:24.839
but you can't save it for the next day.

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:28.799
You gotta use it and you gotta use it wisely.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:32.099
And we would really consider how we use that money.

00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:33.439
Would we not?

00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:36.239
And we'd really work hard to use all of it

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:39.519
because it's gonna be gone at the end of the day, right?

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.959
We say, I just have this $1,440 to just use today.

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:44.699
It's for today, this is all I have.

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:48.879
I'm gonna get another $1,440 tomorrow

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:50.519
but I'm gonna be careful how I spend it.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.879
I'm gonna try to spend it wisely.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:55.159
I'm gonna try to use it to its fullest ability.

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:57.559
What about our time?

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.119
What about our minutes?

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:00.759
What about the seconds that God gives us?

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:04.319
Time is precious, it is a precious commodity.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.359
And we understand that we have to invest our time wisely,

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.119
redeeming the time.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.799
Proverbs 27 in verse number one,

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.159
the wise man gives us insight.

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:18.859
Listen, the reality is that we know

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.599
that our days are numbered

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.959
and we understand that we just have a certain amount

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:26.479
of time here on this earth.

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.039
As it is appointed unto man wants to die

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.500
after this the judgment.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.079
That's what God says in his word, right?

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:34.399
There's a time in which we're gonna die.

00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:36.479
It's interesting to me how hard

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:40.959
and how just in these last several months,

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.119
this last couple of years,

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:45.299
how people have tried to preserve life.

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:50.379
They've tried so hard to preserve life

00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:55.319
but in so doing they stopped living life, right?

00:17:55.319 --> 00:18:00.000
We're working to preserve life but we stopped living life.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.119
I read an interesting article last week

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:05.839
of the Amish folks up in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:08.439
They were the first group of people

00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:13.079
that were acknowledged of having herd immunity from COVID.

00:18:14.199 --> 00:18:15.959
And you know one of the things they said?

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:17.599
We just couldn't stop living.

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:21.159
We weren't gonna let our loved ones die in a hospital

00:18:21.159 --> 00:18:22.079
without being able to see them.

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:24.959
We weren't gonna stop gathering as a church.

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:27.199
We weren't gonna stop, that's what they said.

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:31.359
And they had fewer deaths than a lot of other people did.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:34.839
I'm not trying to get into some hot debate situation

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.559
this morning but simply what I'm saying

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.000
is that we have time.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.919
We've tried to preserve our lives

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.679
but in so doing we stopped living our lives.

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.200
And we don't know how much time we have.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.200
We really don't.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.779
We can read every day in the news.

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:53.880
In fact, I read two weeks ago

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.880
how the automobile casualties have increased 15 to 20%

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:01.119
in the last six months.

00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:03.159
I didn't read the whole article

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:06.440
but I read this morning that in all 50 states of America

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.399
people are drinking contaminated water.

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.200
What, are we gonna stop drinking?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.760
No, we can't, right?

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.099
And so the reality is that we have to use wisdom.

00:19:16.099 --> 00:19:18.339
We walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:20.719
We understand this thing of investing our time

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:22.619
and that God has given us time.

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:24.399
It's a precious commodity.

00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:26.359
And notice what Proverbs 27 says.

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:28.399
Boast not thyself of tomorrow

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:33.000
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.719
We don't know what's on tomorrow.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.679
So many people wanna talk about how many people

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:41.299
have died from COVID in the last 18 months

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:43.760
and I understand it's tragic, it's unfortunate

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.519
but the reality is that there are tens of millions of people

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.159
that have died from other things.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:53.579
Because every day people are dying.

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:55.959
People are dying.

00:19:57.399 --> 00:19:58.239
Every day.

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.479
Life is precious.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:03.879
It is precious.

00:20:03.879 --> 00:20:07.599
James chapter number 4, verses 13 and 14,

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:09.919
Go to now ye that say, today or tomorrow

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:11.799
we will go into such a city,

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:12.919
and continue there a year,

00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:15.639
and buy and sell and get gain.

00:20:15.639 --> 00:20:19.959
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow.

00:20:19.959 --> 00:20:22.199
And then this question for what is your life?

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:24.839
What is your life?

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:28.199
Is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.279
and then vanisheth away.

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:33.119
How long is that little time?

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:34.879
We don't know.

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:36.479
But if we took a field trip this morning

00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:39.719
to the closest cemetery,

00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:41.759
you'd find that there are people that died

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:44.159
at just hours old,

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.799
and there are people that died at over 100.

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:51.919
Correct?

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:54.159
What is your life?

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:56.359
Our time, the investment of our time.

00:20:56.399 --> 00:20:58.399
We understand the importance of our testimony.

00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:01.239
He says, walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:02.679
He then says that we're to consider

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.359
the investment of our time,

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:06.119
that we're to redeem the time,

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.199
understanding that it is a precious commodity,

00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:09.839
it is a gift from God,

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.479
and it's a little vapor.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.759
It's just a vapor that appeareth for a little time

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:16.759
and then vanisheth away.

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:21.439
The Psalms talk about our life being like a shadow.

00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:25.359
We find that Psalm 90 that's attributed to Moses,

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:28.079
when he talks about our life being threescore and ten,

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:30.799
or by reason of strength, fourscore years.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:33.239
And we think about that reference.

00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:35.279
So teach us to number our days

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:37.359
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:40.319
But we find just previous to that text of Scripture,

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.639
a few verses before,

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:45.799
he says that we live our life as a tale that is told.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:48.519
Man, according to Ecclesiastes 12,

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:50.999
goes to his long home.

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.999
Man goes to his long home.

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.279
And we understand eternity

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:58.159
and how it's so precious and so joyful

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:00.879
for us to know the reality of heaven

00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:03.239
and to understand Christ as our Savior.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:07.439
But we understand that until we hear that trumpet sound

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:10.279
or until we take that last breath here upon earth,

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:13.399
and none of us know the time in which that will happen,

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:16.519
we have this moment to live life,

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:19.399
to invest our time.

00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:21.439
We consider the importance of our testimony.

00:22:21.479 --> 00:22:24.519
We consider the investment of our time.

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.519
Why is it so important?

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:28.159
Because once it's gone, it's gone.

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:30.479
It's gone.

00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:32.999
Never to be captured back again.

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:34.999
Notice as we move on to verse number six

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.759
back in Colossians 4,

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:41.119
not only the importance of our testimony,

00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:43.319
the investment of our time,

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:45.639
but I want you to notice in verse number six,

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:47.439
the Bible says,

00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:50.959
let your speech be always with grace,

00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:52.879
seasoned with salt,

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:57.199
that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:01.559
Consider finally this morning the impact of your tongue.

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:02.559
The impact of your tongue.

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.999
We notice the importance of our testimony,

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:06.159
the investment of our time,

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.119
and we see here finally in verse number six

00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:10.639
the impact of our tongue.

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.679
The book of James speaks much about the tongue.

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.119
We will not take time this morning

00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:17.599
to go to those passages of Scripture,

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:19.799
but we understand that it's a little member.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:22.879
It can cause all kinds of problems, right?

00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:25.399
And we need to consider the impact of our tongue.

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:28.319
You know that your tongue, there's power in your speech.

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:30.039
There's power in your tongue.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:35.039
You can build up or you can bring down through our speech.

00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:38.879
In verse number six,

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:41.399
we find that previous in chapter number three,

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:43.999
he had spoken about communication.

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:45.959
He talked about putting off those things

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:47.199
in chapter number three.

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:49.399
And we mentioned as you go to the book of Ephesians

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:51.439
and you find reference with regard to our speech,

00:23:51.439 --> 00:23:52.839
but throughout the word of God,

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.519
there are many things in which God gives us

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:55.679
with regard to our speech.

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:57.399
But we notice here that he says,

00:23:57.399 --> 00:24:02.079
let your speech, notice what he says, be always.

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.919
I like the fact that he says always

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.559
because there are no exceptions.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:09.159
We like exceptions, don't we?

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:11.319
But do you know what they said to me?

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:13.119
You ask a little kid, why did you do that?

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.639
Well, I did that because they did this.

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:15.479
Why did you say that?

00:24:15.479 --> 00:24:17.879
Well, I said this because they said that.

00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:19.879
But as God's people, he says,

00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:24.879
let your speech be always with grace.

00:24:26.879 --> 00:24:30.159
No exceptions, no wiggle room.

00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:31.399
Have you ever had somebody speak to you

00:24:31.399 --> 00:24:34.199
in a manner in which you kind of feel like,

00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:36.919
all right, the gloves are coming out, right?

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:38.439
We can do this.

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:41.679
But as a child of God,

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:43.599
I feel like at times I can tell you

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:46.679
there are times that I have been in situations

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:49.599
in which I know the person I've been talking to

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:51.599
was trying to berate me in such a way

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:54.479
so that I would speak back in like fashion.

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:55.719
I know it.

00:24:55.719 --> 00:24:58.359
I could give you illustrations, I won't bore you.

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.159
But the reality is that as a child of God,

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.319
we are told that we are to understand

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:05.999
and consider the impact of our tongue

00:25:05.999 --> 00:25:10.199
to let your speech be always with grace.

00:25:10.199 --> 00:25:11.039
I would say this,

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.799
notice back in chapter number three in verse number 16,

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:16.439
if we have grace in our hearts,

00:25:16.439 --> 00:25:18.159
then we'll have grace in our speech.

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:20.839
Notice what he says in Colossians 3 in verse number 16.

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:24.319
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:26.239
teaching and admonishing one another

00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:28.559
in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:33.399
singing how with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:36.039
As the word of Christ is dwelling in us richly

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:38.759
in all wisdom, how important verse number 16

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:41.679
of Colossians 3 is to verses five and six.

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.359
By the way, as you study the entirety

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:46.439
of the book of Colossians as we have this calendar year

00:25:46.439 --> 00:25:49.159
in building one message upon another message,

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:52.919
you understand how the truth of chapter number three,

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:55.719
as we mentioned the put off and put on principles

00:25:55.719 --> 00:25:57.599
and we spent weeks dealing with that

00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:59.999
and how that then results itself

00:25:59.999 --> 00:26:02.799
in the behavior in church, the behavior in our home,

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.319
the behavior in the workplace,

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:07.039
and we find even now as we continue to receive

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:09.199
these words of instruction as we conclude

00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:11.439
this final chapter of the book of Colossians

00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:15.039
that when I've taken the instruction of chapter number three

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:18.239
and properly applied it in my heart and my life,

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:20.079
then I'm able to walk in wisdom

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:21.119
toward them that are without.

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:22.639
I'm able to redeem the time.

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:26.279
I'm able to let my speech be always with grace,

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:30.239
seasoned with salt.

00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:33.639
In fact, it's interesting as we think about our speech

00:26:33.639 --> 00:26:36.639
being always with grace in Luke 4 in verse 22,

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.399
it says, and all bear him witness

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:40.159
speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:42.879
and wondered at the gracious words

00:26:42.879 --> 00:26:47.039
which proceeded out of his mouth.

00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:51.159
Seasoned with salt, the Bible says.

00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:54.319
I believe that as we look at this phraseology,

00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:55.919
we think about our speech

00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:58.479
and oftentimes we think about seasoning with salt,

00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:00.679
we think about cooking, do we not?

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:02.799
And we think about the importance of using some salt

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:05.459
in our cooking as we would prepare meals

00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:06.439
and so on and so forth,

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.559
but here the word of God says

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.799
that we're to season our speech,

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.119
that our speech is to be always with grace,

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:16.039
seasoned with salt.

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:19.759
It's kind of interesting as we would understand

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:22.039
this phraseology and it carries with it

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:24.999
the idea of that which is appropriate,

00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:29.159
that which is pure, that which is God honoring.

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:32.559
We understand that salt preserves

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:35.199
and we do not use it in such a manner

00:27:35.199 --> 00:27:37.139
as much today as they did years ago

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:38.779
or even in biblical times,

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:40.739
but we find that when he speaks about our speech

00:27:40.739 --> 00:27:42.259
being seasoned with salt,

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.699
it's that which is appropriate,

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:46.359
that which is pure, that which is God honoring.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:49.359
It's interesting in our bulletin today,

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:52.019
we have there on the right hand of the page

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:53.459
in everything give thanks.

00:27:53.459 --> 00:27:55.219
First Thessalonians 5 in verse 18,

00:27:55.219 --> 00:27:56.679
it's the month of November

00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:58.899
and of course we have on our calendar

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:00.799
Thanksgiving in the month of November,

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:03.999
but the reality is that as the people of God,

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:07.459
we don't just reserve thankfulness for November.

00:28:08.719 --> 00:28:11.519
Set to a Thursday in November even more specifically.

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:15.219
No, we're to be thankful always, correct?

00:28:16.179 --> 00:28:18.219
We think about this truth when it says

00:28:18.219 --> 00:28:19.819
let your speech be always with grace,

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:22.139
seasoned with salt, that which is appropriate,

00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:24.319
pure, God honoring.

00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:28.599
I would say this, that we're living in a time,

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:30.459
we're living in the midst of a time

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:33.639
in which there's this spirit of complaining.

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:35.579
This spirit of complaining.

00:28:35.579 --> 00:28:37.940
God tells us that this would be the case

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.539
for in 2 Timothy 3 when he speaks about

00:28:40.539 --> 00:28:43.000
the way in which the last times,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.219
the perilous times that we're living in

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:48.099
would be described, he says at the end of verse number two,

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:50.940
unthankful and unholy.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.179
We're living in a time in which there seems to be

00:28:54.179 --> 00:28:57.260
this increased amount of a spirit of complaining

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.739
and then all of a sudden I go back to the word of God

00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:02.099
and I say actually this thing of complaining

00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:05.099
and murmuring has always been part of human nature.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.239
When you look back into the Old Testament

00:29:08.239 --> 00:29:09.559
and you look at the children of Israel,

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:12.199
they're always murmuring and complaining.

00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:14.119
I would ask you this morning as we think about

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.199
the spirit of complaining, I would ask you this morning

00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:20.919
is that appropriate, is that pure, is that God honoring?

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:23.739
You know when we complain about our circumstances,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
we're really calling God onto the stage so to speak

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.219
because he's done something wrong.

00:29:34.219 --> 00:29:37.219
But God never does anything wrong, correct?

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:42.219
And we think about when Moses on a number of occasions

00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:43.959
when the people would complain, what do you say?

00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:45.019
You're not complaining against me,

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:47.339
you're complaining against God.

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.779
You're complaining against God.

00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:51.779
And this spirit of complaining I believe

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:54.299
that it's something that is so prevalent

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:57.380
in our society today, something that has influenced

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.179
and impacted and it's unfortunate

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:01.039
because as the people of God.

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:07.499
God, our speech is to be always with grace, seasoned with salt.

00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:14.159
If we're complaining and murmuring, how that displeases God.

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:17.919
How that disappoints our Savior.

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:20.479
For He's good all the time, is He not?

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:24.519
We say something like this, it's certainly more than a cliché, but we'll make the statement

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:30.439
God is good, and then we'll say all the time, and then somebody else might say all the time

00:30:30.439 --> 00:30:32.619
God is good.

00:30:32.619 --> 00:30:38.679
But if we're complaining, are we really saying that God is good?

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:40.119
God is good all the time?

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:44.359
I would say this, it's easy to complain, it really is.

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:48.759
It's a lot harder to be thankful, it is.

00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:52.879
It's easy to complain about circumstances and situations.

00:30:52.879 --> 00:30:58.359
In fact, I will be very transparent with you this morning, I had to confess to God to this,

00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:03.199
I was complaining about complaining.

00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:06.399
If I could share with you a little bit of the complaints that I get on a regular basis,

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:09.319
you'd go nuts.

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:13.279
And I found myself complaining about complaining.

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:23.399
And God smoked my heart and said, stop it, give thanks, sorry Lord.

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:27.359
Being transparent, it's easy to complain.

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:33.519
But oh, how our speech is to be with grace and seasoned with salt, that which is appropriate,

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:37.759
that which is pure, that which is God-honoring.

00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:42.399
It's interesting as we think about salt preserving, but I would also say this, have you ever had

00:31:42.399 --> 00:31:45.919
something that was super salty, like it was too heavy-handed on the salt?

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:49.959
A meal, y'all are laughing, sometimes, right, you get too much salt.

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:51.839
What happens when you have too much salt?

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:54.359
Well, you can swell up, but what else happens?

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:57.319
You need something to drink, you're thirsty, right?

00:31:57.319 --> 00:31:58.879
You need something to drink.

00:31:58.879 --> 00:32:02.679
So I think about this when I look at this phrase where it says seasoned with salt, and

00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:07.879
especially as we look at the latter part of verse number six, it seems to be indicative

00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:13.719
of this being part of the interpretation or the application at least, not only does salt

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:18.919
preserve and our speech needs to be that which is appropriate, pure, and God-honoring, but

00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:21.359
salt also makes thirsty.

00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:26.919
And so I wonder this morning is our speech in such a way in which it would make people

00:32:26.919 --> 00:32:33.199
want more, that they would be thirsty, that they would be thirsty for truth.

00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:39.319
Listen, we're living in a time in which there's a famine of truth.

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:41.799
There's a famine of truth.

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:47.079
And can I tell you this morning that we can use our speech in such a way that as we're

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:50.879
speaking, not only honoring God, not only that which is appropriate and that which is

00:32:50.879 --> 00:32:56.599
pleasing and pure, but also that we can use our speech in such a way that people that

00:32:56.599 --> 00:33:00.159
hear us are going to say, I want to know more about that.

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:01.159
That's just different.

00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:02.479
I haven't heard that before.

00:33:02.479 --> 00:33:05.999
I use the illustration many times over the years.

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:11.879
My dad used the illustration last year when he preached in January after I had that operation.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:17.199
But the reality is that there was a man that was witnessing the day that my dad walked

00:33:17.199 --> 00:33:22.159
through the shop in which he was working down at Camp Geiger in North Carolina.

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:27.399
And as he was walking past that place where those men were there sorting brass ammunition

00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:32.279
at the School of Infantry, we find that this man was a Christian and he was speaking to

00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:35.319
the other man and he said this, there are a lot of dead people in the world that are

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:38.359
just waiting to die.

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:41.279
That was speech that had salt.

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.319
You know why?

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:46.639
It stopped my dad in his tracks who was lost.

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:49.839
And he said, what does that mean?

00:33:49.839 --> 00:33:50.839
That's salt.

00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:51.839
I want more.

00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:53.439
I want to understand that.

00:33:53.439 --> 00:33:56.719
What does that mean?

00:33:56.719 --> 00:34:01.399
He said, well, what it means is that there are a lot of people that are dead spiritually

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:05.519
that are just waiting to die a physical death.

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:08.959
And at that moment, my dad, he would tell you, he's watching this morning, he would

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.959
tell you, that's me.

00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:17.119
I'm dead spiritually, but I'm waiting to die a physical death.

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:21.079
So on that day, I don't know what day it was, but on that day, you know what happened?

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:26.119
My dad came home and he said, we're going to church on Sunday.

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.799
We're doing what?

00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:31.759
It wasn't Christmas and Easter and actually for the number of years, it didn't matter

00:34:31.759 --> 00:34:32.759
if it was Christmas and Easter.

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:33.759
We didn't go to church anyway.

00:34:33.759 --> 00:34:34.759
Seriously.

00:34:34.759 --> 00:34:35.759
He said, we're going to church.

00:34:35.759 --> 00:34:40.359
What do you mean we're going to church?

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:42.759
It was speech with salt.

00:34:42.759 --> 00:34:44.659
He needed to find out.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.519
He wanted more.

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:50.079
He went to church and got nothing.

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:52.679
The liberal church didn't preach the gospel.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.999
He went back to that Marine and said, what church do you go to?

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:58.399
Because that's where I need to go.

00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:03.679
And he went to Grace Baptist Church in Jacksonville, North Carolina and got saved.

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:05.719
Because somebody had speech that had salt.

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:08.279
It was seasoned with salt.

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:09.279
Here's a man that came here.

00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:13.679
He was working during the project, the parsonage, and he was here and he was doing some surveying.

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:16.639
And I spoke with this man and I shared some truth with him.

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:18.919
And then I just kind of left him.

00:35:18.919 --> 00:35:22.999
Just asked him some questions, tried to use speech that was seasoned with salt to make

00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:25.079
him want more.

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.759
Here's a problem that I have often.

00:35:26.759 --> 00:35:31.599
I just back up the truckload of truth and just dump it on somebody.

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.639
You ever feel like you do that?

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:37.479
And I'm working actively in my life to stop doing that.

00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:38.479
Why?

00:35:38.479 --> 00:35:42.319
Because I want to use speech that's seasoned with salt that I want to know if they're truly

00:35:42.319 --> 00:35:46.519
interested in knowing more.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:51.959
The man came back several weeks later to work on another surveying issue that he was working

00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:53.279
on.

00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:54.279
And I walked outside.

00:35:54.279 --> 00:35:57.159
I saw that it was the same guy and I said, hey man, how are you?

00:35:57.159 --> 00:35:58.159
Good to see you.

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:00.319
I said, did you think about what I asked you?

00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:03.479
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:36:03.479 --> 00:36:06.279
I need an answer.

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:07.279
I need an answer.

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.079
He's a Muslim.

00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.079
And you know what I asked him?

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.639
Who's his lamb?

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:16.639
God provided a lamb for Abraham.

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:18.599
Moses had a lamb.

00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:19.599
Who's your lamb?

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:22.799
That's all I asked him.

00:36:22.799 --> 00:36:25.239
Do you have a lamb?

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:28.199
So for weeks he thinks about this.

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:31.079
He talks to his wife about it.

00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:32.079
He comes back.

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:33.079
I said, do you have an answer?

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:34.079
He said, no.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.439
He said, I can't stop thinking about this.

00:36:37.439 --> 00:36:39.439
What do you mean do I have a lamb?

00:36:39.439 --> 00:36:41.439
That's what he says.

00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:42.439
That's all right.

00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:45.119
I'll let you get to your work.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.119
Have a good day.

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:47.239
He said, no, no, no.

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:48.239
You need to tell me.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.479
That's what he says.

00:36:49.479 --> 00:36:52.999
I'm trying to walk back to the church and he's like, Colin, no, no, no.

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:54.559
And here's what he tells me.

00:36:54.559 --> 00:36:57.679
He said, it is your job to tell me.

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:00.639
That's what he told me.

00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:04.559
He wanted truth.

00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:08.919
He said, what is this lamb?

00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:11.439
Is it my works?

00:37:11.439 --> 00:37:18.559
I said, sir, it's not a what, it's a who.

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:26.119
John the Baptist says, behold, the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:27.999
I wish that guy got saved in the parking lot.

00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:31.679
He didn't, but he's wanting more.

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:33.879
He's wanting more.

00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:41.639
I wonder when we look at a simple couple of verses of instruction in Colossians 4, 5,

00:37:41.639 --> 00:37:46.139
and 6, are we mindful of the impact of our tongue?

00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:50.519
Not only that our speech would be always with grace, seasoned with salt, not only that which

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:56.559
is appropriate and pure, but that which would cause people to want more.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:38:02.159
That we would learn to speak in the manner in which Jesus spoke.

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:08.639
You know, many times as you read the Gospels, you'll find that Jesus asked questions.

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:12.559
He asked questions.

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:17.759
And he would ask questions to see the interest of individuals as they would respond.

00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:22.479
He would leave statements and he would ask questions that would be speech seasoned with

00:38:22.479 --> 00:38:29.119
salt to cause people to want to hear more, to know more.

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:34.639
And I believe that it's a truth of application here because it says at the end of verse number

00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:45.159
6, notice what it says, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:51.239
So if my speech is seasoned with salt, not only that which is appropriate and pure and

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:57.519
God-honoring, but it's that which would provoke someone to want to know more, someone that

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:04.279
is thirsty, someone that's asking questions, I find that to be a proper application here

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:08.940
because he ends the verse by saying that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.719
Why are they asking questions?

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:16.880
Because I've used speech that's salty, that causes them to want more, to inquire, and

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.239
to desire, to know what it is that we're speaking about.

00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:25.479
And when you make statements, when you speak about as you would consider your testimony,

00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:29.159
the importance of your testimony, walking in wisdom toward them that are without, when

00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:34.119
you speak on a daily basis within those that you work with and those that you live around

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:39.559
and those that are your family and you speak in such a way that people say, I don't have

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:41.559
that peace.

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:44.039
I don't have that confidence.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:46.639
I don't have that certainty.

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:48.839
How is it that you are so confident?

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:51.320
How is it that you have this peace?

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.500
It's not my peace, it's God's peace.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.320
It's not my confidence, it's the confidence that God gives me through His Word.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.000
And as those questions come...

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.339
We've used speech that is seasoned with salt.

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:05.760
Those questions come,

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.840
and I am ready to give an answer

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.000
that I may know how ye ought to answer every man.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.680
There's a funny illustration from years ago.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.560
I think I heard somebody say this

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.260
while I was in Bible college.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.059
There was a guy that was at the workplace

00:40:21.059 --> 00:40:23.020
and he was talking to somebody about

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.180
believing the Bible and so on and so forth.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.600
He's like, well, what do you believe?

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.000
He said, well, I believe the same thing my church believes.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.340
He said, okay, well, what's the church believe?

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.680
He said, well, they believe the same thing I believe.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.419
He said, well, what is it that both of you believe?

00:40:38.419 --> 00:40:40.919
We believe what's in the book.

00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:45.139
Those aren't good answers.

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:47.840
And if we're going to know how we need to answer every man,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.759
that means we better be studying this book.

00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:51.720
Amen?

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.840
Because there are questions that are...

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.360
Listen, I like questions.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.360
I enjoy questions.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.759
If we're understanding the application here

00:40:58.759 --> 00:41:01.580
that we're using speech for this season

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.380
with salt, appropriate, pure, God-honoring,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.440
but also that which would cause people to desire

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.239
to want more, that it would provoke them

00:41:09.239 --> 00:41:10.599
to asking questions,

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:13.239
I better be ready to answer the questions.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.000
In 1 Peter 3, in verse 15,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.839
Peter is encouraging these believers

00:41:22.839 --> 00:41:24.400
that have been scattered abroad

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.559
due to persecution,

00:41:26.559 --> 00:41:28.279
and he says this to them,

00:41:28.279 --> 00:41:31.599
this same thought with regard to being ready for an answer.

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:33.760
He says in 1 Peter 3, in verse 15,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.879
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts

00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:39.360
and be ready always to give an answer

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.879
to every man that asketh you a reason

00:41:41.879 --> 00:41:45.900
of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.199
In your life, in my life,

00:41:49.199 --> 00:41:51.599
when's the last time somebody asked us,

00:41:52.599 --> 00:41:55.919
why do you seem like you have so much peace?

00:41:57.199 --> 00:41:59.599
I mean, the world is just going crazy.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:04.400
People are scared and confused

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.279
and all sorts of things are going on.

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:08.519
Why do you have such peace?

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:16.119
Why is it that you don't use inappropriate language?

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.520
I notice in the workplace that you don't talk

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.399
like the other people talk.

00:42:20.399 --> 00:42:21.240
Why is that?

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.399
See, people are observing us.

00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:28.759
As we look at these two verses of Scripture,

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:33.240
these verses fall within that context

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.919
in which I mentioned by way of introduction

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:37.339
that is truth for godly living.

00:42:38.399 --> 00:42:40.479
And Paul, as he's wrapping up,

00:42:40.479 --> 00:42:42.699
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:42:42.699 --> 00:42:44.320
this letter to the believers in Colossae,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.399
he says, listen, listen, you have to recognize,

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:51.960
you have to understand the importance of your testimony.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.160
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.559
Not only the importance of your testimony,

00:42:57.559 --> 00:43:00.119
but consider the investment of your time,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.839
redeeming the time.

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:09.080
And then consider the impact of your tongue.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.160
Our tongue can build up, can bring down.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.800
We find that our tongue, our speech is to be all way,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.339
no exceptions, no wiggle room, with grace.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.440
All way with grace.

00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:26.800
Seasoned with salt.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.220
Appropriate, pure, God-honoring.

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:32.399
Get rid of that spirit of complaining.

00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:33.759
Ask God to help you.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.820
It's easy to complain.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.000
So many people are complaining.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.279
And when other people are complaining,

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:41.240
you know what happens to us?

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.740
We begin complaining too.

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:45.839
It's so easy.

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:48.899
You just ask somebody that you don't even know.

00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:51.119
I did this to a neighbor not living here

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.880
because I don't have any close neighbors.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.160
But I asked a neighbor when we lived in Manassas,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.000
hey, how are you doing?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.660
And they just stopped and started complaining.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.619
I'm like, I didn't sign up for this.

00:44:01.979 --> 00:44:04.399
I was trying to grill on my grill for crying out loud.

00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:06.399
I didn't want all the complaint session.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.559
But guess what happens when somebody starts doing that?

00:44:10.559 --> 00:44:12.440
It's easy for us to start complaining.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.860
Yeah, I know, it's bad, man, it's just, right?

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.020
It's easy.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.859
He says, season with salt and then let us be ready

00:44:20.859 --> 00:44:23.380
to answer those questions that come,

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.260
that we'd be studied up and be ready to answer.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.299
Because listen, God's concerned about our conduct.

00:44:31.299 --> 00:44:33.220
You have a testimony.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.459
People are observing you.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.179
Understand the importance of that.

00:44:37.179 --> 00:44:38.540
You have time.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.179
You don't know how much time you have.

00:44:40.179 --> 00:44:41.859
I don't know how much time I have.

00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:45.420
But time is a precious commodity.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.720
Once it's gone, it's gone.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.179
We need to consider the investment of our time

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.779
and then consider the impact of our speech.

00:44:51.779 --> 00:44:56.179
Oh, that God would help us to speak words that edify,

00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:59.500
that build up, that God would help us to use speech

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.619
that is pure, that's God-honoring,

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:04.540
speech that would be seasoned with salt

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.179
to cause people to say, I don't know what you have,

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:11.140
but it's different and I want more.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.859
I want to know.

00:45:12.859 --> 00:45:15.459
I want to know what's different about you.

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:18.299
Walk in wisdom, let's pray.

00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.619
Father, we love you.

00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:24.100
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.019
We thank you for the word of God.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.380
We thank you for how this book gives us instruction

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.420
for holy living.

00:45:33.299 --> 00:45:36.179
I pray this morning that we would take the truth

00:45:37.619 --> 00:45:40.700
of your word, make application in our lives,

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.820
just as these believers in Colossae would have had to do.

00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:49.859
Believers throughout the centuries have been helped.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.739
They've studied and applied your word.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.700
Would you help us to recognize the importance

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.779
of our testimony, help us to consider the investment

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:03.179
of our time and the impact of our tongue.

00:46:03.179 --> 00:46:05.100
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would do work

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.019
in our hearts and lives.

00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:09.380
Help us, Lord, to be changed.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.820
I pray that as you've, this morning,

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.459
through your word, touched hearts,

00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:21.059
spoken of specific areas, God, we'd do business with you.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.220
We'd confess sin where we need to confess sin.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.980
We'd ask you for help where we need the help.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.339
God, we'd honor you.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.179
We'll thank you for each decision that's made

00:46:34.179 --> 00:46:35.579
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:35.579 --> 00:46:36.420
Would you stand with me?

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.059
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:46:38.059 --> 00:46:40.940
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.260
As she does, the altar's open.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.899
Maybe you wanna come and thank God for the gift of time.

00:46:45.899 --> 00:46:47.980
Maybe you wanna ask God to help you

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.420
as you consider your testimony,

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.100
the investment of your time, the impact of your tongue.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.660
Just ask God to help you in one way or another.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.700
Ask God to help you to be that witness

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.779
that would cause people to want more.

00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:03.980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
