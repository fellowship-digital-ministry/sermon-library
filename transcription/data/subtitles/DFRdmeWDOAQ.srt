1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Genesis chapter number 15, and for quite some time on Sunday evenings, we have been studying

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,159
through the book of Genesis.

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:13,159
Of course, every once in a while, as the Lord would lead, we'll take a diversion and go

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,279
to another portion of Scripture.

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,159
And the last time that we were in the book of Genesis, we looked at Genesis chapter 15

6
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,000
and verse number 1.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,959
And as we looked at Genesis 15 and verse number 1, I titled the message, A Memorable Greeting.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:32,040
And as we looked at the verse of Scripture and we understand really the context of what

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,159
had taken place in Genesis chapter number 14, you read the first verse of Genesis 15

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:45,520
and you are encouraged greatly and you have to come to the conclusion that Abram was encouraged

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,099
greatly as to hear these words from the Lord.

12
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:55,279
The Bible says this in verse number 1 of Genesis 15, after these things, the word of the Lord

13
00:00:55,279 --> 00:01:04,260
came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield and thy exceeding

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,620
great reward.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,900
You'll remember that in chapter number 14, there was a coalition of forces that came

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,860
and they were victorious in their attempt to conquer.

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,779
And of course, we find that Lot was one that was taken captive and Abram receives word

18
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,459
as to what has taken place.

19
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:28,699
And Abram goes with those men from his own house, his armed trained servants, and he

20
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:33,339
takes them and they pursue after and God gives victory.

21
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:39,839
And after that victory and after they recover all things, we find that there were two encounters

22
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:41,180
that Abram has.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,040
The first was with the king of Salem, Melchizedek.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,419
And what a blessing for Abram to have the opportunity to speak with the king of Salem

25
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:57,220
and how that the meeting, the discussion between Abram and the king of Salem, Melchizedek,

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,099
prepared Abram for the meeting that he would have with the king of Sodom.

27
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,580
And how we mentioned it's so important for us to spend time with the Lord and to be in

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,500
his word and to commune with him and how that we daily spend time in walking with our God

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,740
and he prepares us for the events that we will face in our day.

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,179
And we see exactly that in Genesis chapter number 14.

31
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:25,539
Remember it was Melchizedek that said that he was the priest of the most high God, El

32
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,539
Elyon.

33
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:31,500
And it's the first mention of that name of God in all of the scriptures that he is the

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,020
most high God.

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,740
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

36
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,539
And what a blessing to see how God would reveal that truth to Abram through that encounter

37
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,059
with Melchizedek.

38
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:50,139
And then when Sodom comes, the king of Sodom, excuse me, when he comes and he offers to

39
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:57,139
give some goods to Abram, Abram replies and says, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

40
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,940
the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,460
And we spoke about the significance of that because the reality is that had he not just

42
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,699
met with Melchizedek, the king of Salem, he would have had no knowledge of what he shared

43
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,940
in response to the offer of the king of Sodom.

44
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,860
It was through that meeting that God revealed this truth about himself so that Abram would

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,059
be prepared, adequately prepared to be able to answer this king of Sodom.

46
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:34,139
Of course, there's the potential as you look at all that takes place, how that there was

47
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,020
the potential for that coalition to regroup and maybe attack again and so on and so forth.

48
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:45,740
I'm sure they weren't too excited about the fact that Abram came and recovered all and

49
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:52,179
maybe they'd go back and regroup and devise a new plan, a new strategy on how they would

50
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:53,179
go back.

51
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:59,619
And God appears to Abram and he says, first of all, fear not.

52
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,699
There's a lot of fear nots in the Bible.

53
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,380
Fear thou not, fear not, be not afraid.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:13,300
I'm so thankful that God has given us into Abram in this greeting in verse number one,

55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,260
he begins by saying, fear not, Abram.

56
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,700
You know, God is telling us to not fear.

57
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,859
We don't need to be afraid.

58
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:27,299
And we've, of course, finished up our study in the book of Hebrews and in our previous

59
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:32,859
couple of studies as we finished the 13th chapter, we were mindful of what we are told

60
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:38,220
in verse number six, where the Bible says that we might boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

61
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,260
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

62
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,380
Of course, the end of verse number five, that great promise when the scriptures remind us

63
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,140
that our God is ever present.

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,019
He said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

65
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,519
He says to Abram, don't be afraid, fear not, Abram.

66
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,980
And then he gives them two additional truths that are impactful.

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,859
He says, number one, I am thy shield.

68
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:04,859
We think about a shield.

69
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:09,019
And of course, we think about the protection that a shield would offer to an individual.

70
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,700
When we think about God himself, now you notice in your Bible, it says after these things,

71
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,019
the word of the Lord, it's all caps, it's Jehovah or Yahweh.

72
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,820
His name that is, of course, revealed throughout the scriptures, the proper name of God.

73
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,299
He's saying to Abram, I am thy shield.

74
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:35,140
I'm so thankful this evening to know that our God gives protection, that he is able

75
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,799
to protect, that he is our shield, our buckler.

76
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,179
And we find that Abram would be reminded of this truth.

77
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:51,380
And then he says, and thy exceeding great reward.

78
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,619
See Abram was offered some things from Sodom and he refused those things because he says,

79
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:02,820
I lift up mine eyes, or my hand, excuse me, unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,459
of heaven and earth, king of Sodom, I don't need what you're offering me.

81
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,179
And he's refused that which had been offered.

82
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:14,619
And then God comes and says, I am thy exceeding great reward.

83
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm so thankful.

84
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,500
We sing the song, now I belong to Jesus.

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,179
Jesus belongs to me, right?

86
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:27,339
I mean, what a joy to know him as our personal Lord and savior, to understand that he is

87
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,500
our exceeding great reward.

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,980
Listen, there are a lot of people around the world today that are seeking all sorts of

89
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,820
things to bring satisfaction.

90
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,420
And there are people even within the broad category of Christendom that are looking to

91
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,940
find satisfaction through things, but we must understand that God is our exceeding great

92
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
reward.

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,380
And really, you know, he's all we need.

94
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,579
And we find that he supplies all of our needs and what a blessing to know the Lord.

95
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:04,739
After we find this interaction that begins in verse number one, the very beginning of

96
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,500
verse number two says, and Abram said, and so in the next few verses, we're going to

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,899
have the opportunity, we will be privileged to read really a discussion that takes place

98
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,220
between the Lord God Almighty and Abram.

99
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,579
And we find that Abram had introduced, had been introduced through this greeting with

100
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,820
these powerful truths, fear not, I am thy shield, I am thy exceeding great reward.

101
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,980
And then Abram responds to the Lord and we'll be looking this evening at verses two through

102
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,459
six in particular.

103
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,019
Notice the Bible says this in verse number two, and Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou

104
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:50,420
give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus.

105
00:07:50,420 --> 00:08:00,260
And Abram said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed and lo, one born in my house is mine

106
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
heir.

107
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,859
The title for the message this evening is from verse number three, where Abram says,

108
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:09,940
to me thou hast given no seed.

109
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,380
To me thou hast given no seed.

110
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,179
Here in Genesis 15 verses two through six, notice with me number one, if you're taking

111
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:23,660
notes from verses two and three, I find that Abram's perspective is revealed.

112
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,299
Abram's perspective is revealed.

113
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:29,100
You know, the reality is that each of us have a perspective on things that we encounter,

114
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,940
things that we go through in life.

115
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,200
And sometimes if we would be honest, our perspective is wrong.

116
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,559
Sometimes our perspective needs to have some correction.

117
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,119
And we'll see that that's the case with Abram here this evening.

118
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:47,640
But Abram reveals his perspective to the Lord, and through this conversation and through

119
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,979
the opportunity that we have by it being recorded in the Word of God, we have the privilege

120
00:08:53,979 --> 00:09:00,080
of looking at this discussion and really seeing the perspective of this man, Abram.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,260
I find this evening that as I look at verses two and three, that Abram is a man that is

122
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,900
very transparent with the Lord.

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,299
Abram is a man that's coming and he's looking at what's taking place and we find that he's

124
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,340
sharing his heart, he's pouring out his heart and his concern to the Lord.

125
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,700
And I think that's important for us to understand this evening.

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,179
We see it throughout the Psalms when the psalmist is extremely transparent and shares his heart

127
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,179
with God.

128
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,580
You understand this evening that God knows your heart anyway.

129
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,659
But you know it does something for us when we're just transparent with God and we just

130
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,859
share our heart with God.

131
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:43,859
Abram is looking at this situation, he's received some promises we'll look at in just a moment,

132
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:49,739
and he's noticing the current situation and what he does in seeing this perspective being

133
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,719
revealed is, number one, he states the problem.

134
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,419
The problem is quite obvious.

135
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,419
He has no son.

136
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,979
He has no heir.

137
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,099
He has no son.

138
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,099
He says this in verse number two.

139
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,499
Lord God, what wilt Thou give me,

140
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,579
notice this,

141
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,179
seeing I go childless?"

142
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,259
Now, go back if you will a few chapters

143
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,339
in chapter 12,

144
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:14,279
and you say, why is Abraham,

145
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,099
of course, that's not his name yet,

146
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,439
it will be changed shortly,

147
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,019
but why is Abram asking this question?

148
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,799
Why is he stating this problem?

149
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,259
Why is it that he's saying,

150
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,259
what is it that Thou wilt give me

151
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,739
seeing I go childless?

152
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,179
Why is it that he says,

153
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,499
to me Thou hast given no seed?

154
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,139
Well, because in Genesis chapter 12,

155
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:33,979
in verse number one,

156
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:34,819
the Bible says,

157
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,819
and the Lord had said unto Abram,

158
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,339
get thee out of thy country

159
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,419
and from thy kindred

160
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,779
and from thy father's house

161
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,219
unto a land that I will show thee,

162
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,259
and I will make of thee a great nation,

163
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,699
and I will bless thee,

164
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,219
and I will make thy name great,

165
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:50,379
and thou shalt be a blessing.

166
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,019
No doubt from verse number two

167
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,379
of Genesis chapter number 12

168
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,419
that Abram would understand

169
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,719
that there would be a son,

170
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,879
a child that would be given

171
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,839
when God says,

172
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,159
I will bless thee,

173
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,999
I will make of thee a great nation.

174
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,279
Verse number seven,

175
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,879
and the Lord appeared unto Abram

176
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,879
and said unto thy seed

177
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,599
will I give this land.

178
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,359
And there builded he an altar

179
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:16,579
unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

180
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,879
We find that God gives him this promise

181
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,839
in verse number seven of Genesis 12,

182
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,319
and he says this,

183
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,799
he says unto thy seed

184
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,199
will I give this land.

185
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,479
Abram builds an altar,

186
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,079
he worships the Lord,

187
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,759
he responds in proper manner,

188
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,599
but yet we find that this promise

189
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,959
that is given in verse number seven

190
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,199
of chapter number 12,

191
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,879
when we come to chapter 15,

192
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,499
Abram's saying it's not happened yet.

193
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,279
We find that in chapter number 13,

194
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,999
look there in verses 15 and 16,

195
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,279
it's repeated what we just read

196
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,639
in Genesis 12 and verse number seven.

197
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,339
Here in Genesis 13 and verse number 15,

198
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,039
the Bible says for all the land

199
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,479
which thou seest,

200
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,279
to thee will I give it,

201
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,559
notice the next phrase,

202
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,639
and to thy seed forever.

203
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,999
Now you'll remember with me

204
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,359
as we study Genesis chapter number 13,

205
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:11,199
that here is the division between Abram and Lot.

206
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,559
Remember there was some discord,

207
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,979
there was some contention,

208
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,999
some strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle

209
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,999
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.

210
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,299
And Abram says listen,

211
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,539
this isn't good for us

212
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,239
and we need to separate.

213
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,279
He tells Lot you go ahead and you pick

214
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,119
and Lot picks and he goes towards Sodom.

215
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,959
We see and we understand that.

216
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,179
And the Bible tells us

217
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,679
that the men there were wicked

218
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,679
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

219
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,239
And Abram, he took that which was left,

220
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,599
he took that land

221
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,799
and he had given the option to Lot.

222
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,519
We find here that God then speaks to Abram

223
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,919
beginning in verse number 14.

224
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,119
And the Lord said unto Abram

225
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,839
after that Lot was separated from him

226
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,319
and you notice what he says,

227
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,359
that he was going to give him the land

228
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,239
and to thy seed forever.

229
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,279
Notice what he says in verse number 16.

230
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,159
And I will make thy seed

231
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,559
as the dust of the earth.

232
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,119
So that if a man can number the dust of the earth,

233
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:13,279
then shall thy seed also be numbered.

234
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,239
Do you see why Abram acknowledges a problem?

235
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,319
He's been given this promise.

236
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,399
In chapter number 12 in verses one and two

237
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,319
and verse number seven,

238
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:25,479
again in chapter number 13 in verses 15 and 16,

239
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,879
God has spoken to Abram

240
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,359
and God has told Abram

241
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,759
about making of thee a great nation

242
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,839
of you having this land and thy seed.

243
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,359
And yet Abram is saying,

244
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,239
I go childless.

245
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,519
I don't have a son.

246
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,119
There's no seed.

247
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,599
And so we have a problem

248
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,119
and we find that Abram

249
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,319
in offering not only the problem,

250
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:56,439
he really begins to offer a solution.

251
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,799
We notice in verses two and three again

252
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,839
of chapter 15,

253
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,119
notice what he says

254
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:04,559
and you see his perspective in verse number two,

255
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,759
he says, seeing I go childless

256
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,679
and then notice what he says

257
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,999
at the end of verse number two,

258
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,999
and the steward of my house

259
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,799
is this Eleazar of Damascus.

260
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,239
And Abram said,

261
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:19,719
behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

262
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:24,719
And lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

263
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,079
And so what is Abram saying?

264
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,799
He's saying, listen, God,

265
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,839
you've given me this promise.

266
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,799
I don't have a seed.

267
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,839
I don't have a child.

268
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,119
I go childless.

269
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,679
And so what about this one

270
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,039
that's been born in my house?

271
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,759
What about him being the heir?

272
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,759
What about that being the solution to the problem?

273
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,559
And I look at that and I say,

274
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,279
really, if we'd be honest this evening,

275
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,599
if we were in Abram's shoes,

276
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,039
we might come to the same conclusion.

277
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,959
We might come to the same perspective

278
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,759
that Abram has.

279
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,079
We understand as we go through the Scriptures,

280
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,079
Abram's not a young man

281
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,719
and he's getting more and more age

282
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,399
with each passing day.

283
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,999
And he's saying, I don't have a child.

284
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,199
I haven't had a child,

285
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,279
but God's given me these promises.

286
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,439
And as he's noticing,

287
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,719
he's analyzing the situation,

288
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,919
his perspective is being revealed to us

289
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,079
because he knows there's a problem.

290
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,719
He says here's a potential solution.

291
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,839
You know what the problem is with this solution?

292
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,759
It's the same problem that sometimes we have

293
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,999
with our solutions that we offer God.

294
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:29,599
They're by sight and not by faith.

295
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,839
It's a sight solution.

296
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
What do I mean by that?

297
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,279
Well, here's one that can fit the bill.

298
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,879
I got this one that's been born in my house

299
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,199
and he can be my heir.

300
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,319
And see, again, if we could understand this evening

301
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,999
and we could put ourselves into the shoes of Abram,

302
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,239
perhaps we too would come to the similar conclusion.

303
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:58,559
We say, Lord, how long do we have to wait for this?

304
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,879
Lord, I know You've promised this.

305
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,919
You said that You were going to make of me a great nation.

306
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,359
You said that this land was going to be

307
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,519
not only for me, but for my seed forever.

308
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
But I go childless.

309
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,719
And so Lord, one born in mine house,

310
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,919
he says this in verse number three,

311
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,839
is mine heir.

312
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,639
And I believe that it's a sight answer

313
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,799
and not a faith answer.

314
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,439
So we see number one, Abram's perspective revealed.

315
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,799
Number two, if you're taking notes in verses four and five,

316
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,999
notice with me God's promise explained.

317
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,519
I'm so thankful that our God is clear and precise.

318
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,199
I'm so thankful that our God is patient.

319
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,839
Aren't you thankful that God's patient with you?

320
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,159
The Bible word is long-suffering.

321
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,319
And our God is long-suffering.

322
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,959
And our God, we could look at a whole host

323
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,799
of examples this evening,

324
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,519
and we could look at how there are times in our lives

325
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,959
even that we could model some of that

326
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,919
which is contained within the pages of Scripture

327
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,159
where we kind of don't have the faith

328
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,199
that we need to have

329
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,279
and we're not responding in the manner

330
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,239
in which we should,

331
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,279
and yet our God is long-suffering with us.

332
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,279
And you notice in the text of Scripture

333
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,599
that God speaks a matter of factly.

334
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,799
He speaks clear.

335
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,399
He explains some things to Abram

336
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:22,759
in the next couple of verses,

337
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,679
but you understand that He doesn't like reprimand him.

338
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,839
And our God is so gracious and so merciful.

339
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,199
And here's what God does.

340
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,999
Notice in verse number four,

341
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,839
it says this,

342
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,839
and behold, the word of the Lord came unto him saying,

343
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:46,519
this shall not be thine heir.

344
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,919
Now, is that hard to understand this evening?

345
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,239
Sometimes we get these kind of things

346
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,839
from several different places

347
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,879
where people say, well, you know,

348
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,679
the Bible's just hard to understand.

349
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,599
And the reality is that much of the Bible

350
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,599
is extremely easy to understand.

351
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,999
And yes, there are some passages

352
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,959
that are much more difficult to understand.

353
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,079
And that's why I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit of God,

354
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,399
who's the author of Scripture, lives within me.

355
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:14,039
And He's the teacher, amen?

356
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,479
But the reality is that God comes to Abram,

357
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,039
and He says, again,

358
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,239
when we look at the promise being explained,

359
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,879
we find that the Lord came unto him,

360
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:27,719
and God is going to give a clear and precise response

361
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,079
to what Abram says.

362
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,239
Remember, Abram's identified a problem.

363
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,440
He's even offered a solution,

364
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,479
but God says, no, this shall not be thine heir.

365
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,319
Abram, you have the wrong perspective,

366
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,719
and we need to correct that.

367
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,319
We need to change that.

368
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,880
You need to understand something.

369
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,679
This is what God is saying to Abram.

370
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,679
And I believe that as we look here at the Scriptures,

371
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,000
that God is going to give Abram some truth

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,719
that Abram would have to then respond to.

373
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,719
And I want you to hold onto that thought

374
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
as we kind of go through the message this evening,

375
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,839
because the reality is that God has given us truth

376
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,000
that we need to respond to.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,880
We've often said, and we've mentioned it

378
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,759
throughout the years,

379
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,479
that faith is simply taking God at His word,

380
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,559
that we believe God.

381
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,479
And here, Abram comes and his perspective is revealed,

382
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,119
but now God's promise is being explained,

383
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,279
and he says this,

384
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,519
not only is he going to dismiss

385
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,759
the potential solution that Abram has offered,

386
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,759
but he's going to once again rehearse with specific details

387
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,079
the promise that he's making.

388
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,359
Notice what he says.

389
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,799
This shall not be thine heir, verse number four,

390
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,319
but he that shall come forth

391
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,319
out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

392
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,919
Again, isn't that hard to understand?

393
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,839
No, it's quite clear, is it not?

394
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,679
Abram.

395
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,839
Abram, I know that you go childless.

396
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,459
See, you understand this evening

397
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,799
that God knows all things.

398
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,079
He's got perfect knowledge.

399
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,799
He's omniscient.

400
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,519
When Abram comes to God in v. 2

401
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,039
saying, I go childless,

402
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,579
that wasn't a surprise to God.

403
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:18,339
He knew that already.

404
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,919
But again, Abram is being transparent with the Lord.

405
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,879
He's concerned about this current situation.

406
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,439
He's received the promise.

407
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,839
He doesn't know how God's going to do

408
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,359
all that God said He was going to do.

409
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,159
And so he's offering the solution

410
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,079
and God says, no, Abram,

411
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,319
that's not the way it's going to work.

412
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,119
God says, he that shall come forth

413
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,439
out of thine own bowels

414
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:47,239
shall be thine heir.

415
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:51,439
I'm so thankful for the clarity of God's Word.

416
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:54,359
And that God spoke to Abram

417
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,599
in very clear language

418
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,719
as to what this promise would be.

419
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,599
Notice in v. 5, God then takes

420
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,519
and it says this,

421
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,719
and He brought him forth abroad

422
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:09,319
and said, look now toward heaven.

423
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,719
Now obviously, as we look at the context

424
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,079
of the passage of Scripture that is before us,

425
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,999
it was evening time.

426
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,199
It was dark.

427
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,799
And God says to Abram,

428
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,839
look toward heaven

429
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,399
and tell the stars.

430
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:30,039
In other words, it means to count the stars.

431
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,479
That's what that phraseology means.

432
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,039
And tell the stars.

433
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,839
Now I stepped out on the porch this evening

434
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,279
before the service to just look up

435
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,599
into the heavens.

436
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,959
And it's a little bit of an overcast

437
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:40,919
kind of an evening.

438
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,959
It's supposed to rain later this evening.

439
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,439
But last night, it was a pretty clear evening.

440
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,119
And Joseph and I were driving home

441
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,799
with Carter, my nephew,

442
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,959
and they noticed how bright the moon was.

443
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,359
It was just about a full moon last night.

444
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,359
And it was beautiful.

445
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,719
It was clear.

446
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,599
And I can't help but think,

447
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,839
see, for us this evening,

448
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,999
if it were a clear evening

449
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,479
as it was last night,

450
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,399
you can see a number of stars

451
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:11,079
in the heavens.

452
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,079
But if you've ever been to a place

453
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,519
where there's not as many people

454
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,879
and there's not as much light,

455
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,239
you can see, and pollution by the way,

456
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,919
another thing that kind of messes with

457
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,199
the number of stars you can see.

458
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:27,000
You go out and you see the stars

459
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and it's like, man, I didn't know

460
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,079
there were this many stars.

461
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,719
Holly and I, almost 10 years ago,

462
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,599
we went to Arizona for our anniversary.

463
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,919
And I remember that evening,

464
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,439
I think it was the first evening we were there,

465
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,439
going on a walk.

466
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,839
And I was a little bit apprehensive.

467
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,599
Pierre, they told me there were rattlesnakes there.

468
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,839
And so you're walking at night

469
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,319
and I'm kind of, you know,

470
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,559
I'm looking down instead of up.

471
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,039
But you just got to a point

472
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,559
where you began to look up into the heavens.

473
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,639
And it's like, man, you don't see stars like this

474
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,239
around the big cities.

475
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,519
And God says, now think about when

476
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,839
this is being written several thousand years ago, right?

477
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,799
Abram is there and God says,

478
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,199
look toward heaven and tell the stars

479
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:20,959
if thou be able to number them.

480
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:23,439
Have you ever tried to count the stars?

481
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,359
There are people that have attempted to do such tasks.

482
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:33,599
The reality is that they're numberless.

483
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,599
The reality this evening is that

484
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,199
we're mindful of what God said to us in Genesis,

485
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,719
and I love it, in Genesis 1-16,

486
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:44,879
where the last five words of the verse of Scripture

487
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:49,399
says He made the stars also.

488
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:50,959
And in making these stars,

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,719
He made an innumerable host of stars

490
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:58,079
and He spread them through the heavens

491
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,439
and through the galaxies.

492
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,079
And we find here this evening

493
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,239
that Abram is taken by God

494
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,799
and He leads them out and He says,

495
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,399
Abram, I want you to look toward heaven.

496
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,639
And He says, Abram, tell the stars

497
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:14,239
if thou be able to number them.

498
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,479
And He said unto him,

499
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,479
God is speaking to Abram and He says unto him,

500
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:25,399
so shall thy seed be.

501
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,320
Wow.

502
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I mean, when we really begin to look at

503
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,440
this promise being explained by God to Abram

504
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,079
and we understand this evening

505
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,119
that our God is omnipotent,

506
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,959
that our God is able to do all things,

507
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,000
and the reality tonight is that

508
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,559
because of having the whole canon of Scripture,

509
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,479
there's a whole lot that we know about God

510
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,160
that Abram has not yet learned about God

511
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,440
in this particular text of Scripture.

512
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,600
And we've learned names of God

513
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,679
that are revealed to Abram after this account.

514
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,160
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

515
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,079
God's not revealed Himself to Abram

516
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,079
at this point in that matter,

517
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,919
but we have the whole canon of Scripture

518
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,320
so we know that He shortly will do so.

519
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,639
And we find that as we look at this book

520
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,399
and we look at the promises contained therein,

521
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,239
that we stand in awe of who our God is

522
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,359
and we see how that God

523
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,919
who has made this promise to Abram,

524
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
that He explains it to him.

525
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,639
He says, Abram, I understand that you're coming

526
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,239
with your problem and I understand

527
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,880
that you've even brought a solution,

528
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,919
but this one that's born in your house,

529
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,039
no, he's not going to be thine heir

530
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,320
because one that comes from your own bowels,

531
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
he shall be thine heir.

532
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,399
He then gives him this wonderful example

533
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,320
and this teaching of the stars and the heavens,

534
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,720
and he says at the end of the verse,

535
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,440
so shall thy seed be.

536
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,639
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 1

537
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,799
in verse 20,

538
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,239
with regard to the promises of God,

539
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:10,399
it says, for all the promises of God in him are yea,

540
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,959
and in him, amen,

541
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,559
unto the glory of God by us.

542
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
We find that Peter would make this statement

543
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,320
that we have been given exceeding great

544
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,759
and precious promises.

545
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,799
And we have.

546
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,160
One of the great hymns of the faith

547
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,239
that we sing,

548
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,199
standing on the promises.

549
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,880
And we sing that song,

550
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,399
and when we sing it,

551
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,759
I hope that our minds are thinking about

552
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,720
and aware of the promises that God has given us

553
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,519
and we find that God has explained

554
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,359
some of the promises in detail

555
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,880
such as He has to Abram in this passage of Scripture.

556
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,079
And we find that He's given us these promises.

557
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,720
We're familiar with various portions of Scripture

558
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,359
and how that God in His grace and His mercy

559
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,880
would work with His people

560
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,079
and He would begin to give them

561
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:10,119
and reveal to them the truth of who He is.

562
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,440
And He didn't always explain to them

563
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:15,079
how He would do what He would do,

564
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,160
but He simply promised to do it.

565
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,039
There are times in which the people of God

566
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,759
would hesitate and they would have

567
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,959
some level of doubt and unbelief

568
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,239
and God would come alongside them

569
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,799
and begin to prove Himself.

570
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
And I think this evening of Gideon,

571
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,000
and I love the account of Gideon in Judges 6-8

572
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,479
and how God would build the faith of Gideon

573
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:43,399
by revealing to him and showing him,

574
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,320
yes, you are going to be used of Me

575
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,119
to bring victory to My people.

576
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,720
It's a blessing.

577
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,320
And we have this precious book that sits before us

578
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,839
and we have the opportunity to read it

579
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,919
and to be encouraged by it.

580
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,039
And when we look at the promises of God's Word

581
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,279
and we consider this one tonight to Abram

582
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,079
and we find how God would explain the promise,

583
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:13,000
we ought to rejoice alongside Abram tonight.

584
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,039
I find myself thinking,

585
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,720
even as I'm turning here to the book of Numbers

586
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,839
and thinking about the scenario

587
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,479
in which Balaam was seeking to curse

588
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,519
the nation of Israel.

589
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,959
And of course, Balak's anger was kindled

590
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,160
against Balaam and all of that.

591
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,839
And you find that the Bible says this

592
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,559
in verse number 19 of chapter 23 of the book of Numbers,

593
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,119
God is not a man that he should lie,

594
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,200
neither the son of man that he should repent.

595
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,320
Hath he said, and shall he not do it?

596
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,679
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

597
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,080
Can I tell you this evening,

598
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,359
and I know that we know this,

599
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,320
but God has never failed on one promise

600
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,399
that He's ever given.

601
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
He just never has.

602
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,559
And you understand this evening that He never will.

603
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,839
There's not one promise that God is not going to fulfill.

604
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:12,279
We can be encouraged this evening

605
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,200
as we understand again,

606
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,919
even as we read the Scriptures

607
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,080
and study the accounts of God's Word,

608
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,559
where we have the privilege many times

609
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,719
of knowing the end of the story, so to speak.

610
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:26,919
And we know in just a few chapters

611
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,760
that we're going to have the opportunity

612
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,640
to read about the birth of Isaac.

613
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,359
We understand that God is going to fulfill the promise

614
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,960
that He had given to Abram on this particular day, evening,

615
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,399
as God would recount these things to Abram.

616
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:45,520
We can read that and we understand that,

617
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,559
but Abram was just living life like we are,

618
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,440
day by day, moment by moment.

619
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,960
And so Abram had really, I would say it this way,

620
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,719
Abram had a decision to make.

621
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:05,119
Chapter 15 begins with a greeting that's a memorable greeting.

622
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,359
We then read of this discussion, if you will,

623
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,119
and Abram bringing his concern before the Lord,

624
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,319
the Lord responding to Abram,

625
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,039
and now it's up to Abram to respond.

626
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,539
It's up to Abram to do something with that which he's just heard.

627
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:28,799
You know, the reality is that just as Abram is here in this text of Scripture,

628
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:32,559
each of us every day when we go to the Word of God,

629
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,799
every day that we go to church and hear the preaching of the Word of God,

630
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,359
we have a decision to make.

631
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,119
What are we going to do with what we've received?

632
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,079
What will we do with the message that we heard at church?

633
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,359
What will we do with the message that we heard in our youth ministry,

634
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,559
in our Sunday school class, in our junior church class?

635
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,839
What do we do?

636
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,479
Listen, we're seeking to bring somebody to a place of decision.

637
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,879
What do we do with it?

638
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:04,479
Tomorrow morning when you read your Bible,

639
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,479
when you get up in the morning and you open up the Word of God

640
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,279
and you begin to read what thus saith the Lord,

641
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:15,679
you have a decision to make with regard to what you read.

642
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,799
And every day, we're faced with those decisions.

643
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,999
And Abram is in a similar position that we find ourselves in on a regular basis.

644
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:29,839
And I want you to notice that Abram's perspective is revealed,

645
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,399
God's promise is explained,

646
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,599
and if you're taking notes in verse number six, God's promise is embraced.

647
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,319
I'm so thankful for verse number six,

648
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,239
where the Bible says,

649
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:49,679
and he believed in the Lord.

650
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,759
He believed.

651
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,159
Remember, we've said, I mentioned it just a few moments ago,

652
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,599
that faith is taking God in His Word.

653
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,479
Faith is believing God.

654
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:04,359
Listen, I don't maybe understand all of how it's going to work,

655
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,079
I don't understand how it's all going to come together,

656
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,399
but I know that God has repeated and explained this promise

657
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,599
in very clear and precise terms,

658
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,319
and therefore I have to respond in my response.

659
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,799
Abram's response is, I believe God.

660
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,999
I just believe.

661
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:29,279
It says this, that he believed in the Lord.

662
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,479
He believed in the Lord.

663
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,639
I wonder this evening,

664
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:38,159
how many times we can go to the Word of God,

665
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,159
and read of those that did not believe what God told them.

666
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,559
Oh, there are many examples.

667
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,719
Perhaps this evening we can go to positive examples of others that did believe.

668
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,439
They just believed that God would work,

669
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,079
that God would show Himself mighty,

670
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,319
that God would do what He only could do.

671
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,279
I know that I often make the reference to the passage in Acts 27.

672
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,639
It's been so impactful in my own life,

673
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:13,839
and I've been so challenged through the declaration of the Apostle Paul

674
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,839
when they're in the midst of the terrible storm on the sea,

675
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:19,199
and all hope that they would be saved is gone,

676
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,079
and they've not seen the stars,

677
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,439
and I mean, they just were wishing for the day,

678
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,519
and there's just no hope.

679
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,239
God sent an angel to speak,

680
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:34,319
and the Lord gave Paul truth with regard to their deliverance,

681
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,999
and Paul simply declares to those other individuals that are on that boat,

682
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:43,159
I believe God,

683
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,159
that it shall be as it's been told to me.

684
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,119
And we just come to that place in our lives as Abram does,

685
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,639
where he embraces the promise,

686
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,159
and I believe this evening that this first half of verse number 6

687
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,359
is a powerful statement of Scripture.

688
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,119
I believe that this first statement of Genesis 15 and verse number 6

689
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,599
not only is a powerful statement of Scripture,

690
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,439
but it's a powerful testimony of Abram.

691
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,359
That Abram believed God.

692
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,599
He hears what God says.

693
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,759
Remember, it begins with this perspective of I go childless,

694
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:21,199
I mean, I don't have any seed, I don't have a son.

695
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,399
God, what are you going to do? How are you going to do this?

696
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:29,079
This one that's been born in my house, and he says,

697
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,119
here's what I'm going to do.

698
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,199
Here's my promise.

699
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,559
And Abram believes in the Lord.

700
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,719
He takes God in his word.

701
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,599
And it says this,

702
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:48,079
and he counted it to him for righteousness.

703
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,159
Wow, what a powerful truth of the Word of God.

704
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,399
And as we look at this statement at the end of Genesis 15 and verse number 6,

705
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:00,879
our minds will race to the New Testament

706
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:05,959
in which this particular truth is referenced on at least two occasions.

707
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:09,079
And I want you to think about what God is saying here.

708
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,319
We see the faith of Abram where he believed in the Lord,

709
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,719
but then we see the response of that,

710
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,639
the way in which God would respond.

711
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,879
And it says that he counted it to him for righteousness.

712
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:24,919
Go over to the book of Romans if you will.

713
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:34,599
In Romans chapter number 4,

714
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:44,399
look at the first three verses of Romans chapter number 4.

715
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:47,759
The Bible says this in verse number 1 of Romans 4,

716
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:51,319
What shall we say then that Abraham our father,

717
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,919
as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?

718
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,719
For if Abraham were justified by works,

719
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,919
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

720
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:06,479
Now, it's interesting when you read verse number 2 there

721
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:10,559
and you consider it with the truth that God gives us in Ephesians 2,

722
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,759
verses 8 and 9, in verse number 9 in particular,

723
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,879
where the Bible says, lest any man should boast.

724
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,919
Because the Bible says in Ephesians 2, 8 and 9,

725
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,359
For by grace are you saved through faith,

726
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,759
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

727
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:29,039
not of works, lest any man should boast.

728
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,959
What is he saying by that?

729
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,999
Well, if I could work my way to heaven,

730
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,599
I have whereof to glory, to boast.

731
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,919
And so in verse number 2 of Romans 4,

732
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,439
here's what Paul is saying to these believers.

733
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:44,159
He says, if Abraham were justified by works,

734
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,719
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

735
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,559
What is he meaning?

736
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,159
Well, he did enough good things to get to heaven.

737
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,199
But you understand you can't do enough good things

738
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,439
to get to heaven.

739
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:58,239
Because the Bible says that the gift of God

740
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,239
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

741
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,799
not by works of righteousness,

742
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:04,919
which we have done in Titus 3 and verse number 5.

743
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,039
We just looked at Ephesians 2, 8 and 9.

744
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,159
The Bible is abundantly clear

745
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:13,839
that salvation is by grace through faith alone.

746
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,839
Paul says later in the book of Galatians,

747
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,519
I do not frustrate the grace of God.

748
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,439
If righteousness came by the law,

749
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,479
then Christ is dead in vain.

750
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:28,279
Listen, His death was not vain.

751
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,319
His death was absolutely essential and required

752
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,919
to pay for your sin and my sin and the sin of the world.

753
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:34,739
Why?

754
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:36,119
Because your works can't do it.

755
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,999
And the law, keeping of the law can't do it.

756
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:41,879
He says in verse number three,

757
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,119
for what saith the Scripture,

758
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,479
by the way, it's always good to go to the Scripture.

759
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,319
Amen.

760
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,359
You understand some of the things

761
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,159
that were going on in the first century.

762
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,559
Jesus dealt with it often with the Pharisees

763
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,919
and the Sadducees and the scribes

764
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,199
and those religious leaders.

765
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,679
What about the tradition?

766
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,519
What do men say?

767
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,359
What do you do?

768
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,439
And how is this?

769
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:01,039
No, what does the Scripture say?

770
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,199
You do err not knowing the Scripture.

771
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,959
And we find that the appeal is given

772
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:11,239
to these believers in the book of Romans.

773
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,599
And Paul says this,

774
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,519
for what saith the Scripture?

775
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,359
Notice where it says,

776
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,559
Abraham believed God

777
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,559
and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

778
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,239
That's exactly the passage

779
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,799
that we've been looking at this evening

780
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,199
in Genesis 15 verses two through six,

781
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,599
in particular, zeroing in on verse number six.

782
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,439
Abraham believed in the Lord

783
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,559
and he counted it unto him for righteousness.

784
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,959
And we see here that Paul knew the Old Testament.

785
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,559
He goes back to the Old Testament.

786
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,039
He references the Old Testament.

787
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,839
He says, now to him that worketh

788
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,000
is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

789
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,119
In other words, if you could work

790
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,000
to get your way to heaven,

791
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,199
you're earning something.

792
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,479
But no, it's of grace.

793
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,879
Verse five, but to him that worketh not,

794
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:01,319
but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly,

795
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,039
his faith is counted for righteousness.

796
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,719
We could really look at the entirety

797
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,719
of Romans chapter number four.

798
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,879
We don't have time this evening to do that.

799
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,159
We could continue to go through

800
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:15,599
and just see how Paul is using with great wisdom

801
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,119
the truth of the Old Testament

802
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,559
to prove these truths with regard to salvation

803
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,559
and righteousness being by faith, not by works.

804
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,959
Go over to the book of Galatians, if you will,

805
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,559
in chapter number three.

806
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,839
Notice another reference to this same portion

807
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,839
of Scripture that we're looking at

808
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,319
in Genesis 15 this evening.

809
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:38,759
We'd find it in Galatians chapter number three.

810
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:43,759
Look with me, if you will, in verse number six.

811
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:46,479
Galatians three and verse number six.

812
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,679
Even as Abraham, what's it say?

813
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,679
Believed God, and it was accounted

814
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,199
to him for righteousness.

815
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,000
Oftentimes, we speak about the.

816
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,960
righteousness of our God and I'm so thankful for he hath made him to be sin

817
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,439
for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."

818
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:13,439
2nd Corinthians in chapter number 5 and we find here that the Bible's

819
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:18,399
speaking about this event in Genesis 15 in verse number 6 as Abraham

820
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:22,979
believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Notice that as we

821
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,920
continue to kind of pick our way through the third chapter of the book of

822
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,540
Galatians that the Bible says this in verse number 8 let's read verse 7 with

823
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:37,919
it, "...know you therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children

824
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:44,479
of Abraham." So we get a look at the entirety of this promise that is made in

825
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:50,040
Genesis chapter number 15 we find the fulfillment with the land and we've

826
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,799
talked about that in previous messages but now we think about the seed and

827
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:58,599
we'll find that as we study the New Testament that yes there's the truth of

828
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,799
Isaac being born the promised son and what a blessing and all that would be

829
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:08,559
entailed in that but the fullness of the the blessing and the fullness of the

830
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:15,160
promise is the fact that we are children of that we that have trust at Christ we

831
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,559
by faith are looked at as being the children of Abraham and it says in verse

832
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:27,480
number 8, "...and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through

833
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,800
faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations

834
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,680
be blessed." You understand that heathen there really is dealing with Gentiles so

835
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,440
then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham look down if you

836
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:53,120
will for sake of time to verse number 16 now to Abraham and his seed were the

837
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,480
promise made were the promises made notice what it says here in verse number

838
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:08,399
16 and he saith not and to seeds plural as of many but as of one and to thy seed

839
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:16,679
notice these last three verses which is Christ see the messianic line we talk

840
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,800
about that often and we look at the book of Genesis and we've just developed the

841
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,440
truth that God is giving us all the way in Genesis chapter number three about

842
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,320
the fact that Messiah would come and the truth of the the the messianic line and

843
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,080
how that the enemy Satan and you can study not only the book of Genesis but

844
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,360
throughout the Old Testament how that the enemy sought to destroy the line so

845
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,240
that Messiah would not be able to come but our God is greater and here we find

846
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,039
that as God is giving this instruction to Abraham and he's giving this promise

847
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,639
to Abraham he say in thy seed and we understand the New Testament that thy

848
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,119
seed which is Christ now we understand that it would be thousands of years

849
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,199
later before that would come to its fullness in the promise but the

850
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,679
immediate fulfillment would be in the birth of Isaac and from there you go

851
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:13,399
through the line and the of Messiah and eventually you can read of course in the

852
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,960
New Testament you can read about the genealogies and all of those things and

853
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,160
what a tremendous blessing it is to understand that we find that the Bible

854
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,199
says that he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness

855
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:35,600
I'm so thankful that God's promise was embraced by Abram we understand the

856
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,440
account of Abram in fact we'll finish up chapter 15 and then get into chapter 16

857
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,600
and we notice there's some really some sad events that are recorded for us in

858
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,720
Genesis chapter number 16 and we'll look through those things and we'll see all

859
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:52,679
that's taking place but we rejoice this evening and what the Bible tells us

860
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:59,639
about him Abram responding to what God had given him and explained to him so my

861
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,759
question this evening as we look at the fullness of this and we really see not

862
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:08,199
only the immediate but of course as we see where it says so shall thy seed be

863
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,399
and how he told him in that if thou can tell the stars that they'll be able to

864
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:17,760
number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and we see the of

865
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,720
course the many descendants of Abram Abraham but then we think about the

866
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,040
truth of the the New Testament there in the book of Galatians with believers

867
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,760
being of the seed of Abraham I mean that number just grows exponentially at that

868
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,279
point we begin to see how that God has fulfilled that which he has promised to

869
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:45,239
do listen Christ came just as it had been prophesied this evening we see a

870
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:50,760
specific event in the life of Abram we see a specific promise we see a specific

871
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,480
situation I wonder tonight maybe there's been some promise that God has given you

872
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,359
in his word that maybe you've struggled with maybe there's been a measure of

873
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,679
doubt maybe there's been a measure of uncertainty maybe there's been some

874
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:14,239
unbelief if you will where you've read the promise you've you've seen what God

875
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,359
says in his word but there's just some difficulty with you being able to see

876
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,760
how it's going to come to fruition and you've struggled and you've dealt with

877
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,440
some difficulties and I would submit to you this evening if you're in that

878
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,679
position and you know that there's some promises that God has given in his word

879
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:38,880
and you're just struggling with it we're all human beings we understand that the

880
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,079
children of Israel when Moses sent those spies they came back and they didn't

881
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,720
believe God amen those ten spies they brought back an evil report and they

882
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,000
persuaded the entire congregation of the nation of Israel to doubt what God said

883
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,480
that God would do and we find that God would speak to a bro to Moses excuse me

884
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,839
and he would say how long will it be error my people believe me you

885
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:15,920
understand this evening that God wants us to believe him and he says this in

886
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,760
that same conversation with Moses he says for all the signs which I have

887
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,440
showed among them one of this evening when we look at this book and we study

888
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,040
it we read it and we see all the promises and the fulfillments and the

889
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,399
way our God works and what he does oh man we ought to embrace the promises I

890
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:41,000
mean more eagerly and readily even than those that we read of in the scriptures

891
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,640
why because we have so much more we have the whole of the scripture in this

892
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,519
evening I don't know the specific situation I don't know the specific

893
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:57,519
promise but maybe there's a promise that that we know in our heart the Holy

894
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,239
Spirit can can just kind of put his finger so to speak on that thing in our

895
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:04,920
own life and so you know you're not you're not believing me in this

896
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,040
situation your faith is not what it needs to be your there's a measure of

897
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,559
doubt and will you just believe God will you just take God at his word will you

898
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:22,480
just prove him and allow God to be exalted and allowed God to be magnified

899
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,079
see that's really the beauty of seeing God fulfill promises is that he gets the

900
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,880
glory it's not for us to take any level of credit for or recognition of those

901
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,600
things that happen but no we just see God working and we see God exalted in

902
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,760
God magnified and we just come to the place where we say I believe God I just

903
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,399
believe God I refuse to believe what the what the crowd wants to tell us I

904
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:57,920
refuse to believe what the the media wants to tell whoever I just refuse why

905
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,079
because I just want to believe God I just want to believe God and when you

906
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,279
come to that place in your life where you just believe God sometimes people

907
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:09,600
gonna look at you like you're crazy because why because you have faith in

908
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,399
what God has said and when you have that faith and what God has said and in

909
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:20,559
God is pleased with your faith with your belief we find that God will work in

910
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:27,600
amazing ways this evening there's a very specific conversation that takes place

911
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,440
between Abram and God I'm thankful that Abram was transparent maybe somebody

912
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,599
just need to be transparent with God tonight God I know you said this but I'm

913
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:44,479
struggling because of I go childless right that's what Abram said there's I

914
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:49,119
don't have a son and whatever the promises in your life you say I just

915
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,400
don't know I don't see it and we're transparent with God and we pour our

916
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,880
heart out before the Lord and we let God minister to us and we let him take his

917
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,960
word and perhaps lead us to some other portions and passages of Scripture that

918
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:10,239
would just minister to us and help us to just grow our faith we'd leave saying

919
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:17,799
God I believe you I just believe you I don't have to know how see sometimes I'm

920
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:23,200
guilty of wanting to know how I don't know if you are but a lot of times in my

921
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,919
life I'm guilty of wanting to know how how's it gonna happen how's it gonna

922
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:28,400
come together Holly can tell you that in the kitchen she's mixing things together

923
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,239
putting a meal together and I'm like man I don't know if I'm gonna eat that

924
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:40,880
but it comes together and it's great our God is amazing at bringing all these

925
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,640
things together and working them all together and saying I'm just gonna prove

926
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,799
myself I'm gonna show you my child what I'm able to do and all we need to do is

927
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:55,520
just believe them just believe them let's pray father we love you this

928
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,080
evening we thank you so much for loving us thank

929
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,280
We thank You for this account in Genesis 15

930
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,400
of this discussion between Abram and Yourself.

931
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,700
We thank You that

932
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:19,920
You explained Your promise in detail.

933
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,880
We thank You for Your clarity.

934
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,120
Lord, how we rejoice in the response of Abram.

935
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,480
Lord, I just pray tonight

936
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,920
that You'd help us.

937
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
I understand the account that is before us

938
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,000
is a specific situation for Abram.

939
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,160
But God, Your Word is full of promises for us

940
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,200
as Your children.

941
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,720
And if we'd be honest tonight,

942
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,160
there are times in which we stagger at Your promises,

943
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,080
that we struggle,

944
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,520
that we have doubt,

945
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,560
that we fail to exercise faith in what You've said,

946
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,440
perhaps even explaining or justifying.

947
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,280
But God, I pray tonight

948
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,360
that as only You can,

949
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,920
You would minister to each of us.

950
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,640
Challenge us.

951
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,760
Comfort us.

952
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,840
Help us, God, to simply believe You,

953
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
trust You,

954
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
and obey You.

955
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,360
I pray that in these next few moments

956
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,440
that the Holy Spirit of God would have His will in way,

957
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,640
that decisions would be made that would please Thee,

958
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,760
that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ

959
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,760
and impact eternity.

960
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,960
We'll be careful to give You the glory for all that You'll do.

961
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,440
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
