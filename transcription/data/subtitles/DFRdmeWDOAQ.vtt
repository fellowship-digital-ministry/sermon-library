00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
Genesis chapter number 15, and for quite some time on Sunday evenings, we have been studying

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.159
through the book of Genesis.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:13.159
Of course, every once in a while, as the Lord would lead, we'll take a diversion and go

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.279
to another portion of Scripture.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.159
And the last time that we were in the book of Genesis, we looked at Genesis chapter 15

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.000
and verse number 1.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.959
And as we looked at Genesis 15 and verse number 1, I titled the message, A Memorable Greeting.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.040
And as we looked at the verse of Scripture and we understand really the context of what

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.159
had taken place in Genesis chapter number 14, you read the first verse of Genesis 15

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:45.520
and you are encouraged greatly and you have to come to the conclusion that Abram was encouraged

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.099
greatly as to hear these words from the Lord.

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:55.279
The Bible says this in verse number 1 of Genesis 15, after these things, the word of the Lord

00:00:55.279 --> 00:01:04.260
came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield and thy exceeding

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.620
great reward.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.900
You'll remember that in chapter number 14, there was a coalition of forces that came

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.860
and they were victorious in their attempt to conquer.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.779
And of course, we find that Lot was one that was taken captive and Abram receives word

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.459
as to what has taken place.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.699
And Abram goes with those men from his own house, his armed trained servants, and he

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:33.339
takes them and they pursue after and God gives victory.

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:39.839
And after that victory and after they recover all things, we find that there were two encounters

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:41.180
that Abram has.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
The first was with the king of Salem, Melchizedek.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.419
And what a blessing for Abram to have the opportunity to speak with the king of Salem

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:57.220
and how that the meeting, the discussion between Abram and the king of Salem, Melchizedek,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.099
prepared Abram for the meeting that he would have with the king of Sodom.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.580
And how we mentioned it's so important for us to spend time with the Lord and to be in

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.500
his word and to commune with him and how that we daily spend time in walking with our God

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.740
and he prepares us for the events that we will face in our day.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.179
And we see exactly that in Genesis chapter number 14.

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:25.539
Remember it was Melchizedek that said that he was the priest of the most high God, El

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.539
Elyon.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.500
And it's the first mention of that name of God in all of the scriptures that he is the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020
most high God.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.740
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.539
And what a blessing to see how God would reveal that truth to Abram through that encounter

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.059
with Melchizedek.

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:50.139
And then when Sodom comes, the king of Sodom, excuse me, when he comes and he offers to

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:57.139
give some goods to Abram, Abram replies and says, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.940
the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.460
And we spoke about the significance of that because the reality is that had he not just

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.699
met with Melchizedek, the king of Salem, he would have had no knowledge of what he shared

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.940
in response to the offer of the king of Sodom.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.860
It was through that meeting that God revealed this truth about himself so that Abram would

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.059
be prepared, adequately prepared to be able to answer this king of Sodom.

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:34.139
Of course, there's the potential as you look at all that takes place, how that there was

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:40.020
the potential for that coalition to regroup and maybe attack again and so on and so forth.

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:45.740
I'm sure they weren't too excited about the fact that Abram came and recovered all and

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.179
maybe they'd go back and regroup and devise a new plan, a new strategy on how they would

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:53.179
go back.

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:59.619
And God appears to Abram and he says, first of all, fear not.

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.699
There's a lot of fear nots in the Bible.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.380
Fear thou not, fear not, be not afraid.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.300
I'm so thankful that God has given us into Abram in this greeting in verse number one,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.260
he begins by saying, fear not, Abram.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.700
You know, God is telling us to not fear.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.859
We don't need to be afraid.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.299
And we've, of course, finished up our study in the book of Hebrews and in our previous

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:32.859
couple of studies as we finished the 13th chapter, we were mindful of what we are told

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:38.220
in verse number six, where the Bible says that we might boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.260
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.380
Of course, the end of verse number five, that great promise when the scriptures remind us

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.140
that our God is ever present.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.019
He said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:55.519
He says to Abram, don't be afraid, fear not, Abram.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:59.980
And then he gives them two additional truths that are impactful.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.859
He says, number one, I am thy shield.

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:04.859
We think about a shield.

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:09.019
And of course, we think about the protection that a shield would offer to an individual.

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:13.700
When we think about God himself, now you notice in your Bible, it says after these things,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.019
the word of the Lord, it's all caps, it's Jehovah or Yahweh.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.820
His name that is, of course, revealed throughout the scriptures, the proper name of God.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.299
He's saying to Abram, I am thy shield.

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:35.140
I'm so thankful this evening to know that our God gives protection, that he is able

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.799
to protect, that he is our shield, our buckler.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:45.179
And we find that Abram would be reminded of this truth.

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:51.380
And then he says, and thy exceeding great reward.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.619
See Abram was offered some things from Sodom and he refused those things because he says,

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:02.820
I lift up mine eyes, or my hand, excuse me, unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.459
of heaven and earth, king of Sodom, I don't need what you're offering me.

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:10.179
And he's refused that which had been offered.

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:14.619
And then God comes and says, I am thy exceeding great reward.

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:15.920
I'm so thankful.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.500
We sing the song, now I belong to Jesus.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.179
Jesus belongs to me, right?

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:27.339
I mean, what a joy to know him as our personal Lord and savior, to understand that he is

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.500
our exceeding great reward.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.980
Listen, there are a lot of people around the world today that are seeking all sorts of

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.820
things to bring satisfaction.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.420
And there are people even within the broad category of Christendom that are looking to

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.940
find satisfaction through things, but we must understand that God is our exceeding great

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940
reward.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.380
And really, you know, he's all we need.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.579
And we find that he supplies all of our needs and what a blessing to know the Lord.

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:04.739
After we find this interaction that begins in verse number one, the very beginning of

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:08.500
verse number two says, and Abram said, and so in the next few verses, we're going to

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.899
have the opportunity, we will be privileged to read really a discussion that takes place

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:18.220
between the Lord God Almighty and Abram.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.579
And we find that Abram had introduced, had been introduced through this greeting with

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:29.820
these powerful truths, fear not, I am thy shield, I am thy exceeding great reward.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.980
And then Abram responds to the Lord and we'll be looking this evening at verses two through

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.459
six in particular.

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:42.019
Notice the Bible says this in verse number two, and Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:50.420
give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:08:00.260
And Abram said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed and lo, one born in my house is mine

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.260
heir.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.859
The title for the message this evening is from verse number three, where Abram says,

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:09.940
to me thou hast given no seed.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.380
To me thou hast given no seed.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.179
Here in Genesis 15 verses two through six, notice with me number one, if you're taking

00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:23.660
notes from verses two and three, I find that Abram's perspective is revealed.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.299
Abram's perspective is revealed.

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:29.100
You know, the reality is that each of us have a perspective on things that we encounter,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.940
things that we go through in life.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.200
And sometimes if we would be honest, our perspective is wrong.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.559
Sometimes our perspective needs to have some correction.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.119
And we'll see that that's the case with Abram here this evening.

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:47.640
But Abram reveals his perspective to the Lord, and through this conversation and through

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.979
the opportunity that we have by it being recorded in the Word of God, we have the privilege

00:08:53.979 --> 00:09:00.080
of looking at this discussion and really seeing the perspective of this man, Abram.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.260
I find this evening that as I look at verses two and three, that Abram is a man that is

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:07.900
very transparent with the Lord.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.299
Abram is a man that's coming and he's looking at what's taking place and we find that he's

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:18.340
sharing his heart, he's pouring out his heart and his concern to the Lord.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.700
And I think that's important for us to understand this evening.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.179
We see it throughout the Psalms when the psalmist is extremely transparent and shares his heart

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:27.179
with God.

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:30.580
You understand this evening that God knows your heart anyway.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.659
But you know it does something for us when we're just transparent with God and we just

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:38.859
share our heart with God.

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:43.859
Abram is looking at this situation, he's received some promises we'll look at in just a moment,

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:49.739
and he's noticing the current situation and what he does in seeing this perspective being

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.719
revealed is, number one, he states the problem.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:54.419
The problem is quite obvious.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:55.419
He has no son.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:56.979
He has no heir.

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:58.099
He has no son.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:00.099
He says this in verse number two.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.499
Lord God, what wilt Thou give me,

00:10:02.499 --> 00:10:03.579
notice this,

00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:08.179
seeing I go childless?"

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:10.259
Now, go back if you will a few chapters

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.339
in chapter 12,

00:10:12.339 --> 00:10:14.279
and you say, why is Abraham,

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.099
of course, that's not his name yet,

00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:17.439
it will be changed shortly,

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:20.019
but why is Abram asking this question?

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.799
Why is he stating this problem?

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.259
Why is it that he's saying,

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.259
what is it that Thou wilt give me

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.739
seeing I go childless?

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:28.179
Why is it that he says,

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.499
to me Thou hast given no seed?

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:33.139
Well, because in Genesis chapter 12,

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:33.979
in verse number one,

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:34.819
the Bible says,

00:10:34.819 --> 00:10:36.819
and the Lord had said unto Abram,

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:38.339
get thee out of thy country

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.419
and from thy kindred

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:40.779
and from thy father's house

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:43.219
unto a land that I will show thee,

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:45.259
and I will make of thee a great nation,

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:46.699
and I will bless thee,

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:48.219
and I will make thy name great,

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:50.379
and thou shalt be a blessing.

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:52.019
No doubt from verse number two

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:53.379
of Genesis chapter number 12

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.419
that Abram would understand

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:57.719
that there would be a son,

00:10:57.719 --> 00:10:59.879
a child that would be given

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:00.839
when God says,

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:02.159
I will bless thee,

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:04.999
I will make of thee a great nation.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:06.279
Verse number seven,

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.879
and the Lord appeared unto Abram

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:10.879
and said unto thy seed

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.599
will I give this land.

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:14.359
And there builded he an altar

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:16.579
unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:18.879
We find that God gives him this promise

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.839
in verse number seven of Genesis 12,

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:22.319
and he says this,

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:24.799
he says unto thy seed

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:26.199
will I give this land.

00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:27.479
Abram builds an altar,

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.079
he worships the Lord,

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.759
he responds in proper manner,

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:34.599
but yet we find that this promise

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:35.959
that is given in verse number seven

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:37.199
of chapter number 12,

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:38.879
when we come to chapter 15,

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:41.499
Abram's saying it's not happened yet.

00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:43.279
We find that in chapter number 13,

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:46.999
look there in verses 15 and 16,

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:49.279
it's repeated what we just read

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.639
in Genesis 12 and verse number seven.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:54.339
Here in Genesis 13 and verse number 15,

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.039
the Bible says for all the land

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:57.479
which thou seest,

00:11:57.479 --> 00:11:59.279
to thee will I give it,

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.559
notice the next phrase,

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.639
and to thy seed forever.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.999
Now you'll remember with me

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:08.359
as we study Genesis chapter number 13,

00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:11.199
that here is the division between Abram and Lot.

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:13.559
Remember there was some discord,

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:14.979
there was some contention,

00:12:14.979 --> 00:12:17.999
some strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle

00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:19.999
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:21.299
And Abram says listen,

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:22.539
this isn't good for us

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:24.239
and we need to separate.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:27.279
He tells Lot you go ahead and you pick

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.119
and Lot picks and he goes towards Sodom.

00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:31.959
We see and we understand that.

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.179
And the Bible tells us

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:34.679
that the men there were wicked

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:36.679
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:39.239
And Abram, he took that which was left,

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.599
he took that land

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.799
and he had given the option to Lot.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:46.519
We find here that God then speaks to Abram

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.919
beginning in verse number 14.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:50.119
And the Lord said unto Abram

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:51.839
after that Lot was separated from him

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.319
and you notice what he says,

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:55.359
that he was going to give him the land

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:57.239
and to thy seed forever.

00:12:57.239 --> 00:12:59.279
Notice what he says in verse number 16.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:03.159
And I will make thy seed

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:06.559
as the dust of the earth.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:09.119
So that if a man can number the dust of the earth,

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:13.279
then shall thy seed also be numbered.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:17.239
Do you see why Abram acknowledges a problem?

00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:19.319
He's been given this promise.

00:13:19.319 --> 00:13:21.399
In chapter number 12 in verses one and two

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.319
and verse number seven,

00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:25.479
again in chapter number 13 in verses 15 and 16,

00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:27.879
God has spoken to Abram

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:30.359
and God has told Abram

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:32.759
about making of thee a great nation

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:36.839
of you having this land and thy seed.

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:39.359
And yet Abram is saying,

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:41.239
I go childless.

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:43.519
I don't have a son.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:45.119
There's no seed.

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:46.599
And so we have a problem

00:13:46.599 --> 00:13:49.119
and we find that Abram

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:52.319
in offering not only the problem,

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:56.439
he really begins to offer a solution.

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:59.799
We notice in verses two and three again

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.839
of chapter 15,

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.119
notice what he says

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.559
and you see his perspective in verse number two,

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.759
he says, seeing I go childless

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.679
and then notice what he says

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.999
at the end of verse number two,

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:10.999
and the steward of my house

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:13.799
is this Eleazar of Damascus.

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:15.239
And Abram said,

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:19.719
behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:24.719
And lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.079
And so what is Abram saying?

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:28.799
He's saying, listen, God,

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:29.839
you've given me this promise.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:30.799
I don't have a seed.

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:31.839
I don't have a child.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.119
I go childless.

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:34.679
And so what about this one

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:37.039
that's been born in my house?

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.759
What about him being the heir?

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:44.759
What about that being the solution to the problem?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.559
And I look at that and I say,

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:48.279
really, if we'd be honest this evening,

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:49.599
if we were in Abram's shoes,

00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:52.039
we might come to the same conclusion.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:54.959
We might come to the same perspective

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.759
that Abram has.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:59.079
We understand as we go through the Scriptures,

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:01.079
Abram's not a young man

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:02.719
and he's getting more and more age

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:04.399
with each passing day.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.999
And he's saying, I don't have a child.

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:07.199
I haven't had a child,

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.279
but God's given me these promises.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:10.439
And as he's noticing,

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:12.719
he's analyzing the situation,

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:14.919
his perspective is being revealed to us

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:18.079
because he knows there's a problem.

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:19.719
He says here's a potential solution.

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.839
You know what the problem is with this solution?

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.759
It's the same problem that sometimes we have

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.999
with our solutions that we offer God.

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:29.599
They're by sight and not by faith.

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:31.839
It's a sight solution.

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.119
What do I mean by that?

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.279
Well, here's one that can fit the bill.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.879
I got this one that's been born in my house

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:42.199
and he can be my heir.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:46.319
And see, again, if we could understand this evening

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:48.999
and we could put ourselves into the shoes of Abram,

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:54.239
perhaps we too would come to the similar conclusion.

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:58.559
We say, Lord, how long do we have to wait for this?

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.879
Lord, I know You've promised this.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:03.919
You said that You were going to make of me a great nation.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:06.359
You said that this land was going to be

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:09.519
not only for me, but for my seed forever.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.759
But I go childless.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:15.719
And so Lord, one born in mine house,

00:16:15.719 --> 00:16:18.919
he says this in verse number three,

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:21.839
is mine heir.

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.639
And I believe that it's a sight answer

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.799
and not a faith answer.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.439
So we see number one, Abram's perspective revealed.

00:16:29.439 --> 00:16:32.799
Number two, if you're taking notes in verses four and five,

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.999
notice with me God's promise explained.

00:16:35.999 --> 00:16:39.519
I'm so thankful that our God is clear and precise.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.199
I'm so thankful that our God is patient.

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:44.839
Aren't you thankful that God's patient with you?

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:48.159
The Bible word is long-suffering.

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:50.319
And our God is long-suffering.

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:52.959
And our God, we could look at a whole host

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.799
of examples this evening,

00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:57.519
and we could look at how there are times in our lives

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.959
even that we could model some of that

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:02.919
which is contained within the pages of Scripture

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:05.159
where we kind of don't have the faith

00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:06.199
that we need to have

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:09.279
and we're not responding in the manner

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.239
in which we should,

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:14.279
and yet our God is long-suffering with us.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:16.279
And you notice in the text of Scripture

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.599
that God speaks a matter of factly.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.799
He speaks clear.

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:21.399
He explains some things to Abram

00:17:21.399 --> 00:17:22.759
in the next couple of verses,

00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:25.679
but you understand that He doesn't like reprimand him.

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:31.839
And our God is so gracious and so merciful.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:33.199
And here's what God does.

00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:34.999
Notice in verse number four,

00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:35.839
it says this,

00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:40.839
and behold, the word of the Lord came unto him saying,

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:46.519
this shall not be thine heir.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.919
Now, is that hard to understand this evening?

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:52.239
Sometimes we get these kind of things

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.839
from several different places

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:55.879
where people say, well, you know,

00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:57.679
the Bible's just hard to understand.

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:01.599
And the reality is that much of the Bible

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.599
is extremely easy to understand.

00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:04.999
And yes, there are some passages

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:06.959
that are much more difficult to understand.

00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:09.079
And that's why I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit of God,

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:11.399
who's the author of Scripture, lives within me.

00:18:11.399 --> 00:18:14.039
And He's the teacher, amen?

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:17.479
But the reality is that God comes to Abram,

00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:19.039
and He says, again,

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:21.239
when we look at the promise being explained,

00:18:21.239 --> 00:18:23.879
we find that the Lord came unto him,

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:27.719
and God is going to give a clear and precise response

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:29.079
to what Abram says.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:31.239
Remember, Abram's identified a problem.

00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:33.440
He's even offered a solution,

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:38.479
but God says, no, this shall not be thine heir.

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:41.319
Abram, you have the wrong perspective,

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:42.719
and we need to correct that.

00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:44.319
We need to change that.

00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:45.880
You need to understand something.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.679
This is what God is saying to Abram.

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.679
And I believe that as we look here at the Scriptures,

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:56.000
that God is going to give Abram some truth

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.719
that Abram would have to then respond to.

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:01.719
And I want you to hold onto that thought

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:04.319
as we kind of go through the message this evening,

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:07.839
because the reality is that God has given us truth

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:10.000
that we need to respond to.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.880
We've often said, and we've mentioned it

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.759
throughout the years,

00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:17.479
that faith is simply taking God at His word,

00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:19.559
that we believe God.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:23.479
And here, Abram comes and his perspective is revealed,

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:26.119
but now God's promise is being explained,

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:27.279
and he says this,

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:30.519
not only is he going to dismiss

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:33.759
the potential solution that Abram has offered,

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:38.759
but he's going to once again rehearse with specific details

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:41.079
the promise that he's making.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.359
Notice what he says.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:44.799
This shall not be thine heir, verse number four,

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:48.319
but he that shall come forth

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:53.319
out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:56.919
Again, isn't that hard to understand?

00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:59.839
No, it's quite clear, is it not?

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:00.679
Abram.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:03.839
Abram, I know that you go childless.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:05.459
See, you understand this evening

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:06.799
that God knows all things.

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.079
He's got perfect knowledge.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:09.799
He's omniscient.

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:12.519
When Abram comes to God in v. 2

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:14.039
saying, I go childless,

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.579
that wasn't a surprise to God.

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:18.339
He knew that already.

00:20:18.339 --> 00:20:20.919
But again, Abram is being transparent with the Lord.

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:23.879
He's concerned about this current situation.

00:20:23.879 --> 00:20:25.439
He's received the promise.

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:27.839
He doesn't know how God's going to do

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:30.359
all that God said He was going to do.

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.159
And so he's offering the solution

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:34.079
and God says, no, Abram,

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:37.319
that's not the way it's going to work.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.119
God says, he that shall come forth

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:43.439
out of thine own bowels

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:47.239
shall be thine heir.

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:51.439
I'm so thankful for the clarity of God's Word.

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:54.359
And that God spoke to Abram

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:56.599
in very clear language

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.719
as to what this promise would be.

00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:01.599
Notice in v. 5, God then takes

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:02.519
and it says this,

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:04.719
and He brought him forth abroad

00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:09.319
and said, look now toward heaven.

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:11.719
Now obviously, as we look at the context

00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:14.079
of the passage of Scripture that is before us,

00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:15.999
it was evening time.

00:21:15.999 --> 00:21:18.199
It was dark.

00:21:18.199 --> 00:21:19.799
And God says to Abram,

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:22.839
look toward heaven

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:26.399
and tell the stars.

00:21:26.439 --> 00:21:30.039
In other words, it means to count the stars.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.479
That's what that phraseology means.

00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:34.039
And tell the stars.

00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:35.839
Now I stepped out on the porch this evening

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:37.279
before the service to just look up

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:38.599
into the heavens.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.959
And it's a little bit of an overcast

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:40.919
kind of an evening.

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:42.959
It's supposed to rain later this evening.

00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:45.439
But last night, it was a pretty clear evening.

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:48.119
And Joseph and I were driving home

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.799
with Carter, my nephew,

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:53.959
and they noticed how bright the moon was.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:56.359
It was just about a full moon last night.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:57.359
And it was beautiful.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.719
It was clear.

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:01.599
And I can't help but think,

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:03.839
see, for us this evening,

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:04.999
if it were a clear evening

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:06.479
as it was last night,

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:08.399
you can see a number of stars

00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:11.079
in the heavens.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:13.079
But if you've ever been to a place

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:15.519
where there's not as many people

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:17.879
and there's not as much light,

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.239
you can see, and pollution by the way,

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.919
another thing that kind of messes with

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:25.199
the number of stars you can see.

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:27.000
You go out and you see the stars

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and it's like, man, I didn't know

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.079
there were this many stars.

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:32.719
Holly and I, almost 10 years ago,

00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:35.599
we went to Arizona for our anniversary.

00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:38.919
And I remember that evening,

00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:40.439
I think it was the first evening we were there,

00:22:40.439 --> 00:22:41.439
going on a walk.

00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:43.839
And I was a little bit apprehensive.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.599
Pierre, they told me there were rattlesnakes there.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:46.839
And so you're walking at night

00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:48.319
and I'm kind of, you know,

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:50.559
I'm looking down instead of up.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.039
But you just got to a point

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:54.559
where you began to look up into the heavens.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:57.639
And it's like, man, you don't see stars like this

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:00.239
around the big cities.

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.519
And God says, now think about when

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:07.839
this is being written several thousand years ago, right?

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:10.799
Abram is there and God says,

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:15.199
look toward heaven and tell the stars

00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:20.959
if thou be able to number them.

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:23.439
Have you ever tried to count the stars?

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:28.359
There are people that have attempted to do such tasks.

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:33.599
The reality is that they're numberless.

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:35.599
The reality this evening is that

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:39.199
we're mindful of what God said to us in Genesis,

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:41.719
and I love it, in Genesis 1-16,

00:23:41.719 --> 00:23:44.879
where the last five words of the verse of Scripture

00:23:44.879 --> 00:23:49.399
says He made the stars also.

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:50.959
And in making these stars,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.719
He made an innumerable host of stars

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:58.079
and He spread them through the heavens

00:23:58.079 --> 00:23:59.439
and through the galaxies.

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:01.079
And we find here this evening

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:04.239
that Abram is taken by God

00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:05.799
and He leads them out and He says,

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.399
Abram, I want you to look toward heaven.

00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:10.639
And He says, Abram, tell the stars

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:14.239
if thou be able to number them.

00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:16.479
And He said unto him,

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:19.479
God is speaking to Abram and He says unto him,

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:25.399
so shall thy seed be.

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:27.320
Wow.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320
I mean, when we really begin to look at

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.440
this promise being explained by God to Abram

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.079
and we understand this evening

00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:38.119
that our God is omnipotent,

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:39.959
that our God is able to do all things,

00:24:39.959 --> 00:24:42.000
and the reality tonight is that

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.559
because of having the whole canon of Scripture,

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.479
there's a whole lot that we know about God

00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:50.160
that Abram has not yet learned about God

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.440
in this particular text of Scripture.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.600
And we've learned names of God

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.679
that are revealed to Abram after this account.

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:02.160
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.079
God's not revealed Himself to Abram

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:06.079
at this point in that matter,

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:07.919
but we have the whole canon of Scripture

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:11.320
so we know that He shortly will do so.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.639
And we find that as we look at this book

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:16.399
and we look at the promises contained therein,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.239
that we stand in awe of who our God is

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:21.359
and we see how that God

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:23.919
who has made this promise to Abram,

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:26.000
that He explains it to him.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.639
He says, Abram, I understand that you're coming

00:25:28.639 --> 00:25:30.239
with your problem and I understand

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:31.880
that you've even brought a solution,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.919
but this one that's born in your house,

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:36.039
no, he's not going to be thine heir

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:38.320
because one that comes from your own bowels,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.320
he shall be thine heir.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.399
He then gives him this wonderful example

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:47.320
and this teaching of the stars and the heavens,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.720
and he says at the end of the verse,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:56.440
so shall thy seed be.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.639
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 1

00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:01.799
in verse 20,

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:05.239
with regard to the promises of God,

00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:10.399
it says, for all the promises of God in him are yea,

00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:13.959
and in him, amen,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.559
unto the glory of God by us.

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.679
We find that Peter would make this statement

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:24.320
that we have been given exceeding great

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.759
and precious promises.

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:28.799
And we have.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:31.160
One of the great hymns of the faith

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.239
that we sing,

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:35.199
standing on the promises.

00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:36.880
And we sing that song,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.399
and when we sing it,

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:40.759
I hope that our minds are thinking about

00:26:40.759 --> 00:26:43.720
and aware of the promises that God has given us

00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:46.519
and we find that God has explained

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.359
some of the promises in detail

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:51.880
such as He has to Abram in this passage of Scripture.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.079
And we find that He's given us these promises.

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:59.720
We're familiar with various portions of Scripture

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.359
and how that God in His grace and His mercy

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.880
would work with His people

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.079
and He would begin to give them

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:10.119
and reveal to them the truth of who He is.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:12.440
And He didn't always explain to them

00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:15.079
how He would do what He would do,

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:18.160
but He simply promised to do it.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.039
There are times in which the people of God

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.759
would hesitate and they would have

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:26.959
some level of doubt and unbelief

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:29.239
and God would come alongside them

00:27:29.239 --> 00:27:30.799
and begin to prove Himself.

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:32.880
And I think this evening of Gideon,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.000
and I love the account of Gideon in Judges 6-8

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.479
and how God would build the faith of Gideon

00:27:40.479 --> 00:27:43.399
by revealing to him and showing him,

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:47.320
yes, you are going to be used of Me

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.119
to bring victory to My people.

00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:51.720
It's a blessing.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.320
And we have this precious book that sits before us

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.839
and we have the opportunity to read it

00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:00.919
and to be encouraged by it.

00:28:00.919 --> 00:28:04.039
And when we look at the promises of God's Word

00:28:04.039 --> 00:28:07.279
and we consider this one tonight to Abram

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:10.079
and we find how God would explain the promise,

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:13.000
we ought to rejoice alongside Abram tonight.

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:16.039
I find myself thinking,

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:18.720
even as I'm turning here to the book of Numbers

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.839
and thinking about the scenario

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:25.479
in which Balaam was seeking to curse

00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:27.519
the nation of Israel.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:29.959
And of course, Balak's anger was kindled

00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:32.160
against Balaam and all of that.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.839
And you find that the Bible says this

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:38.559
in verse number 19 of chapter 23 of the book of Numbers,

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:41.119
God is not a man that he should lie,

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.200
neither the son of man that he should repent.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.320
Hath he said, and shall he not do it?

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.679
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.080
Can I tell you this evening,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.359
and I know that we know this,

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:58.320
but God has never failed on one promise

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.399
that He's ever given.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.440
He just never has.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.559
And you understand this evening that He never will.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.839
There's not one promise that God is not going to fulfill.

00:29:09.719 --> 00:29:12.279
We can be encouraged this evening

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.200
as we understand again,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.919
even as we read the Scriptures

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.080
and study the accounts of God's Word,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.559
where we have the privilege many times

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.719
of knowing the end of the story, so to speak.

00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:26.919
And we know in just a few chapters

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:28.760
that we're going to have the opportunity

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.640
to read about the birth of Isaac.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.359
We understand that God is going to fulfill the promise

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.960
that He had given to Abram on this particular day, evening,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.399
as God would recount these things to Abram.

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:45.520
We can read that and we understand that,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.559
but Abram was just living life like we are,

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:52.440
day by day, moment by moment.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.960
And so Abram had really, I would say it this way,

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.719
Abram had a decision to make.

00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:05.119
Chapter 15 begins with a greeting that's a memorable greeting.

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:09.359
We then read of this discussion, if you will,

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:13.119
and Abram bringing his concern before the Lord,

00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:16.319
the Lord responding to Abram,

00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:19.039
and now it's up to Abram to respond.

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:22.539
It's up to Abram to do something with that which he's just heard.

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:28.799
You know, the reality is that just as Abram is here in this text of Scripture,

00:30:28.879 --> 00:30:32.559
each of us every day when we go to the Word of God,

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:36.799
every day that we go to church and hear the preaching of the Word of God,

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.359
we have a decision to make.

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:41.119
What are we going to do with what we've received?

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:45.079
What will we do with the message that we heard at church?

00:30:45.079 --> 00:30:49.359
What will we do with the message that we heard in our youth ministry,

00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:53.559
in our Sunday school class, in our junior church class?

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:54.839
What do we do?

00:30:55.319 --> 00:31:00.479
Listen, we're seeking to bring somebody to a place of decision.

00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:01.879
What do we do with it?

00:31:01.879 --> 00:31:04.479
Tomorrow morning when you read your Bible,

00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:07.479
when you get up in the morning and you open up the Word of God

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:10.279
and you begin to read what thus saith the Lord,

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:15.679
you have a decision to make with regard to what you read.

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:18.799
And every day, we're faced with those decisions.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:24.999
And Abram is in a similar position that we find ourselves in on a regular basis.

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:29.839
And I want you to notice that Abram's perspective is revealed,

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:31.399
God's promise is explained,

00:31:31.399 --> 00:31:36.599
and if you're taking notes in verse number six, God's promise is embraced.

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:42.319
I'm so thankful for verse number six,

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:44.239
where the Bible says,

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:49.679
and he believed in the Lord.

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.759
He believed.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:55.159
Remember, we've said, I mentioned it just a few moments ago,

00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:57.599
that faith is taking God in His Word.

00:31:57.599 --> 00:32:00.479
Faith is believing God.

00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:04.359
Listen, I don't maybe understand all of how it's going to work,

00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:07.079
I don't understand how it's all going to come together,

00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:12.399
but I know that God has repeated and explained this promise

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:15.599
in very clear and precise terms,

00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:19.319
and therefore I have to respond in my response.

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:22.799
Abram's response is, I believe God.

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.999
I just believe.

00:32:23.999 --> 00:32:29.279
It says this, that he believed in the Lord.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.479
He believed in the Lord.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:34.639
I wonder this evening,

00:32:34.639 --> 00:32:38.159
how many times we can go to the Word of God,

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:44.159
and read of those that did not believe what God told them.

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:46.559
Oh, there are many examples.

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:51.719
Perhaps this evening we can go to positive examples of others that did believe.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.439
They just believed that God would work,

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:56.079
that God would show Himself mighty,

00:32:56.079 --> 00:33:02.319
that God would do what He only could do.

00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:07.279
I know that I often make the reference to the passage in Acts 27.

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.639
It's been so impactful in my own life,

00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:13.839
and I've been so challenged through the declaration of the Apostle Paul

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:16.839
when they're in the midst of the terrible storm on the sea,

00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:19.199
and all hope that they would be saved is gone,

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:21.079
and they've not seen the stars,

00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:23.439
and I mean, they just were wishing for the day,

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:26.519
and there's just no hope.

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:28.239
God sent an angel to speak,

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:34.319
and the Lord gave Paul truth with regard to their deliverance,

00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:39.999
and Paul simply declares to those other individuals that are on that boat,

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:43.159
I believe God,

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:46.159
that it shall be as it's been told to me.

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:50.119
And we just come to that place in our lives as Abram does,

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:52.639
where he embraces the promise,

00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:56.159
and I believe this evening that this first half of verse number 6

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:59.359
is a powerful statement of Scripture.

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:03.119
I believe that this first statement of Genesis 15 and verse number 6

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:05.599
not only is a powerful statement of Scripture,

00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:08.439
but it's a powerful testimony of Abram.

00:34:08.439 --> 00:34:10.359
That Abram believed God.

00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:13.599
He hears what God says.

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:17.759
Remember, it begins with this perspective of I go childless,

00:34:17.759 --> 00:34:21.199
I mean, I don't have any seed, I don't have a son.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.399
God, what are you going to do? How are you going to do this?

00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:29.079
This one that's been born in my house, and he says,

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.119
here's what I'm going to do.

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:33.199
Here's my promise.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.559
And Abram believes in the Lord.

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:38.719
He takes God in his word.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.599
And it says this,

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:48.079
and he counted it to him for righteousness.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:52.159
Wow, what a powerful truth of the Word of God.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:58.399
And as we look at this statement at the end of Genesis 15 and verse number 6,

00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:00.879
our minds will race to the New Testament

00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:05.959
in which this particular truth is referenced on at least two occasions.

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:09.079
And I want you to think about what God is saying here.

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:12.319
We see the faith of Abram where he believed in the Lord,

00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.719
but then we see the response of that,

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:17.639
the way in which God would respond.

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:21.879
And it says that he counted it to him for righteousness.

00:35:21.879 --> 00:35:24.919
Go over to the book of Romans if you will.

00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:34.599
In Romans chapter number 4,

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:44.399
look at the first three verses of Romans chapter number 4.

00:35:44.399 --> 00:35:47.759
The Bible says this in verse number 1 of Romans 4,

00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:51.319
What shall we say then that Abraham our father,

00:35:51.319 --> 00:35:54.919
as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.719
For if Abraham were justified by works,

00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:03.919
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:06.479
Now, it's interesting when you read verse number 2 there

00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:10.559
and you consider it with the truth that God gives us in Ephesians 2,

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:16.759
verses 8 and 9, in verse number 9 in particular,

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:19.879
where the Bible says, lest any man should boast.

00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:21.919
Because the Bible says in Ephesians 2, 8 and 9,

00:36:21.919 --> 00:36:23.359
For by grace are you saved through faith,

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:25.759
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

00:36:25.759 --> 00:36:29.039
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:29.959
What is he saying by that?

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.999
Well, if I could work my way to heaven,

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:34.599
I have whereof to glory, to boast.

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:36.919
And so in verse number 2 of Romans 4,

00:36:36.919 --> 00:36:39.439
here's what Paul is saying to these believers.

00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:44.159
He says, if Abraham were justified by works,

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:48.719
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:49.559
What is he meaning?

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:52.159
Well, he did enough good things to get to heaven.

00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:54.199
But you understand you can't do enough good things

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:55.439
to get to heaven.

00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:58.239
Because the Bible says that the gift of God

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:00.239
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:01.799
not by works of righteousness,

00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:04.919
which we have done in Titus 3 and verse number 5.

00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:07.039
We just looked at Ephesians 2, 8 and 9.

00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:09.159
The Bible is abundantly clear

00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:13.839
that salvation is by grace through faith alone.

00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:16.839
Paul says later in the book of Galatians,

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:19.519
I do not frustrate the grace of God.

00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:21.439
If righteousness came by the law,

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:24.479
then Christ is dead in vain.

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.279
Listen, His death was not vain.

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:31.319
His death was absolutely essential and required

00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:33.919
to pay for your sin and my sin and the sin of the world.

00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:34.739
Why?

00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:36.119
Because your works can't do it.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.999
And the law, keeping of the law can't do it.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:41.879
He says in verse number three,

00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:43.119
for what saith the Scripture,

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:46.479
by the way, it's always good to go to the Scripture.

00:37:46.479 --> 00:37:47.319
Amen.

00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:48.359
You understand some of the things

00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:50.159
that were going on in the first century.

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:52.559
Jesus dealt with it often with the Pharisees

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:53.919
and the Sadducees and the scribes

00:37:53.919 --> 00:37:55.199
and those religious leaders.

00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:56.679
What about the tradition?

00:37:56.679 --> 00:37:57.519
What do men say?

00:37:57.519 --> 00:37:58.359
What do you do?

00:37:58.359 --> 00:37:59.439
And how is this?

00:37:59.439 --> 00:38:01.039
No, what does the Scripture say?

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:05.199
You do err not knowing the Scripture.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.959
And we find that the appeal is given

00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:11.239
to these believers in the book of Romans.

00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:12.599
And Paul says this,

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:14.519
for what saith the Scripture?

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:15.359
Notice where it says,

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.559
Abraham believed God

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:23.559
and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.239
That's exactly the passage

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:26.799
that we've been looking at this evening

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:29.199
in Genesis 15 verses two through six,

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:32.599
in particular, zeroing in on verse number six.

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:35.439
Abraham believed in the Lord

00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:37.559
and he counted it unto him for righteousness.

00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:40.959
And we see here that Paul knew the Old Testament.

00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:42.559
He goes back to the Old Testament.

00:38:42.559 --> 00:38:44.039
He references the Old Testament.

00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:45.839
He says, now to him that worketh

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:49.000
is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.119
In other words, if you could work

00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:51.000
to get your way to heaven,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.199
you're earning something.

00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:55.479
But no, it's of grace.

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:57.879
Verse five, but to him that worketh not,

00:38:57.879 --> 00:39:01.319
but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly,

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:05.039
his faith is counted for righteousness.

00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:06.719
We could really look at the entirety

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:07.719
of Romans chapter number four.

00:39:07.719 --> 00:39:09.879
We don't have time this evening to do that.

00:39:09.879 --> 00:39:11.159
We could continue to go through

00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:15.599
and just see how Paul is using with great wisdom

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.119
the truth of the Old Testament

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:21.559
to prove these truths with regard to salvation

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.559
and righteousness being by faith, not by works.

00:39:27.279 --> 00:39:28.959
Go over to the book of Galatians, if you will,

00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:30.559
in chapter number three.

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:32.839
Notice another reference to this same portion

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:33.839
of Scripture that we're looking at

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:36.319
in Genesis 15 this evening.

00:39:36.319 --> 00:39:38.759
We'd find it in Galatians chapter number three.

00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:43.759
Look with me, if you will, in verse number six.

00:39:43.759 --> 00:39:46.479
Galatians three and verse number six.

00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:49.679
Even as Abraham, what's it say?

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:54.679
Believed God, and it was accounted

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:58.199
to him for righteousness.

00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:00.000
Oftentimes, we speak about the.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.960
righteousness of our God and I'm so thankful for he hath made him to be sin

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.439
for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."

00:40:09.439 --> 00:40:13.439
2nd Corinthians in chapter number 5 and we find here that the Bible's

00:40:13.439 --> 00:40:18.399
speaking about this event in Genesis 15 in verse number 6 as Abraham

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:22.979
believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Notice that as we

00:40:22.979 --> 00:40:25.920
continue to kind of pick our way through the third chapter of the book of

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.540
Galatians that the Bible says this in verse number 8 let's read verse 7 with

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:37.919
it, "...know you therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children

00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:44.479
of Abraham." So we get a look at the entirety of this promise that is made in

00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:50.040
Genesis chapter number 15 we find the fulfillment with the land and we've

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.799
talked about that in previous messages but now we think about the seed and

00:40:53.799 --> 00:40:58.599
we'll find that as we study the New Testament that yes there's the truth of

00:40:58.599 --> 00:41:02.799
Isaac being born the promised son and what a blessing and all that would be

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:08.559
entailed in that but the fullness of the the blessing and the fullness of the

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:15.160
promise is the fact that we are children of that we that have trust at Christ we

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.559
by faith are looked at as being the children of Abraham and it says in verse

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:27.480
number 8, "...and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:33.800
faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.680
be blessed." You understand that heathen there really is dealing with Gentiles so

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.440
then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham look down if you

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:53.120
will for sake of time to verse number 16 now to Abraham and his seed were the

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.480
promise made were the promises made notice what it says here in verse number

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:08.399
16 and he saith not and to seeds plural as of many but as of one and to thy seed

00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:16.679
notice these last three verses which is Christ see the messianic line we talk

00:42:16.679 --> 00:42:20.800
about that often and we look at the book of Genesis and we've just developed the

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.440
truth that God is giving us all the way in Genesis chapter number three about

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:30.320
the fact that Messiah would come and the truth of the the the messianic line and

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.080
how that the enemy Satan and you can study not only the book of Genesis but

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.360
throughout the Old Testament how that the enemy sought to destroy the line so

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.240
that Messiah would not be able to come but our God is greater and here we find

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.039
that as God is giving this instruction to Abraham and he's giving this promise

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:54.639
to Abraham he say in thy seed and we understand the New Testament that thy

00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:59.119
seed which is Christ now we understand that it would be thousands of years

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:04.199
later before that would come to its fullness in the promise but the

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:08.679
immediate fulfillment would be in the birth of Isaac and from there you go

00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:13.399
through the line and the of Messiah and eventually you can read of course in the

00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:16.960
New Testament you can read about the genealogies and all of those things and

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.160
what a tremendous blessing it is to understand that we find that the Bible

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.199
says that he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:35.600
I'm so thankful that God's promise was embraced by Abram we understand the

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.440
account of Abram in fact we'll finish up chapter 15 and then get into chapter 16

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.600
and we notice there's some really some sad events that are recorded for us in

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.720
Genesis chapter number 16 and we'll look through those things and we'll see all

00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:52.679
that's taking place but we rejoice this evening and what the Bible tells us

00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:59.639
about him Abram responding to what God had given him and explained to him so my

00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:03.759
question this evening as we look at the fullness of this and we really see not

00:44:03.759 --> 00:44:08.199
only the immediate but of course as we see where it says so shall thy seed be

00:44:08.199 --> 00:44:13.399
and how he told him in that if thou can tell the stars that they'll be able to

00:44:13.399 --> 00:44:17.760
number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and we see the of

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.720
course the many descendants of Abram Abraham but then we think about the

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:28.040
truth of the the New Testament there in the book of Galatians with believers

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.760
being of the seed of Abraham I mean that number just grows exponentially at that

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:39.279
point we begin to see how that God has fulfilled that which he has promised to

00:44:39.279 --> 00:44:45.239
do listen Christ came just as it had been prophesied this evening we see a

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:50.760
specific event in the life of Abram we see a specific promise we see a specific

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.480
situation I wonder tonight maybe there's been some promise that God has given you

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:03.359
in his word that maybe you've struggled with maybe there's been a measure of

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:08.679
doubt maybe there's been a measure of uncertainty maybe there's been some

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:14.239
unbelief if you will where you've read the promise you've you've seen what God

00:45:14.239 --> 00:45:18.359
says in his word but there's just some difficulty with you being able to see

00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:23.760
how it's going to come to fruition and you've struggled and you've dealt with

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.440
some difficulties and I would submit to you this evening if you're in that

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.679
position and you know that there's some promises that God has given in his word

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:38.880
and you're just struggling with it we're all human beings we understand that the

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:45.079
children of Israel when Moses sent those spies they came back and they didn't

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:51.720
believe God amen those ten spies they brought back an evil report and they

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.000
persuaded the entire congregation of the nation of Israel to doubt what God said

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.480
that God would do and we find that God would speak to a bro to Moses excuse me

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:10.839
and he would say how long will it be error my people believe me you

00:46:10.839 --> 00:46:15.920
understand this evening that God wants us to believe him and he says this in

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.760
that same conversation with Moses he says for all the signs which I have

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.440
showed among them one of this evening when we look at this book and we study

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.040
it we read it and we see all the promises and the fulfillments and the

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:35.399
way our God works and what he does oh man we ought to embrace the promises I

00:46:35.399 --> 00:46:41.000
mean more eagerly and readily even than those that we read of in the scriptures

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.640
why because we have so much more we have the whole of the scripture in this

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.519
evening I don't know the specific situation I don't know the specific

00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:57.519
promise but maybe there's a promise that that we know in our heart the Holy

00:46:57.519 --> 00:47:01.239
Spirit can can just kind of put his finger so to speak on that thing in our

00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:04.920
own life and so you know you're not you're not believing me in this

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.040
situation your faith is not what it needs to be your there's a measure of

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:15.559
doubt and will you just believe God will you just take God at his word will you

00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:22.480
just prove him and allow God to be exalted and allowed God to be magnified

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.079
see that's really the beauty of seeing God fulfill promises is that he gets the

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:34.880
glory it's not for us to take any level of credit for or recognition of those

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.600
things that happen but no we just see God working and we see God exalted in

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.760
God magnified and we just come to the place where we say I believe God I just

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:51.399
believe God I refuse to believe what the what the crowd wants to tell us I

00:47:51.399 --> 00:47:57.920
refuse to believe what the the media wants to tell whoever I just refuse why

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.079
because I just want to believe God I just want to believe God and when you

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:05.279
come to that place in your life where you just believe God sometimes people

00:48:05.279 --> 00:48:09.600
gonna look at you like you're crazy because why because you have faith in

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.399
what God has said and when you have that faith and what God has said and in

00:48:15.399 --> 00:48:20.559
God is pleased with your faith with your belief we find that God will work in

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:27.600
amazing ways this evening there's a very specific conversation that takes place

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.440
between Abram and God I'm thankful that Abram was transparent maybe somebody

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.599
just need to be transparent with God tonight God I know you said this but I'm

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:44.479
struggling because of I go childless right that's what Abram said there's I

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:49.119
don't have a son and whatever the promises in your life you say I just

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:53.400
don't know I don't see it and we're transparent with God and we pour our

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.880
heart out before the Lord and we let God minister to us and we let him take his

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.960
word and perhaps lead us to some other portions and passages of Scripture that

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:10.239
would just minister to us and help us to just grow our faith we'd leave saying

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:17.799
God I believe you I just believe you I don't have to know how see sometimes I'm

00:49:17.799 --> 00:49:23.200
guilty of wanting to know how I don't know if you are but a lot of times in my

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.919
life I'm guilty of wanting to know how how's it gonna happen how's it gonna

00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:28.400
come together Holly can tell you that in the kitchen she's mixing things together

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:33.239
putting a meal together and I'm like man I don't know if I'm gonna eat that

00:49:33.239 --> 00:49:40.880
but it comes together and it's great our God is amazing at bringing all these

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.640
things together and working them all together and saying I'm just gonna prove

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:51.799
myself I'm gonna show you my child what I'm able to do and all we need to do is

00:49:51.799 --> 00:49:55.520
just believe them just believe them let's pray father we love you this

00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:02.080
evening we thank you so much for loving us thank

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.280
We thank You for this account in Genesis 15

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.400
of this discussion between Abram and Yourself.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.700
We thank You that

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:19.920
You explained Your promise in detail.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.880
We thank You for Your clarity.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.120
Lord, how we rejoice in the response of Abram.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.480
Lord, I just pray tonight

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.920
that You'd help us.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.920
I understand the account that is before us

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:44.000
is a specific situation for Abram.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.160
But God, Your Word is full of promises for us

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.200
as Your children.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.720
And if we'd be honest tonight,

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.160
there are times in which we stagger at Your promises,

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.080
that we struggle,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:03.520
that we have doubt,

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.560
that we fail to exercise faith in what You've said,

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.440
perhaps even explaining or justifying.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.280
But God, I pray tonight

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.360
that as only You can,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.920
You would minister to each of us.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.640
Challenge us.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.760
Comfort us.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:28.840
Help us, God, to simply believe You,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.840
trust You,

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.840
and obey You.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.360
I pray that in these next few moments

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.440
that the Holy Spirit of God would have His will in way,

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.640
that decisions would be made that would please Thee,

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.760
that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.760
and impact eternity.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.960
We'll be careful to give You the glory for all that You'll do.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.440
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
