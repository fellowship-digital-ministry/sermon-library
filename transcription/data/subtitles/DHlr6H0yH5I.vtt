WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
And I had the opportunity to speak with someone today

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.039
about the Lord.

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:06.559
And it was very obvious through conversation

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.159
that they did not know the truth of salvation.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.680
They were convinced that it was necessary

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.079
to be a good person and to go to confession

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.120
and so on and so forth.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.079
And I was able to share with them

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.959
about the fact that just recently

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:24.760
we've been preaching through the book of Hebrews

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.319
and dealing with the fact that we have a great high priest

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.639
and that he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:34.400
And what a joy to be able to share the word of God.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.279
I wish I could tell you that they trust that Christ

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:38.479
is their savior, but I can only tell you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.240
that a seed was planted, amen.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.880
And for that we rejoice, but God gives us opportunity.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.599
I often think about the way in which God has blessed

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:50.139
and so thankful for the privilege of knowing him

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.439
that someone that went before us was faithful, amen.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.000
Acts chapter number four records

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.599
a very interesting passage of scripture,

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.279
a passage that many times we're familiar with,

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.840
but this evening I wanna focus on something specific.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.919
And let me say this, even as we begin looking

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:09.239
at this passage that is before us as believers,

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.760
we understand that we should spend time in communion

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.720
with our Lord regularly.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.440
In fact, we often speak about the importance

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.919
of Bible reading and prayer time

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.680
and the importance of our daily walk with the Lord.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.239
It is imperative, I believe this evening,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:29.839
I believe that it is imperative for us as God's people

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.639
to have a consistent walk with him.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:36.680
And as we look at Acts chapter number four,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.720
we find that Peter and John are being questioned

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.160
by the religious leaders.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.599
And what they're being questioned about is the miracle

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.519
that is recorded in Acts chapter number three.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.480
No doubting, notable miracle had taken place

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.720
in Acts chapter number three.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.959
It was the gate beautiful where the lame man laid

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.720
and he was asking alms.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.800
And of course, Peter and John,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.959
as they're going into the temple to pray,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.360
Peter speaks to him and the man is gloriously healed.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.559
And what a wonderful event that we find recorded there

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.839
in Acts chapter number three and the opportunities

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.360
that that event, that miracle presented

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.080
on being able to preach the gospel.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.440
Peter speaks up and delivers a powerful response

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440
here in Acts chapter number four.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.399
And no doubt it's worth studying.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.039
It's an important aspect of how Peter responds.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.119
This evening, however, I want to consider

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.199
what these religious leaders said of Peter and John.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.520
I want you to notice in verse number 13,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.800
and we'll kind of catch some context here,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.960
but let me just read verse 13,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.479
give you the title this evening.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.839
The Bible says this, now when they,

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.520
and if you look back, we'll mention who they are,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.679
it's the religious leaders.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.240
When they saw the boldness of Peter and John

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.919
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men,

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.199
what they were recognizing is that

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.440
they had not been formally trained in the same schools

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.279
that they had been trained in,

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.080
and therefore, they were not looking at them

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.080
as being scholars or ordained teachers, if you will.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.279
And so the Bible says here that they marveled.

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.000
And they took knowledge of them

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.639
that they had been with Jesus.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.320
This evening, I want to use that last phrase

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.559
of Acts 4 and verse number 13 as our title,

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.080
that they had been with Jesus.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.559
If you go back to verse number one,

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.600
the Bible says this, and as they spake unto the people,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.199
the priests and the captain of the temple

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.440
and the Sadducees came upon them,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.479
being grieved that they taught the people

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.679
and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.479
And so we find that they're busy doing the work

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.919
that God had commissioned them to do.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.199
They were faithfully obeying what God had told them.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.160
And the Bible says this in verse number three,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.080
and they laid hands on them and put them in hold

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.119
until the next day, for it was now eventide,

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.960
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.800
Aren't you thankful for that testimony?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.639
Amen.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.160
And it says this, and the number of the men

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.399
was about 5,000.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.559
It's amazing.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.399
We often speak about Pentecost and the 3,000

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.880
that were added into the church.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.440
And here in Acts 4, we see that the number is 5,000.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.359
As you continue to go through the book of Acts,

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:30.799
you'll find that instead of providing numbers,

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:32.959
they'll provide a multitude.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.839
And multitudes, plural, is used to reference

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.200
those that come to Christ.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.559
But it says in verse number five,

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.320
and it came to pass on the morrow,

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.160
that their rulers and elders and scribes

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.279
and Annas the high priest and Caiaphas

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.000
and John and Alexander and as many as were

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.880
of the kindred of the high priest

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.920
were gathered together at Jerusalem.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.000
And when they had set them in the midst,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.959
that's Peter and John, they set them in the midst.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.480
And so can you, in your mind's eye,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.640
I mean, imagine where we are.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.720
Imagine what's going on.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.359
All of these religious leaders,

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:10.559
I mean, an intimidating crowd of people

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.640
that are there, and they bring Peter and John

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.079
into the midst of them, and they ask,

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.440
they say, by what power or by what name

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.320
have you done this?

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.920
And this question is posed in verse number seven,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.399
and then we begin to read in verses eight through 12

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.679
the powerful response of Peter.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:32.559
I mean, it's only a few verses of Scripture,

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.640
but the Bible tells us, and I believe it's imperative

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.600
that we understand in verse number eight

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.000
that it says, then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.920
Amen?

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.079
He is filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:47.959
We speak about, we understand Ephesians 5, 18.

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.160
The Bible speaks about not being drunk with wine

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.200
or in his excess, but being filled with the Spirit of God.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.920
And we understand that Jesus had told them

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.359
before his ascension in Acts chapter number one,

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.679
but you shall receive power after that

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.519
the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:06.320
We often make note of the biblical teaching

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.359
with regard to the Holy Spirit,

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.679
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:16.200
the earnest of our salvation, the proof of our redemption,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.200
that the Holy Spirit of God indwells every believer

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.799
at the moment of salvation, but we understand

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:24.720
the importance of being filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.040
being emptied of self.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.779
It's the idea of having, where the Holy Spirit of God

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.720
has control of us, and we find that Peter stands,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.399
and he says, ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel,

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.200
and he begins to give a response.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.279
I want you to note, as we look here,

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.359
I'm just giving a little introduction into what's going on,

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:48.320
and we're gonna focus the remainder of our time

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.239
on the response of these religious leaders

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:55.040
in taking consideration of what they said.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.720
But Peter says, if we this day be examined

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.739
of the good deed done to the impotent man,

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.559
by what means he is made whole,

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.799
that's the miracle in chapter number three,

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.640
be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.519
notice that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:13.920
whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.440
even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.220
This is the stone which was set at naught of you builders,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.720
which has become the head of the corner.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.600
Neither is there salvation in any other,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.839
for there's none other name under heaven given among men,

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.399
whereby we must be saved.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.640
That's a powerful response.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.359
I mean, we could dig in and examine that this evening,

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:38.399
and we have in the past.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:41.320
But this evening, I wanna focus upon the response

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.880
of these religious leaders.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.600
And the Bible says that when they saw the boldness

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.700
of Peter and John, and they had this understanding,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.279
they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men,

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.720
they marveled.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.160
They marveled.

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:02.320
Last week, we spoke about the fact that Jesus marveled.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.399
What did he marvel?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.359
He marveled because of their unbelief.

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:06.799
Remember, we looked at that

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:10.040
in Mark chapter number six, verses five and six.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.480
This evening, we see that these religious leaders,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.160
they're marveling at what they're seeing.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.119
They're marveling at the boldness of Peter and John.

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.519
Again, I believe that oftentimes,

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.500
this group of religious leaders,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.200
they had this intimidation factor

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.600
upon those in whom they would question.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.239
Allow your mind just for a moment

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:32.580
to go back to the miracle of John chapter number nine,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.000
when Jesus healed the man that was born blind.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.960
And you'll remember that they begin to inquire,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.919
and they begin to examine this man,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.239
how it was that he was healed.

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.280
And there were some that said, yes, this is him.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.619
And others said, no, it's not him, but he's like him.

00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:50.479
And all of this thing going on.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.320
And so what do they do?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.679
They bring the parents in,

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:56.760
and the parents say, he's of age, ask him.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.599
Why?

00:08:57.599 --> 00:08:59.200
Because there was some intimidation

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.320
that this group of people held

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.299
over the Jews and they're in the midst.

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:09.140
And yet, Peter and John, and Peter specifically,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.679
as he is the spokesman here,

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.880
he's the one that stands up.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.119
And as he is filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:18.520
he delivers this message.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.799
And this message that he delivers

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:25.200
has a profound impact upon these religious leaders,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.200
and they took knowledge that they had been with Jesus.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.719
Now, understand this evening, if you're taking notes,

00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:37.239
number one, the privilege of fellowship.

00:09:37.239 --> 00:09:39.179
The privilege of fellowship.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.159
On Sunday morning, as we were studying

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:43.559
through the book of Hebrews, in Hebrews chapter number 10,

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:46.000
I dealt with the subject matter of a new and living way.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.979
And we had discussed how that access

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:51.179
was now made available to us as the people of God,

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:52.940
and what a joy it is.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.780
But the result of understanding that we've received access

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.500
is that we're to draw near.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.140
And we find here.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.540
this evening that as we notice the response of these religious leaders, that we must first

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.900
recognize the privilege of fellowship.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:16.860
What a joy that the God of the universe would be interested in having fellowship with any

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.380
of us, but He desires it.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.680
The fact of the matter is that we can have as much fellowship with Him as we truly desire.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.780
Think about that for a moment.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.560
The fact that we could enter into His presence.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:40.080
Now I understand this evening that Peter and John had the unique opportunity to walk with

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.280
the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, and during that period of time, no doubt as

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.640
Peter and John, as you trace the gospel records and begin to see how that these guys really

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.960
are part of that, not only the disciples, but you see really kind of that inner circle.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.620
You kind of have the opportunity, you know, Peter and John, they have the opportunity

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.060
at the Mount of Transfiguration, right?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.780
You begin to see these things, but we understand this evening that they had the privilege and

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.860
the opportunity to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, but in

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.020
Acts chapter number one, He ascended to heaven, and their walk with Jesus didn't end when

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.100
He ascended to heaven.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.660
They had to continue to have fellowship with Him, though now their fellowship would be

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.460
different than it had been, right?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.960
No longer physically are they able to see Him in His presence and walk with Him and

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.560
do those things and see the miracles and what have you, but they would have the opportunity

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.200
to enjoy times of prayer.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.960
In fact, we see often as you look at Peter and John and you consider their ministries

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.080
and their lives and their teachings, how that they understood the great privilege of fellowship.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.740
In fact, if you hold your place there in Acts and turn to the book of 1 John, I want you

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.340
to notice what John says here in these first several verses of the first chapter of the

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.660
book of 1 John.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.820
We find that he's writing here and obviously writing to believers, and he says this in

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.060
verse number one,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.460
"...that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.060
eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, are the word of life.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.440
For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness and show unto you

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.680
that eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested unto us."

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.920
Notice what he says in verse three,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:40.520
"...that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.240
with us, and truly our fellowship is with whom?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.920
With the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ."

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.060
See, Peter and John, and John obviously writing here in this first epistle, we find that he

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.540
is an eyewitness of these things, right?

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.860
He's giving this eyewitness account.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.100
He's saying, "...that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you," that's what an

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.540
eyewitness does.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.140
He gives this testimony, and we find that he says, "...that ye also may have fellowship

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:17.420
with us," but notice, "...truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.420
Christ."

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.720
At this point, Jesus had already ascended, amen?

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.680
He'd been ascended, He'd been seated at the right hand of the throne of God for a number

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.500
of years by the time of the writing of 1 John.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.240
Notice verse four, "...and these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.280
This then is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare unto you, that God is

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.520
light and Him is no darkness at all.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.920
If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920
truth.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.680
But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.320
and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin."

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.960
And so we understand here, even as we look at the epistle of 1 John and understanding

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.800
this privilege that he understood of fellowship with the Lord, Peter gives instruction to

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.820
those that he writes to in 1 and 2 Peter of the importance of growing in grace and knowledge

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.280
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.480
How does that happen?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.640
It's through that privilege of fellowship, of communion, of feasting as we now have the

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.160
complete canon of Scripture, feasting upon the Word of God.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.440
These recipients in 1 and 2 Peter, they were receiving these letters that would encourage

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.680
them and instruct them and help them to understand.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.160
Remember, he says, "...as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, that

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.840
ye may grow thereby."

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.840
In the first epistle in chapter 2 and verse number 2, and then he ends in 2 Peter 3, 18,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.680
about the importance of growing in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.480
And so we find as we look at this truth and what these religious leaders in Acts chapter

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.720
number 4 said of Peter and John, they took knowledge of them that they had been with

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720
Jesus.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.240
I hope this evening that we recognize the privilege of fellowship.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.400
I hope this evening that you've experienced today fellowship with your Savior.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:24.000
The reality is this, and I think this is so important.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.760
Their fellowship did not prevent hardship.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.880
Amen?

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:41.240
The fellowship that Peter and John had with the Lord Jesus Christ did not prevent hardship.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:50.640
However, the fellowship that Peter and John had with the Lord prepared them for hardship.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.420
I want you to think about that just for a moment this evening.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.920
The reality is that we understand as we read throughout the Gospel accounts, as we read

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.640
throughout the New Testament, we read about the persecution of the early church and all

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.520
that they endured and all that they faced and all the adversities that they dealt with

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.080
and the hardships that they faced.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.760
If we would look at it from that perspective, we understand that they had been prepared

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.280
to face those things because of the fellowship that they had with their Lord.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:31.080
And this evening, no doubt, each of us have experienced hardships in our life.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.320
Amen?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.680
We've experienced troubles and difficulties and hardships, and the reality is that your

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:46.360
communion with the Lord may not prevent you from having those hardships, but your communion

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:53.440
with your Lord will prepare you for dealing with those hardships.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.520
We don't prepare in the moment that the hardship appears.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.640
Amen?

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.640
We prepare all along the way.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.680
We're daily, consistently walking with God.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.200
And as we daily, consistently walk with our Savior, and as we're communing with Him and

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.520
we're enjoying that fellowship with Him, then that hardship comes and we are not, again,

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.400
it's not been prevented, but we're prepared for how to deal with it.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.840
Often as I look at the Scriptures, often as I read of those great heroes, quote-unquote,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.160
of the faith that we would look to, that we would look at as being martyrs of the faith,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.600
and you read the various peoples that have gone before us, and I was thinking today specifically

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:51.480
of Harlan Popov and some of the things that this man in Bulgaria faced and the hardships.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.540
This is a man that walked with God.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:02.440
He faced intense persecution, but because of his consistent walk with God, he was prepared

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440
to deal with that.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.480
And there are times in our lives we can say, how could they respond that way?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.560
How could they deal with the hardship and the manner in which they did?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.400
Because they daily walked with God.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.640
They daily walked with God.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.840
I want you to think about what is said in another chapter here, in Acts chapter 5, at

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.360
the end of the passage, and I won't have time to develop the entire thought of what's going

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.559
on here, but you understand that once again the disciples are facing difficulty and hardship,

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:38.000
and they're telling Him that they need to stop preaching the name of Jesus, and they've

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.960
said that we ought to obey God rather than men, and what a great testimony that they

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960
had.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.119
And there's one that stands up, Gamaliel, that begins to give them some information

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:53.160
with regard to, and I love what he says, he says this with regard to the work and

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.000
the opposition, what's going on at the end of verse 38, he says, if this counsel or this

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.320
work be of men, it will come to naught.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:08.359
But, verse 39, if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest happily ye be found even

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:11.440
to fight against God.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.480
Amen.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.320
Now I want you to consider that even after these religious leaders agreed with what he

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:25.080
said, they still, according to verse number 40, and to him they agreed, and when they

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.200
had called the apostles, what's the next three words in your Bible?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.480
And beaten them.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.280
They commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.720
And they departed from the presence of the counsel, what does it say?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:51.119
Rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:55.960
See, it wasn't that after they had gotten beaten they decided to have some time with

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960
God.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.440
They'd been daily walking with God.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.980
Consistently having that fellowship,

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.480
that communion with their Lord and their Savior.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.440
See, we recognize this evening the privilege of fellowship.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.700
You understand this evening that,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.160
unless you're a child,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.280
probably no one forced you to spend time with God today.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.540
And I say unless you're a child,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.240
because sometimes as children,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.080
parents are able to say,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.540
hey, did you do your devotions today?

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.200
Did you have time with the Lord today?

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.560
But for most of us,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.560
no one forces us to spend time with God.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.480
I do think it would be an important thing

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.960
that we would hold ourselves accountable,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.600
that we'd have an accountability.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.920
Maybe our spouse or someone else.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.520
Hey, how's your time with the Lord today?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.160
Amen?

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.560
Because it's important that we have

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.000
that daily consistent walk,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.540
and we recognize it's a privilege.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.920
It's an absolute privilege

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.680
that the God of the universe would allow us

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.480
to commune with Him.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.240
And He never says, okay, your time is up.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.800
I'll give you a few minutes.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.760
See, there's some people in this earth,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.520
on this earth, that have positions

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.760
that they hold themselves in high regard.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.319
And they have limited time.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.240
And if you have an audience with them,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.400
it is a minimal amount of time.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.080
But the God of the universe says, come.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.000
Let's have fellowship together.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.440
What a joy.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.080
Daily faithfulness leads to godly usefulness.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.200
A preacher of yesteryear said that.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.200
Daily faithfulness leads to godly usefulness.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.800
What a joy.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.319
This evening, I've been reminded of this truth

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:44.600
as I've considered what's happening here

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.880
with the disciples in Acts 4,

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.080
that their fellowship did not prevent the hardship,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.959
but it prepared them for the hardship.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:57.240
See, I wanna be prepared for the hardship.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.200
I'll be honest with you this evening.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.760
I'd rather not have the hardship.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.600
Amen?

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.880
Can we be transparent one with another this evening?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.559
I'd rather not have the hardship.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:10.119
And I'm sure that you probably feel the same way.

00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:11.040
Amen?

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.400
I'd rather not.

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:15.199
But I'll tell you this.

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:16.720
I wanna be prepared for it.

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:19.199
Amen?

00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:20.919
How am I gonna be prepared for it?

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:22.440
I gotta spend time with God.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.720
And that time that I spend with God is precious.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.880
And it's a privilege.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.160
This evening, not only do we know

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.479
the privilege of fellowship,

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:33.720
but I want you to consider with me

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.800
the product of fellowship.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.279
I'm sure that this is not an exhaustive list

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:40.639
you could probably add to.

00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:43.639
It would be advantageous of you

00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:46.040
to add to the list of a few things

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.600
that I want you to jot down this evening

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.320
that are the product of fellowship.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.520
Number one is joy.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.720
Joy.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.360
Remember what he said in 1 John 1,

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.080
as we read that just a moment ago in verse number four,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.919
he says,

00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:02.720
and these things write we unto you

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.479
that your joy

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:05.440
may

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.559
be

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.240
full.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.839
In Psalm 16 and 11,

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:12.600
the Bible says that in thy presence

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.360
is fullness of joy.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.919
Can I tell you that as we spend time with God,

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.119
when we commune with Him,

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:21.279
when we walk with Him,

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.040
when we spend time with Him in prayer,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.040
when we feast upon the Scriptures,

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.160
that He gives us joy.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.919
We have joy.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.080
I remember singing,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.720
there's actually a few kids' songs

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.639
that deal with joy,

00:23:35.639 --> 00:23:38.559
but there's one children's song that deals with joy,

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.479
and in that song it says,

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:42.720
Jesus gave it to me,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.240
and nothing can destroy it.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.279
And I like that.

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:49.960
Because the reality is that we can rejoice

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.800
even though we find ourselves in manifold temptations.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.520
Peter talks about that in 1 Peter 1.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.400
The trying of your faith,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.559
all that they were dealing with,

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.839
yet you're rejoicing.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:02.680
Why?

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.080
Because you've spent time with God.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.639
Because you've been in His presence.

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:08.839
Because you've understood the privilege

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:11.040
and the product is that you have joy

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.199
that you can rejoice,

00:24:12.199 --> 00:24:15.640
even in the midst of the hardship.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.399
What do they say in Acts 5?

00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:18.959
After they were beaten

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:20.279
and after they were threatened,

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:22.399
they went out rejoicing

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.959
that they were counted worthy

00:24:25.959 --> 00:24:28.000
to suffer shame for His namesake.

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:31.040
I don't know this evening

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.679
how much I would rejoice after being beaten.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.720
I'm just being transparent with you.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.119
But I'd like to think

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:43.440
that as I look at the truth of Acts 5

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.239
in verse number 41,

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:47.839
and I compare the truth of that passage

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:50.640
with what Peter says in 1 Peter 4,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.239
and I'm not going to read all of it.

00:24:52.239 --> 00:24:53.360
Just jot it down in your notes.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.559
1 Peter 4 verses 14 and 16.

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.600
Here's what he says.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.200
If you be reproached for the name of Christ,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.000
happy are ye

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.720
if we suffer for Him.

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:09.720
You can go back later and read all of that.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.200
1 Peter 4, 14 through 16.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.880
In fact, many references in the book of 1 Peter

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.799
about the rejoicing that we have.

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:20.760
But you find that one of the products of fellowship

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.360
is that we have joy.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.480
We have joy.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.799
Because in His presence is fullness of joy.

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.160
Number two,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.880
as we enjoy fellowship with the Lord,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.040
as we spend time in communion with Him,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.360
I believe that He gives us hope.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.239
He gives us hope.

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:42.360
That hope that's a certain expectation.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.799
You understand that Paul says this

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.760
at the end of Romans, in Romans 15.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.279
In fact, in just this single verse of Scripture,

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:54.080
he'll cover the first, second, and third

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.080
product that I have listed here, or products.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.480
But in Romans 15, in verse 13,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.320
it says this,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.480
now the God of hope,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.640
aren't you thankful He is the God of hope?

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.959
That expectation that we have.

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:13.200
Knowing that what He has said He will do.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.200
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:22.839
and peace in believing that you may abound in hope

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:25.920
through the power of the Holy Ghost.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.799
That's a powerful verse of Scripture.

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:33.959
The product of fellowship,

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:35.679
number one, joy, number two, hope,

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:37.720
number three, peace.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.799
Peace.

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:41.839
We see it here again in Romans 15, in verse number 13,

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:45.239
that the God of hope will fill you with all joy and peace.

00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:49.119
And so we see joy, hope, and peace.

00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:51.600
You think about the fact that the Bible says

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.519
that He will give us perfect peace.

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.959
That He will give us a peace

00:26:55.959 --> 00:26:58.320
that passeth all understanding.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.279
You consider Isaiah 26, in verse number three,

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:06.399
and what we find there in that Old Testament prophecy

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:10.839
and the truth with regard of keeping our mind upon Him.

00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:13.920
This is now what keep Him in perfect peace.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.959
Whose mind has stayed on Thee because He trusteth in Thee.

00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:20.279
Trusting the Lord forever,

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:24.679
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:27.040
Paul says that not only will He give us a peace

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.720
that passeth all understanding,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.839
he says that we're to let the peace of God

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:33.720
rule in our hearts.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.760
I love that truth.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.160
As you think about the imagery

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.559
of the peace of God ruling in your hearts

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:43.559
and really as Paul would give that admonition

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:47.160
and that instruction with regard to the peace of God

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.600
and about it ruling in our hearts,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.000
we find that what he's dealing with

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
is the subject matter of the idea

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.600
of one who would umpire or rule

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.640
some type of a sporting event.

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:03.279
I said to a group of young people

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:06.200
that were actually the boys basketball team

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.600
that Joseph played on

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.720
and they would have devotions once a week

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.440
and they asked me to share some truth with them

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.119
and I took them to this truth

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:16.959
with regard to the peace of God

00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.799
and what a joy to understand.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:21.760
And as Paul is writing to the believers in Colossae,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.600
he says in the peace of God rule in your hearts

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.320
in chapter three and verse number 15.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.440
And the idea, I said to these young boys,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.760
I said, listen, the fella on the court

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.119
that has the black and white stripes and the whistle,

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:34.799
he's ruling the court.

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:40.640
It doesn't really matter what you think, right?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.039
It wasn't a foul.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:43.280
If he called a foul, like, I mean,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.799
you can argue until you get thrown out of the game, right?

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:48.640
Why?

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.200
Because ultimately he's the one that's ruling, right?

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.440
We understand that.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.239
I've seen people, I've watched sports for a lot of years.

00:28:57.239 --> 00:28:59.760
I've seen people get thrown out of games

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.520
almost always when a manager, skipper for a baseball team

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.520
wants to come out and argue strikes and balls,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.799
he ends up getting kicked out.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.320
He can kick dirt on the plate.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.559
He can criticize the umpire as much as he wants.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.679
I've never seen an umpire say, you know what?

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:19.520
You're right.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.359
Have the batter come back.

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:22.599
We'll go ahead and change the count.

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:23.440
Doesn't happen.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.640
See, the Bible says that the peace of God

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.400
is to rule in our hearts.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.080
Where does that peace of God come from?

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.159
It comes from him.

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:37.559
It comes from that time of fellowship with him.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.640
It's one of those products of fellowship

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.280
that not only do we have joy being in his presence,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.239
we have that hope, we have that peace.

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:46.119
I find even in the text of Scripture

00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:48.119
in which we're studying this evening here in Acts 4,

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.760
as we're looking at this passage,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.000
I find that one of the products of fellowship is boldness.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.640
Boldness.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.799
It says this in verse number 13,

00:29:57.799 --> 00:29:59.400
when they saw

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.040
the boldness of Peter and John.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.920
Peter wasn't intimidated by these fellas.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.400
Sometimes we get intimidated by people.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.400
We get intimidated by the degrees that they have or the whatever, you kind of get intimidated,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400
but Peter's not intimidated.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400
Why?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400
He's filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:26.000
He's spent time with Jesus, and he's able to stand up and give an answer, and they perceive,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.660
they notice, they saw the boldness, and they say they've been with Jesus.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.720
At the end of chapter number four, not actually all the way at the end, but later on here

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.400
in Acts chapter number four, they're praying after this situation, after they're once again

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.000
told that they can't speak in His name, so on and so forth, and they pray.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.160
And you know what they pray for?

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.960
They pray for boldness.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.560
We've used it as a theme in our church with Missions Conference, boldness to speak thy

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560
word.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.760
We've used it in theology in verse number 29, and it's interesting because the Bible

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.400
says this, it tells us in verse number 24 that when they heard that, they lifted up

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.120
their voice to God, so we know they're praying.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.480
That's part of fellowship, amen?

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.160
And they're praying, and in verse number 29, they pray, and they pray specifically that

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.400
God would give boldness, and then it says in verse number 31, and when they had prayed,

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.960
the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.560
Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God, how?

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.120
With boldness.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.120
With boldness.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:34.080
The result, a product of fellowship.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.160
I believe that you could add to the list, again, it's not an exhaustive list, there's

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.160
a number of other things that we could add to the list this evening, but just a quick

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.760
sampling of understanding this evening the privilege that is ours to spend time with

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560
the Lord.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:03.040
I have written in the margin of my Bible, how much time have we spent with our Master?

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.720
I've said, I haven't said it often recently, but over the years I've made this statement,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.600
we're as close to God today as we want to be.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.360
We've spent as much time today with God as we've wanted to.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.300
You say, well, you don't understand my schedule.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.300
Some of you will know the businessman J.C.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:29.700
Penny, he was a very strong Christian man, and he made the statement once that if you

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:36.660
have too much business going on that you cannot spend time with the Lord and you cannot attend

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.860
church regularly, then you have more business than God intended you to have.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.460
I thought that was a pretty good quote from J.C.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.500
Penny, understanding some of those things.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:55.060
The reality this evening is that the amount of time that we spend with the Lord is crucial,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:00.220
that we have that fellowship with Him, that we enter into His presence.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.340
See, it's not going to prevent the hardship from coming.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.340
I wish I could tell you that it would.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.340
I really do.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.300
I wish there was a formula that just said, if you do these things, then it's going to

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.300
prevent that from happening.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.380
But the Bible says, yea, they that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.900
We see it here with these guys in Acts chapter 4.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.860
So we understand that spending time in communion with the Lord, that fellowship that we have,

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.660
even though it's a privilege and we love to be able to enter into His presence, it's not

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.940
going to prevent that hardship, but I'll tell you one thing, it's going to prepare you for

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.940
it.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:40.820
Again, I wish I could prevent it, but I'm understanding that I'm not able to do that.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:46.460
And through the hardship, as I've spent time with the Lord and we can be prepared to face

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.900
whatever that hardship is, then God is able to be glorified.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.220
God is able to work miraculously.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.620
Souls are able to be saved, lives are able to be changed, we're able to be developed.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.260
I mean, it's amazing what God can do.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:10.180
I hate to think about what the recognition would have been in the book of Acts and even

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:17.620
other portions of Scripture as we look at some of the amazing ways in which the people

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:25.020
of God responded to hardship by showing in their response, giving evidence to the fact

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.460
that they have spent time with God.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.500
I'd hate to think how some of it would read if they had not spent time with God.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.300
I'm so thankful for the privilege.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.300
Sometimes we take things for granted, don't we?

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.220
I was listening to somebody talk the other day and they kept using this phraseology of

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:55.860
someday, someday, sometime, and then they said this, you know what I found out in my life?

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.260
Someday just never comes.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260
Sometime just never comes.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.700
If I'm going to have fellowship with God, I better plan to have fellowship with God.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.300
It's not going to happen on accident.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.300
Amen?

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.540
And this evening we see they had been with Jesus.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540
What a joy.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:18.660
And this evening, understand the privilege, take advantage of the opportunity that God

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.700
has given us to enter into his presence and understand how he prepares us for those hardships

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.740
of life.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.740
Let's pray.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.740
Father, we love you.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.940
We thank you for loving us.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.020
Thank you for the example of Peter and John.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:43.380
Thank you for recording for us the response of these religious leaders.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:51.020
God, I pray this evening you'd help us to recognize the privilege of spending time with

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.100
you, our fellowship with you, our prayer time, our Bible reading.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.260
Oh God, I pray that you'd help each one of us.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:12.340
Help me, Lord, to protect that time, to understand how vital that time is.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:19.620
Pray God that as we enter into your presence and enjoy that fellowship with you, that you

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:27.220
would give us joy, hope, peace, boldness.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.540
God that you'd help us to be prepared for the difficulties and challenges, the hardships

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.260
that will come in our lives.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.300
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.500
We thank you for the privilege.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.340
What a joy it is to engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.500
I pray that you'd be glorified through all that's said and done.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.900
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.900
All right, let me give you a couple of things here.
