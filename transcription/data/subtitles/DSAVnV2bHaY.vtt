00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
a great song this evening to be able to sing.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.800
Thank the Lord for the old hymns of the faith.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.840
Amen. And what a blessing how they encourage us and strengthen us

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.979
and prepare us for the truth from his word.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.279
Genesis chapter 37.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.120
A couple of weeks ago, we had an introduction to the life of Joseph.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.920
We looked at the first few verses here of Genesis chapter 37, verses one through four.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.319
And in that introductory message, we noted some aspects of Joseph's childhood.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.280
And then we examined some aspects of his character.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.159
And we noted that though Joseph was a young man, he was a man of character.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.619
And I'm thankful for some people of character.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:43.060
I'm thankful for young people that have character.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:48.200
And character is so important in our society today.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.840
We find in many places that it's lacking.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.939
But what a blessing to have young people of character.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:56.139
Joseph was a man of character.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.040
As we study through Genesis chapter number 37 again,

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:03.599
not much is mentioned specifically about the childhood of Joseph.

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:05.779
There's just a few aspects that we're able to go to.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.339
And then we read of that event last time that we looked at the start,

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.819
Genesis 37, where he's there and he's working with his brothers there.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.260
And what have you, as we looked in verse number two and three

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.080
and all that was going on.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.160
And then we find the very next event that is dealt with are the dreams of Joseph.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.059
And I've simply titled the message this evening,

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:32.819
the dreams of Joseph from Genesis 37, verses five through 11.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.699
Notice with me and let me just remind you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.540
that Joseph was hated by his brothers.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.540
Remember, Joseph was the favorite.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.599
We talked about the dysfunctional family.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.139
The Bible tells us in verse number three.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.739
Now, Israel, the father there, Israel loved Joseph more than all his children

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:53.720
because he was the son of his old age.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.620
And he made him a coat of many colors.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.419
And so every time they would see Joseph wearing that coat, it was a reminder

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.980
not only as to the love that Jacob had for him,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.419
but also the position in which Joseph would have as being heir.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.320
And we find that it caused the brothers great distress.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.059
It says in verse four, when his brethren saw that their father loved him

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.539
more than all his brethren.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:22.800
Notice the Bible says that they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.660
And if you think it couldn't get worse, it does.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.259
In verse number five, the Bible says this.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.259
And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren notice

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.360
and they hated him yet the more.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.539
They already hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.940
According to verse number four, they hear the dream

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.740
and the Bible says that they hated him yet the more he said unto them

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.520
in verse number six.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880
Here, I pray you this dream, which I have dreamed.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.080
For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field and low.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.399
My sheaf arose and also stood upright.

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.979
Behold, your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.539
and his brethren said unto him, Shout thou indeed reign over us

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.779
or shout thou indeed have dominion over us.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:11.119
And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.520
And he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520
Behold, I have dreamed a dream more.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.720
And behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obedience to me.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.979
And he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.940
and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.080
Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.320
to thee, to the earth?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.580
And his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.960
As we look at this portion of Scripture, I want you to consider

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.759
three thoughts with me this evening.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.559
We'll seek to make some application as we get to the end of the message

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.600
this evening, but consider with me, first of all, what God was revealing.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.360
Consider what God was revealing.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.080
There are two dreams that are mentioned here that Joseph has.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.460
And the first dream is outlined for us in verses five through seven.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.039
We understand that in this first dream,

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.580
but it's specifically dealing with Joseph and his brethren, the eleven brothers.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.320
And in this first dream, we find the Bible says that they're binding sheaves

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.660
in the field. This is the dream that Joseph has.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.260
And his sheaf arose and stood upright and their sheaves

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.959
all stood round about and did obeisance.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.779
And we begin to consider what God was revealing to Joseph

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.440
through this, his first dream.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.040
And he shares that dream and it's understood what's taking place.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.839
And then Joseph has a second dream.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.220
That second dream is outlined for us in verse number nine, as we read a moment ago.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.660
And in this particular dream, it's not just the eleven brethren.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.720
It's also mother and father.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:46.059
And we would understand that Rachel has died.

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.260
And so no doubt this would be a reference to Leah.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.359
In this particular text and dealing with that.

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:58.000
And we find that now he says that the sun and the moon and the eleven stars

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.779
representing the eleven brothers did made obeisance to him

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:07.220
and begin to think about what God was revealing, what God was making known

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.579
to Joseph, what was to come to pass in Joseph's life.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.579
He was making known to Joseph the future events

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.920
that would take place in Joseph's life and how those

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.619
how it would relate with his brothers and so on and so forth.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.540
And we find that these dreams are given by the Lord.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.799
Now, we understand that prior to the Bible being completed,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.739
that there are many examples in God's word of those that receive revelation

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:37.440
from God through dreams or visions.

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.119
And we can read of that and we can understand that.

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:44.679
We can see within the context of Scripture how that God would be revealing

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.880
things, events, future happenings through dreams and visions.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.119
We've been studying the life of Samuel in Sunday school.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.980
And as we're studying through his life and we're mindful of the fact

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.079
that the Lord is calling to Samuel, there's no vision in that time.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.959
There's no open revelation from the Lord.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.100
And God calls to Samuel.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.299
And we've mentioned this before, but we dealt with it in Sunday school

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:13.260
that Samuel is instructed by Eli to say, speak, Lord,

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.320
for thy servant heareth.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.100
And we find that Samuel obeys the instruction that Eli provided.

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:23.799
And he said, speak for thy servant hereth, according to First Samuel

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.399
three in verse number ten.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:30.899
And there God speaks to Samuel and says, I will do a thing in Israel.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.279
And he reveals to Samuel what he God is going to do in the future.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.579
And we find that God would work.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:42.720
And there are many other examples that we could look to this evening

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.179
with regard to God revealing to his people his plans

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:52.660
with regard to the future, using dreams and visions.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.160
Now, understand that those dreams and visions

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.320
never equate to having salvation.

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:05.260
And there's a circumstance today that people talk about receiving dreams

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.540
and visions and so on and so forth.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.380
And I've had conversation with people in various times

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.299
where I'd ask them if they're going to heaven when they die.

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:17.299
And I get a variety of answers when I ask that question.

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:19.739
And some say yes, because they've been baptized.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.440
Some say yes, because they have spoken in tongues.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.519
And some say yes, because they're part of some church and so on and so forth.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:30.019
And because I'm a good person and I hope so and I'm doing the best that I can.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.579
And some have said, yes, I've been born again.

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:35.700
I've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior.

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:38.299
I've been saved. I've been born again.

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:40.500
And hallelujah. When that answer comes.

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:43.559
Some, however, have told me at different times in my life

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.920
that they've seen a vision, they've had a dream,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.959
and that's why they believe they're going to heaven.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200
Whenever that happens, I immediately go to Acts chapter number 10

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.140
and talk about a man by the name of Cornelius.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.040
And Cornelius was a man that was a religious man.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.100
But Cornelius was a man that was lost.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.380
He was a man that prayed fervently.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.380
He was religious, but he was lost.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.279
And God allowed for a vision to be given.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.500
And God spoke to Cornelius.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.040
And what God said to Cornelius was to go and get Peter.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.640
And Peter would give him the words that he needed to have.

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:20.440
In other words, Peter would come and give him the gospel.

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:22.839
And if you read the record of Acts chapter number 10,

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:27.160
and then as it's rehearsed before the the Jews there in Jerusalem

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.459
by Peter to them in chapter number 11, you'll find that Peter shows up

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.200
and Peter preaches the gospel and then Cornelius

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.799
and all that were gathered there, they get saved.

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:41.400
At the preaching of the gospel, not because of a vision or a dream.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.159
And so we see that in this vision, this just these dreams that Joseph is having.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.599
The two that are recorded here in our text of Scripture

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:53.960
that God is making known to Joseph what is going to come to pass.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.880
Now, we understand that God has given us a complete canon of Scripture.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.000
God's given us his word.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.599
And I'm so thankful this evening to have the word of God in its complete form

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.159
and that we can rejoice that we have all of it.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.159
You know, there are some people on the earth today

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:15.960
that do not have any portion of this book in their own language.

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:20.280
It's just simply not available to them in their language.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.320
There are some groups of people that in their own language,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.640
all they have is the New Testament.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:29.280
Now, understand that the New Testament is better than having nothing.

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:33.280
But, you know, as we study our Bibles, as we read through the Scriptures,

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:36.280
can you imagine if all we had was the New Testament?

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:40.400
How much we would miss from not having the Old Testament?

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:43.440
I know there's some people today that say, well, we're New Testament believers.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.039
We really don't need the Old Testament.

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:46.440
They are mistaken.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.840
And they have not understood that even the New Testament itself says

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.919
of the Old Testament that it is written for our learning.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:55.039
It is written for our admonition.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:57.159
And here's what Paul says in the book of Hebrews,

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:59.960
that the law having a shadow of good things.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.200
to come. And if you don't understand, if you don't have the Old Testament, how are you

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.440
understanding the book of Hebrews? I mean it's almost going to be impossible to understand

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.360
the book of Hebrews if you do not have the Old Testament and understanding all that the

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.040
Jews and the practices with regard to the offerings and the sacrifices and what have

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:26.560
you. And we find that God has graciously given us the whole Bible. And what a blessing that

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.200
is. And we find that today God is no longer speaking to us in dreams and visions and it's

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.160
not that we need to try to have some dream or some vision to understand some future event.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.440
No, God is speaking to us through His Word. And by the way, in His Word He's told us about

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.200
some future events. He's told us about some future events that will come to pass. We don't

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.520
know the particular times of some of these events, but we know that they're going to

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.240
come to pass. I want you to notice with me, keep your place here, we'll be back in Genesis

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.360
in just a moment, but go to the Gospel of John if you will. In John chapter number 14,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:08.240
we'll look at John 14 and also at John 16. And I want you to notice what the Lord Jesus

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.320
Christ said to His disciples here in John 14 and then again in John chapter number 16.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.880
I want you to think about the truth of God giving us the entire Bible. Of course even

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.040
as He's speaking to the disciples at this particular time, before He would go to the

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.960
cross of Calvary, they did not have the complete Bible like we have it today. And so they too

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.880
were in a position where they did not have the complete revelation of God. But notice

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.360
what the Bible says in John 14 and verse 25. These things have I spoken unto you, being

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.960
yet present with you. But the Comforter, who is that? It says, which is the Holy Ghost.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.840
Aren't you thankful for the Holy Ghost? And I'm so thankful. The moment of salvation,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.160
the Bible teaches us that the Holy Ghost, the third person of the Trinity, of the Godhead,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.440
takes up residence within us. And we don't need to be scared about preaching or teaching

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.040
about the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit. It is biblical, it is understood that God has

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.680
given us the Holy Ghost and the Comforter has come. Notice, which the Father will send

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.720
in my name. I'm so thankful to have the Holy Spirit indwell me and to be indwelled by God's

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.720
Spirit. The Bible says this, He shall teach you, how many things? All things. And bring

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:37.400
all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you. You know that the disciples

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.280
were just like us, they forgot some things. And no doubt you've forgotten some things

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.400
in your life and the disciples, they had forgotten some things and the Holy Spirit

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.400
of God will remind them. I've mentioned this before and what a blessing it is and how important

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.360
it is that we're in God's Word every day of our lives. Why? Because then the Holy Spirit

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.600
of God can remind us of some biblical truth. You go through circumstances in your life,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.720
you have difficulties, you have somebody that brings up a question and because you've been

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.960
in God's Word, because you've studied it and you've read it, then the Holy Spirit of God

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.680
can remind you and can guide you and can teach you what you need to be able to say. What

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.000
a blessing. But listen, if you're not in the Word, if there's nothing there, how's He gonna

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.840
remind you of it? You never read it, I don't know it, I'm unaware of it. No, we're in the

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.920
book, we're studying it, we're learning it, we're hearing it, we're reading it, and we're

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.240
examining it and the Bible says that the Holy Spirit of God, that He's going to teach

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.520
us all things and He's gonna bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I've said unto you.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:53.200
Notice in chapter 16, notice what the Lord says. In verse number 12 of John 16, Jesus

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.880
says, I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. You know, I'm

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.720
thankful that God has infinite wisdom. And I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us as

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.520
newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby. And then

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.440
you read where the Bible talks about strong meat in Hebrews chapter number five and six

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.880
and you read over there and you understand that the Bible would teach us and give us

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:27.600
the truth with regard to our spiritual diet and our spiritual growth. And it's interesting

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.960
because in Hebrews chapter number five, He says this in verse number 11, of whom we have

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.160
many things to say. Now listen, Jesus said, I have yet many things to say unto you, but

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.720
ye cannot bear them now. He says that to the disciples in John 16 in verse number 12. And

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.240
then I believe Paul wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, the book of Hebrews.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.080
And Paul says this to these that he's writing to, of whom we have many things to say and

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.840
hard to be uttered. Why? Seeing your dull of hearing. For when for the time you ought

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.640
to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which would be the first principles

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.560
of the oracles of God and to become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.520
For everyone that is, useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.800
but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age. Even those by who, who by reason

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.800
of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. God and His infinite wisdom

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.800
has determined how we grow as believers. Listen, I didn't know everything the day after I got

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.600
saved that I know today. I didn't understand the day I trust that Christ is my savior,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:49.760
August 31st, 1997. I did not in that moment understand everything that happened in salvation.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.620
I didn't, I didn't understand it. And I'm sure that you didn't understand it either.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.740
And I didn't know about the words justified and reconciled and all of those things. I

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.260
didn't know that he is our propitiation. I didn't know those Bible words. I wasn't familiar

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:11.420
with those truths and I didn't understand the great transaction that took place. And

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.580
then as I begin to grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ, I begin

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.620
to learn more and more and more about what happened on that day that I got saved. And

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.620
I learn more about my savior and we're growing. And notice the Bible says in John 16, verse

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.540
12, I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.660
he, the spirit of truth, this is the Holy spirit, the Holy ghost is come. He will guide

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:45.660
you into what's at say all truth for he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:52.900
hear that shall he speak. And he will show you what's at say things to come, huh? He's

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.340
going to show us things to come. How's he going to show us things to come through his

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.500
word, through his word. You know, it's interesting that Jesus said to the disciples in John 14,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.900
let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me and my father's

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.420
house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.300
for you. And if I go, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.180
you may be also. And so we find that there in John 14, verses one through three, Jesus

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.420
was speaking about leaving, ascending to heaven after the, uh, the, the resurrection, the

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.180
crucifixion and the resurrection, he'd ascend to heaven. And then he would come again. The

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.860
timeline was unknown, but the disciples received that. And as you study the remainder of the,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:44.260
uh, the new Testament, as the books are written, as the revelation is given, we begin to understand

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.260
about the rapture. We begin to understand about the second coming and we understand

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.780
about the tribulation and about eternity, the millennial and so on and so forth. And

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:59.780
we understand these things to come. What a glorious truth. The disciples in Acts chapter

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.100
number one, before the ascension, they say, are you going to set up your kingdom? He says,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.620
it's not for you to know. Right? But then he begins to give us revelation and we have

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.660
the whole canon of scripture. And one of the things that God shows us, I want you to make

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:23.900
this connection this evening, is he will show you things to come. What is God showing Joseph

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.700
in these dreams? Things to come. He's showing Joseph some things that are going to come

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:36.300
to pass in Joseph's life and in the lives of his family. Of course, we understand the

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.059
fulfillment because we know the account of the book of Genesis and we understand in the

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:45.740
life of Joseph how that he would be sold into slavery and how he would take after being

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.700
imprisoned and go and be second in command and all that would take place. We understand,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.179
we're familiar with the life of Joseph, but in this particular moment, I don't think Joseph

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:02.220
understood all that these dreams meant. I don't think the brothers understood all that

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:08.300
these dreams meant, but there was enough in the dreams to know. We're going to note here

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:15.740
not only what God was revealing, but consider with me number two, what his family recognized.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.540
Through God giving these dreams, there was a recognition on the part of the brethren

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.619
for sure. And we see also on the part of Israel or Jacob, we find that the Bible says, notice

00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:31.700
in verse number eight of Genesis 37, after Joseph shares that first dream with them in

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.500
verse number seven, in verse number eight, notice what his brothers say, shalt thou indeed,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:47.420
notice what they say, reign over us. They recognized some of what this dream meant.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:54.340
They were picking up on the fact that his sheaf arose and then there it stood upright

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.100
and then their sheaves stood round about and did obeisance. They were tracking, they

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.940
were understanding.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.640
and they say, shalt thou indeed reign over us.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.600
Now, Joseph is younger than these boys, isn't he?

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.520
We know that Benjamin is younger than Joseph,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.080
but the other 11 are older than Joseph.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.880
And culturally speaking, there's no way

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.080
they're gonna bow down to their younger brother.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.200
And we find that the Bible says in verse number eight,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.200
or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.200
Begin to recognize what God is revealing

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.820
through these dreams.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.980
Notice what their response was that says,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.060
and we'll get to it in just a moment in its entirety,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.180
but they hated him yet the more for his dreams

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.020
and his words.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.500
We know not only how the brothers responded

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.180
or what they recognized there in verse number eight,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.660
but notice what his father, how his father,

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.380
what he recognized, the Bible says that he told his father,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.780
this is with the second dream and his brethren,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.160
and his father rebuked him and said,

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.200
notice what he says, what is this dream

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.160
that thou hast dreamed?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.760
By the way, I'm not sure that Joseph could have

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.240
concocted the dream himself.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.200
You know, you ever, you can't control what you dream,

00:21:09.779 --> 00:21:12.920
especially in the context of this dream

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.540
with regard to God revealing to Joseph

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.160
what was going to happen.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.920
We find that his father says,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.560
what is this dream that thou hast dreamed?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.560
Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.959
to bow down ourselves to thee, to the earth?

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.100
I want you to see what they recognized.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.420
They recognized that God was revealing

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.180
what was eventually gonna come to pass.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.620
I would submit to you this evening

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.660
that they didn't like it.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.340
They didn't like it.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.620
And we note that in our third point this evening

00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:53.400
when we consider how his brothers responded,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.840
I've already made mention to verse number eight

00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:59.200
where the Bible says at the end of the verse

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.560
that they hated him yet the more for his dreams

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.319
and for his words.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.920
There are some Bible commentators,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.760
in fact, depending on the particular Bible that you have,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.119
if you have notes within your Bible

00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:13.040
that's a study Bible of some sort,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.600
if you read some commentaries,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.559
there are many commentators that give Joseph,

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:20.260
I believe, disservice in this passage of Scripture

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.419
and they say that Joseph was not right

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:23.860
for telling his dreams.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.900
I don't see that in the text of Scripture.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.260
If you just read the Bible,

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.800
I don't think that Joseph was wrong in telling the dreams.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.419
Joseph is making known to his brothers

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:39.440
that which had been revealed to him

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.639
and we find that the response of the brothers,

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:44.180
they hate him.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.580
They hate him yet the more the Bible says

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.080
for his dreams and for his words.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.000
Now remember, they already hated him so much

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.979
that they could not speak peaceably unto him.

00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:55.240
I can't imagine this relationship getting any worse

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.360
than what it was, but we find that it says yet the more.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.720
His brethren envied him according to verse number 11.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.000
The Bible tells us that his father observed the saying.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.880
Begin to think about this portion of Scripture

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.279
and I've already tried to make some parallel

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:13.000
as we've looked at some New Testament truth this evening

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.500
and as we begin to understand how God is working

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.160
in Joseph's life through these two dreams

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.839
and what God is revealing, what he's making known

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:22.400
that's going to come to pass,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.199
the reality this evening is that God has given us the Bible

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.279
and he's given us the complete canon of Scripture

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:32.720
and there's some things that you know as a child of God,

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.220
someone that's been born again,

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.860
someone that believes in the authority of this book,

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.119
there's some things that you know about the future

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:40.639
that other people don't know

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.380
and God wants us to tell him.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.820
God wants us to tell him.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.779
God expects, in fact, God has commanded us to be witnesses.

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:56.860
God has commanded us to go and to preach the gospel

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.020
to every creature.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.380
God has commanded us and I look at the Scriptures

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.419
and I look at the testimony of those that walked

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:04.600
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.619
I think about John in 1 John chapter number one

00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:09.419
if you want to turn there very quickly

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:11.839
and I want you to notice what John says.

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:14.520
It really is similar to what you read of the disciples

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.440
in the book of Acts as they're testifying

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.239
and as they're going forth and proclaiming the truth

00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:21.920
but we see it here in 1 John chapter number one.

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:35.320
In 1 John chapter number one, the Bible says this,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.239
that beginning in verse number one,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.100
that which was from the beginning which we have heard,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.839
which we have seen with our eyes,

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:44.739
which we have looked upon and our hands have handled

00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:47.299
of the word of life, for the life was manifested

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:49.459
and we have seen it and bear witness

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:51.779
and show unto you that eternal life

00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:54.700
which was with the Father and was manifested unto us.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.540
That which we have seen and heard,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.179
notice those next words, declare we unto you

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:02.940
that you also may have fellowship with us

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.059
and truly our fellowship is with the Father

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:06.700
and with his son Jesus Christ.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.160
It's said this way in Acts four in verse number 20,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.160
the disciples say for we cannot but speak the things

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.880
which we have seen and heard.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.959
Oh that God would give us a measure of that type of courage,

00:25:19.959 --> 00:25:23.160
a measure of that type of boldness that we would say

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.880
and echo the words of John and of the disciples

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.399
here in Acts chapter number four where we would say

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:31.000
we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:34.399
The Bible tells us about Elijah

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.860
and we studied the life of Elijah,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.940
the beginning of his life this morning

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.220
through providing an obvious example of God's care

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.140
for his children, for his servants

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.739
and you notice that as you study through the life of Elijah

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:49.580
that you come to a place where God has revealed to Elijah

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.739
some future events that are going to take place.

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:55.360
The Bible tells us that Elijah's response to that

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.899
is that he wept.

00:25:56.899 --> 00:25:58.260
In fact, the Bible says it this way,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.700
the man of God wept.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.660
What caused him to weep?

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:03.779
Well that which had been revealed to him.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760
I want you to begin to think about this evening

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.480
as we would try to, yes, we understand the historical

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.519
context of what God is doing through these dreams

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:14.440
in Genesis chapter number 37

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.200
and we see what God was revealing,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.640
we see what was recognized,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.600
we see the response of his brothers in particular

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.239
and their hatred for him

00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:24.000
but I want you to understand this evening

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.700
that God has revealed truth to you and to me.

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:29.399
He's given us truth.

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:31.899
One day the trumpet of the Lord is going to sound.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.540
One day, every single person that we know

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.399
is gonna stand before God Almighty.

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:43.420
Is that true or not?

00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:47.899
One day, every single person that you know

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:50.000
and that I know is gonna stand before God.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.100
The Bible describes for us two judgments.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.679
There's a judgment that's referred to as the bema seat

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:00.980
or the judgment seat of Christ

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.880
and that's the place where I'll stand.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.899
If you're saved tonight,

00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:07.299
that's the place that you'll stand.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:10.339
And thank God we won't stand at the other judgment

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:12.559
but we'll stand at the bema seat of Christ.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.420
The Bible describes for us a judgment

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.420
that is called the great white throne judgment.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.080
And at that judgment, again I'm thankful,

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.700
I won't stand at that judgment.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.260
If you've been born again this evening,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.760
if you've been saved by the blood of Christ,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.440
you will not stand at the great white throne judgment.

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:35.000
That's the authority of God's word,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.640
that's what God tells us.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.559
Who stands at that judgment?

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:44.080
The lost, those that have rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.360
And the Bible tells us that at that judgment

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.519
that death and hell are cast into the lake of fire,

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:51.119
this is the second death.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.320
Revelation 20, 11 through 15 reveals that to us

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.420
of the great white throne judgment.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.360
What a sad day, what a sad judgment.

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:03.779
I would submit to you this evening

00:28:03.779 --> 00:28:05.700
that God has revealed that to us,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.779
he's made that known to us.

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:10.540
Remember the Holy Spirit, John 16,

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.580
Jesus said I have many things to say

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.220
but you're not ready for it yet

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.260
but the spirit is going to come, the spirit of truth.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.019
And when the spirit of truth shall come,

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:20.420
he will guide you into all truth

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.299
and he will show you things to come.

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:25.260
Things to come.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.000
The great white throne judgment is not the next thing

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.960
to come on God's prophetic calendar.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.880
In fact, there are many things that will take place

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.119
before the great white throne judgment.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:40.239
If you're to very quickly understand

00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:41.880
the prophetic calendar of God

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.200
that is revealed to us in his word,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.599
the next event is the rapture.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.559
And then after the rapture,

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.640
there's seven years of tribulation.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.440
And just looking at the high points

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.280
after the seven years of tribulation,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.000
you'd find that there's the millennial reign of Christ.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.859
And then after the millennial reign of Christ

00:28:56.859 --> 00:29:00.099
is when you read of the great white throne judgment.

00:29:00.099 --> 00:29:01.380
Those are just hitting the high points

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.140
very quickly in the book of Revelation.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.020
There are many other events that are described

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.020
that we could look to,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.179
but you find that those are the high points

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.260
on God's prophetic calendar.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.700
But what I'm saying to you this evening

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.380
is that God's revealed that to us.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.179
But why has he revealed it to us?

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:20.000
So that we tell somebody, so they could be prepared.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.099
But here's what I would submit to you this evening.

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:25.580
Sometimes they're gonna respond to you

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.380
the same way that the 11 brothers responded to Joseph.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.020
With hatred.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.260
With hatred.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.859
With animosity.

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.340
With unkindness.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.220
With whatever other word you wanna use to describe it.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.900
But we find that, listen,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.979
the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.599
which believe not.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:53.479
We're engaged in spiritual warfare and spiritual battle.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:56.640
And listen, people don't like hearing the truth.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.880
And there are many times we find today.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.280
that people have believed a lie.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.120
And they've believed it so much

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.600
that there's no room for the truth.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.720
And they can get so angry at you

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.760
or at me as the messenger.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.880
The brothers were so angry with Joseph,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.400
and even his father rebuked him for the dream.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400
I've been told so many things over the years

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.400
and I try to share truth with people.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.680
I remember hearing somebody say,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.440
oh, two things you should never talk about,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440
politics and religion.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.320
How many ever heard somebody say that?

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.040
Can I tell you, here's what I believe,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.560
and I'm only 42 years old,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.720
but here's what I believe,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.240
that if we didn't believe that about 70 years ago,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.920
our world would be different today.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.240
But about 70 years ago,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.160
it was commonly believed that it wasn't appropriate

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.480
to talk about politics and religion,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.760
and so we stopped talking about those two subjects

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.280
and we probably wouldn't be in the mess

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.480
that we're in today

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.960
if we would've kept talking about politics and religion.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.480
I'm not preaching politics tonight,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.800
I'm just saying that we took those two things out

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.920
and said, no, you can't talk about those two things.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.080
I'd much rather talk about,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.040
and it's not religion,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.440
it's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.080
Man, we need to talk about Jesus and to tell others why,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.920
because they're gonna stand before God one day.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.680
Here's what God says to Ezekiel.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.680
I've called you to be a watchman.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.920
I've called you to be a watchman.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.280
You can read it in chapter three

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.800
and then again in chapter 33,

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.800
and God says to Ezekiel that you give them warning.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.640
And if you warn them, you've done your part.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.760
How they respond to the warning,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.720
that's completely on them.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.600
But you warn them, you warn them.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.560
If the watchman fails to sound the horn,

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.800
the trumpet, and danger is coming,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.480
then the responsibility falls upon the watchman.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.160
And I wanna remind you of what the Apostle Paul said

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.440
in Acts chapter number 20,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.919
and we'll close with this tonight.

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:12.559
Listen, Paul was a man that knew the Old Testament.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.440
Paul knew the Old Testament.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.240
Paul was trained, learned at the feet of Gamaliel.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.720
He was learned.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.120
And then he got born again, hallelujah.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.840
Because as religious as he was and as zealous as he was,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.520
he was lost, but in Acts 9, he got saved.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.639
And we come to Acts chapter number 20,

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:38.360
and we find that Paul is preaching

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.840
and he's giving the truth.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.120
And here in Acts chapter number 20,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.400
he comes and he's called the Ephesian church leaders

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.840
together to be able to speak with them.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.200
And I want you to notice in verse number 24,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.160
he says, but none of these things move me,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.000
neither count I my life dear unto myself,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.919
so that I might finish my course with joy

00:32:56.919 --> 00:32:59.760
in the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.919
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:05.320
And now behold, I know that ye all,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.840
among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.440
shall see my face no more.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.680
Wherefore, I take you to record this day,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.080
notice what Paul says,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.419
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.200
Why does he say that?

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.320
Notice verse 27, for I have not shunned

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.320
to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.720
He says, I'm gonna skip down for sake of time in verse 31.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.860
He says, therefore, watch and remember

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.559
that by the space of three years,

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.800
notice how he describes this,

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.120
I ceased not to what?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.120
To warn everyone night and day with tears.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.080
Paul, why did you have tears?

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.800
Because there was something that Paul understood

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.720
that God had revealed to him that was going to take place.

00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:57.960
And this evening, when we look at this account

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.240
from Genesis 37, you say, man,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.880
I didn't expect all this tonight.

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:06.940
Some dreams of Joseph and what God was revealing to Joseph

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.139
about some future events in the life of Joseph

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:14.480
and his family as God's people.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.559
I no longer need a dream or a vision.

00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:20.360
I have God's completed book, the Bible.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.660
And in God's completed book, the Bible,

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.700
he has given me truth concerning things to come.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.679
And oh, that God would give us a passion

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:35.279
to tell someone else about these things to come.

00:34:35.279 --> 00:34:38.000
Because many people, they have no idea.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
They're just living life, let come what may.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.440
What's gonna happen when we die?

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.119
I have no idea, I'll think about it then.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:52.720
No, no, that's the wrong answer.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.000
It's too late then, it's too late.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Philippians tells us that every knee shall bow

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.920
and every tongue shall confess.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.140
That is going to happen.

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:16.800
How much better for it to happen on this side of eternity

00:35:17.839 --> 00:35:20.459
and to forever be with the Lord?

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.459
This evening, we see the dreams of Joseph.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.480
We don't need to have a dream,

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.339
we just need to read the book.

00:35:28.339 --> 00:35:31.239
As we read the book, God reveals to us

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:33.320
and then it's our responsibility to tell some other people

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.239
about what's going to happen, what's gonna happen.

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:37.399
You know, there's people who run around,

00:35:37.399 --> 00:35:38.720
what's gonna happen with this

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.839
and what's gonna happen with that

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:42.440
and how's this gonna work and what's this gonna do?

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:45.160
People have lost their way.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.480
I got an email yesterday, there's a church overseas

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.000
that they decided to have a full service

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.739
guided and directed by chat GPT.

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:57.160
That's nonsense.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.399
We got the Bible.

00:35:59.399 --> 00:36:02.059
We don't need artificial intelligence.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.520
We got God's word.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.980
People have lost their way.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.980
They have no idea and yet we have God's authoritative word.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.119
Oh, that God would give us boldness and courage.

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:19.179
I think Joseph had to have a lot of boldness and courage

00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:21.679
to tell his brothers what he dreamed.

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:25.399
Do you remember when Samuel received the revelation from God?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.640
As soon as he woke up in the morning,

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.239
I think Samuel tried to get busy

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.080
and Eli said, Samuel, Samuel, what did God say to you?

00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:39.360
That was the last question he wanted to be asked

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.040
and Eli says, tell me all of it.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.200
Hide nothing from me.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.080
I understand that Joseph needed to have some courage

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.440
and some boldness and so do we.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.119
Here's the wonderful truth.

00:36:59.959 --> 00:37:00.800
You know what Jesus said?

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.200
All power is given unto me in heaven and earth

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.520
and then he said this, I'll be with you.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.559
I'll be with you.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.279
He'll give us that courage and that boldness.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.399
Oh, that God would give us the right disposition

00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:19.200
to be able to give the truth in love,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.480
to let people know, listen, I'm telling you this

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.360
because I care about you, because I love you,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.600
because I want you to know the truth

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.959
because one day, you're gonna stand before God.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.000
Let's pray together.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.959
Father, we love you.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.559
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.320
I thank you for the Bible.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.160
Thank you for the life of Joseph and his courage

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.160
and boldness to share these dreams.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.600
As you revealed to him, to his brethren,

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.119
the things that were going to happen,

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.119
I thank you this evening

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.920
that you've given us the whole Bible

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.520
and I pray that as we have the opportunity

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.520
to be students of your word,

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.440
to attend a church that faithfully preaches your word,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.920
God, you said to whom much is given, much is required

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.119
and I pray that you'd help us to go on the power

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:14.239
of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:16.839
help us to go with boldness and courage and love

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.160
to a lost and dying world of things to come.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.480
Every single person that we know one day

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.679
will stand before you.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.080
God, would you help us to be mindful of that truth

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.359
as we go throughout our week,

00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:34.160
as we interact with individuals,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.679
help us to not be intimidated by their position,

00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:41.679
by their possessions, by any status that they might have

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.039
but Lord, help us to go in the power of the Holy Spirit.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.880
I pray that you'd use us for your honor and for your glory.

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.760
I pray that you'd move during this time of invitation.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.599
Lord, maybe you've convicted some, challenged some.

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:02.599
Lord, I pray that we'd be responsive to your word tonight.

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:04.239
We'll thank you for every decision that's made

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:05.640
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.200
Would you stand with me?

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.840
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:11.760
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano tonight

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000
and maybe you wanna come to this old fashioned altar.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.960
Maybe you wanna thank God that he's given you his word,

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.359
that he saved your soul.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.640
Maybe this evening you wanna come and commit to the Lord

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.039
that you with his power, with his help,

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:26.080
are determining that you wanna be a witness

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.000
and tell others of things to come.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.200
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.200
