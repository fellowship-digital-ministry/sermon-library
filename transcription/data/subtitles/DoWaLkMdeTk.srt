1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
And I'm actually gonna preach a couple of messages today,

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,440
both this morning and this evening

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,000
in preparation for our annual missions conference.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,800
And as you know, as I mentioned

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,520
by way of announcements this morning,

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,239
that our missions conference begins

7
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,879
on Saturday of this week.

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,319
And we're excited about it.

9
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,120
Over the five days of our conference,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,840
we will have a purposed focus on the responsibility

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,399
that God has given to his people

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,780
to reach the world with the gospel.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,379
There are many who have never heard

14
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,819
the name of Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:34,979
They do not know that their sins can be forgiven.

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,180
They do not know the power of the gospel.

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,819
And we have a responsibility biblically

18
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:44,220
to take the gospel to every creature.

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,500
We have a responsibility here in our local Jerusalem,

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,860
in our local area to reach our community

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,180
to be the light that God has given us to be here.

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,639
We seek to regularly go out with purpose

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,340
to reach people.

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,319
We have gospel tracks that we encourage you to take

25
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:05,279
on a weekly basis as you leave here

26
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:07,599
and try to engage people with the gospel

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,239
and the personal contacts that you will have.

28
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,919
We have organized visitation and outreach

29
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,040
for the purpose of strategically

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,160
and systematically reaching our Jerusalem

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,680
with the gospel.

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,620
And so we are thankful for the opportunities

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,239
that God has given us.

34
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,879
But we understand that we think about world missions,

35
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,199
that we have a responsibility to reach the entire world.

36
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:34,339
And we do that through supporting missionaries.

37
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,900
Of course, we have our missions map on the wall.

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,800
We give you regularly updates from our missionaries

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,160
so that you can stay informed

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,879
and understand how you can pray for them

41
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,400
and with them about the ministry

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
that God has called them to.

43
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,720
And then we have the opportunity, of course,

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,720
to give to missions so that we can invest personally

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,559
in these missionaries being able to go

46
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,040
and take the gospel to the field

47
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,519
that God has called them to.

48
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,440
This particular missions conference,

49
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,760
we'll have a missionary that's going

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,879
to the country of Spain.

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,880
We already have one missionary in the country of Spain,

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,399
but there's a need for more than just one missionary

53
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,520
in that country.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Of course, there are many missionaries there

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,199
that I know of.

56
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,839
And so we're looking forward to having this missionary

57
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,679
join us.

58
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,880
And we have another missionary going to the country

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
of the Netherlands.

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,699
We do not actively currently have any missionaries

61
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,440
that we support in the Netherlands.

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,800
And so we're excited about having another region,

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,479
another area where we possibly can partner together

64
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,360
and have the opportunity to see what God will do there

65
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,240
in that part of the world.

66
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,759
Over the past couple of Sunday evenings,

67
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,259
I've shared some things that God has laid on my heart.

68
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,520
If you've been here the last two weeks

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,720
with regard to being spiritually prepared

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,919
for this special meeting, this missions conference,

71
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,119
from the life of Moses in Exodus chapter number three,

72
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,160
two weeks ago, we learned this valuable truth

73
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,160
that God has a plan and God's plan includes his people.

74
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,399
And I'm so thankful that our God loves the entire world.

75
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,639
I'm thankful that he loves me.

76
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,080
His love is a global yet individual love.

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,520
He loves us as individuals, but he loves the entire world.

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
And we find that God has a plan.

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,960
He's given us in his word, the plan to reach the world,

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,039
but he uses his people.

81
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,639
When we looked at the life of Moses

82
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,880
in Exodus chapter number three,

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,919
God had a plan to deliver his people from Egypt,

84
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,880
but he was gonna use Moses to facilitate

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,199
the work that God would do.

86
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,199
Last week on Sunday evening from the life of Gideon,

87
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,720
we learned that every one of us has a place

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,360
and the importance of being in our place.

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Every man in his place was the title last week.

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,740
And we had the opportunity to look at that portion

91
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,300
of scripture and to see the obedience and the submission,

92
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,139
the courage and the obedience that those men displayed,

93
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,679
those 300 men of Gideon's army.

94
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,580
This morning as we travel to the book of Mark

95
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,059
in the second chapter, we really take a journey

96
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,440
to Capernaum and we learn a valuable lesson

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,059
or really valuable lessons from this miraculous event

98
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:11,220
that is recorded in Mark chapter number two.

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,660
Now, many of us are familiar with this portion

100
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,919
of scripture, but let me read it to you.

101
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,519
We'll dig into the message this morning.

102
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,700
The Bible says in verse number one,

103
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,540
and again, he, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

104
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,179
entered into Capernaum after some days.

105
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,459
Notice verse number one continues and says,

106
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,040
and it was noised that he, Christ, was in the house.

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,380
And straightway many were gathered together

108
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,140
in so much that there was no room to receive them.

109
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,260
No, not so much as about the door.

110
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,980
And he, Christ, preached the word unto them.

111
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,140
What a message it must have been.

112
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,660
And to think about the Lord Jesus Christ

113
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,100
teaching and preaching here in Capernaum at this house.

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,500
And the Bible says in verse number three,

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,980
and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy,

116
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,779
which was born of four.

117
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,160
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press,

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,059
they uncovered the roof where he was.

119
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,899
And when they had broken it up,

120
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,019
they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

121
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,820
When Jesus saw their faith,

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,299
he said unto the sick of the palsy,

123
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:22,019
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

124
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,940
But there were certain of the scribes sitting there

125
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,820
and reasoning in their hearts.

126
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,100
And here's what they say.

127
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,940
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?

128
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,279
Who can forgive sins but God only?

129
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,220
You know, they were right that only God can forgive sin.

130
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Every single human being has a sin problem.

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,859
It's a universal condition.

132
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,459
Outside of the Lord Jesus Christ,

133
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,619
every other human being was born with a sin nature.

134
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,380
And they say this, who can forgive sins but God only?

135
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,260
What they did not understand

136
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,260
and the truth that they resisted, that Jesus is God.

137
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,980
And we find that in verse number eight,

138
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,059
the Bible says immediately when Jesus perceived

139
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,700
in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves,

140
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,820
he said unto them,

141
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,660
why reason ye these things in your hearts?

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,500
Now that must have been pretty confronting

143
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,299
and conflicting for them to know that Jesus is there.

144
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,420
They've not verbalized their thoughts

145
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,380
and Jesus says, why are you thinking this?

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,140
He knows our thoughts, he knows your thoughts.

147
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,500
The Bible says that Jesus continues

148
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,899
and it says to him in verse number nine

149
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,540
or to this group of these religious leaders,

150
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,500
he says, whether is it easier to say

151
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,459
to the sick of the palsy, thy sins be forgiven thee

152
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,459
or to say, arise and take up thy bed and walk.

153
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,380
But that ye may know that the son of man

154
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,579
hath power on earth to forgive sins.

155
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,859
So he's speaking to the religious leaders

156
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:55,420
and then he turns at the end of verse number 10

157
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,100
to the one that was sick of the palsy,

158
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,459
the one that was born of four,

159
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,459
he turns to him as it says at the end of verse number 10,

160
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,859
he saith to the sick of the palsy,

161
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:08,540
I say unto thee, arise, take up thy bed

162
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,260
and go thy way into thine house.

163
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,500
And notice verse 12, it says immediately he arose,

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,220
took up the bed and went forth before them all

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,459
in so much that they were all amazed and glorified God.

166
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,140
Notice what they said, we never saw it on this fashion.

167
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,459
It's a great passage of scripture in Mark chapter number two

168
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,940
I've titled the message this morning,

169
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,859
bringing people to Jesus, bringing people to Jesus.

170
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:37,559
I think that as we look at this portion of scripture,

171
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,459
I note four specific things that I wanna draw

172
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,059
your attention to this morning.

173
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:45,179
Number one, note their concern.

174
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:47,540
Note their concern, when I speak about their concern,

175
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,899
I'm speaking about these four friends

176
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,640
of this man that was sick of the palsy.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,500
We find that these four men are unnamed,

178
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,260
we do not have in the text of scripture before us

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,220
nor in any other gospel record,

180
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,380
the names of these four individuals.

181
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,820
But we find that these four individuals,

182
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,059
though we do not know much about them,

183
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,619
we know from this portion of scripture

184
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,640
that they had concern for this friend

185
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,179
that was sick of the palsy.

186
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,420
We find that this information that God reveals to us

187
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,380
about these four men is powerful truth.

188
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,140
It's important that we recognize the concern that they have,

189
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,420
but we find that as this friend of theirs

190
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,460
is in this grave condition, that they had this concern,

191
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,640
they had care and compassion for this individual.

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,919
We find that as we look at this portion,

193
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,599
the Bible tells us in verse number three,

194
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,799
and when they come unto him,

195
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,799
bringing one sick of the palsy, which was born of four.

196
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,960
We understand from verse number three,

197
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,960
the care, the compassion, the concern

198
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,659
that these friends have for this man

199
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,200
that's sick of the palsy.

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,479
And we begin to understand that this man,

201
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:05,440
he had no ability in of himself to come to Jesus.

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,039
He had no ability to come to the place,

203
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,200
to the house where Jesus was,

204
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,559
where Jesus was preaching and teaching.

205
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,559
He was dependent on someone else bringing him to Jesus.

206
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,440
And I begin to think about the concern

207
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,239
that these men had for their friend

208
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,840
and this concern, of course, leading them to action.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,359
And we this morning must consider

210
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,280
the condition of those around us.

211
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm not speaking this morning of a physical condition.

212
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
And even in the text of scripture,

213
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,840
we see that God deals with both the physical,

214
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
but more importantly, the spiritual.

215
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Not everyone that we come in contact with

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,520
has a physical condition,

217
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,719
like the man described in Mark chapter number two.

218
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,039
Not everyone that we come into contact with

219
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,039
has some type of inability to move into one.

220
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,839
walk as this man has, but we find that every human being

221
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,279
that we come into contact with has a sin condition.

222
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,619
And we find that Jesus, not only does he heal the man

223
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:15,079
physically, but he deals with the sin,

224
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,639
the greatest need of this individual,

225
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,239
and we'll deal with that at the end of the message

226
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,439
this morning, but I want you to understand

227
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:24,159
that when we live life, when we go through life,

228
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,999
when we interact with people, I wonder this morning,

229
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,419
how concerned are we for their souls?

230
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,519
I wonder this morning how our actions reveal our concern.

231
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,739
Because true concern will lead to action.

232
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,619
There was a song that I believe last year

233
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:52,879
during our missions conference, I think it was Brianna

234
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,479
maybe and Holly sang the song,

235
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,919
and it's entitled Someone Cared.

236
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,799
And I just want to read the words to you

237
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,679
as we think about this concern of these four men.

238
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,519
The songwriter of this particular song says,

239
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,479
I was lost without hope, a hope of being found.

240
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:13,519
To sin I was a servant, I was bound.

241
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,999
Life was going nowhere, no matter what I tried.

242
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,779
I searched for peace, but nothing satisfied.

243
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,359
Then someone cared.

244
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,599
Someone cared enough to bring the truth to me.

245
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,759
Someone cared and now my soul is free.

246
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,819
I know it wasn't easy to be bold enough to share,

247
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,899
but I'm so glad someone cared.

248
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,399
Others too are searching for salvation full and free.

249
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,719
Listen, I know that there are times

250
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,259
that we get lots of rejections.

251
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:50,039
People say I'm not interested, I don't want that,

252
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,039
no thank you, so on and so forth.

253
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,999
But there are people that are hurting.

254
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,799
There are people that are in despair.

255
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,319
And they need the hope of the gospel, the truth,

256
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,399
and here the songwriter says others too

257
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,499
are searching for salvation full and free.

258
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:11,999
Won't somebody tell them of the Christ of Calvary?

259
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:16,999
The debt is paid already, but the message must be shared.

260
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,599
Jesus paid it all.

261
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,439
He said it is finished.

262
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,279
But there are people that have never heard the gospel.

263
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,559
They don't know, they need to hear.

264
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,199
Does anybody care, the songwriter says,

265
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,519
and then the chorus, someone cared enough

266
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,119
to bring the truth to me, someone cared,

267
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,979
and now my soul is free.

268
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,199
I know it wasn't easy to be bold enough to share,

269
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:42,359
but I am so glad, oh I am so glad

270
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:46,519
that someone cared enough to bring the truth to me.

271
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,839
It ends with this, do you care?

272
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,839
What a challenging song to hear the songwriter

273
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,839
give that testimony and then end with that question,

274
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,439
do you care?

275
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,399
See here in this passage of scripture,

276
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,319
we are immediately aware of these four individuals,

277
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,319
unnamed people, but they have concern, they have care.

278
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,639
They have a friend who is sick of the palsy

279
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,359
who cannot get to the place where Jesus is.

280
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:22,359
Therefore, they take action

281
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:26,759
and they bring this one to Jesus.

282
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,359
We know, first of all, their concern.

283
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,799
Number two, I want you to note their confidence.

284
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,439
I want you to note their confidence.

285
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,919
As we look in the passage of scripture,

286
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,119
we're told immediately in verse number one

287
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,959
of where they are, they're in Capernaum,

288
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,399
and we find that the Bible tells us

289
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,479
that Jesus is there in Capernaum,

290
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,439
it's a place where he often went

291
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,599
when he was up in the Galilee region,

292
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,119
the northern part of the country.

293
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,719
We find that many times when you study the scriptures,

294
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:54,439
you'll find Jesus in Jerusalem

295
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,439
and the activities that are taking place there,

296
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:57,959
you'll see him up in Galilee,

297
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,159
and Capernaum was a place in which he often would be,

298
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,759
and you find that it's there, it's noised about,

299
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,519
it's made known that Jesus was back in town.

300
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,479
He was in Capernaum, and so these men,

301
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,319
they hear that Jesus is there.

302
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,919
There's no doubt in my mind

303
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,679
that there was no small stir concerning this.

304
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,359
There was a level of excitement.

305
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,479
We find that as news is given

306
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:24,319
that there are many that gather to Jesus.

307
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,879
In fact, in verse number two,

308
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,679
the Bible tells us that there were so many that gathered

309
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,559
that there was no room to receive them.

310
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,679
No, not so much as about the door.

311
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,839
I mean, it's a packed house.

312
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,919
I mean, the people from Capernaum,

313
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,599
they hear that Jesus is there, and they come,

314
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:43,999
and the Bible says that he's preaching the word unto them.

315
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,119
We do not have the content of the message

316
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,519
that Jesus was preaching.

317
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,919
We find in other portions of Scripture

318
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,559
that at times God would give us a record

319
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,639
of the messages that Jesus preached,

320
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,319
but we find that Jesus is teaching and he's preaching,

321
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:03,159
and in the midst of this message, there's an interruption.

322
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,119
The interruption is caused by these four men

323
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,719
that are concerned for their friend.

324
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:12,239
These four men that bring this man that's sick of the palsy,

325
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,479
they cannot get into the home

326
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,519
because of the crowd that's gathered,

327
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,359
and we find that they're interrupting the meeting.

328
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,319
They go upon the roof.

329
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,919
According to verse number four,

330
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,239
when they could not come nigh unto him for the press,

331
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,719
they uncovered the roof where he was,

332
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,439
and we'll deal with the rest of verse number four

333
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,279
in just a moment,

334
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,599
but I want you to consider their confidence.

335
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,759
See, these four men were confident

336
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,439
that Jesus could do something

337
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,059
about the condition of their friend.

338
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:47,479
They had confidence that Jesus was able,

339
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,919
whether it's that they've seen the miracles

340
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,019
that have been performed,

341
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,319
whether it was that they were recipients

342
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,779
of miraculous works.

343
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,399
Maybe it's simply that they heard of the miracles of Jesus.

344
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,879
Whatever it was, they had confidence.

345
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,519
They were convinced that Jesus could do something

346
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,159
about the condition of their friend,

347
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,919
and because of their confidence,

348
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,239
because of their conviction that Jesus was able,

349
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,719
it led them to bring this man

350
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:23,919
that was sick of the palsy to Jesus.

351
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,919
This morning, as we continue to make application

352
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,879
from this passage of Scripture

353
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,599
to our interaction with mankind,

354
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,019
those that God would allow us to interact with

355
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:38,179
on a daily, a regular basis,

356
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,499
I find this morning that we must have concern for them,

357
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,739
but we must have confidence in the power of the gospel.

358
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,319
We must be confident this morning

359
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,239
that God is able to save to the uttermost,

360
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,399
that Jesus saves, amen?

361
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,239
We sang the song this morning, Saved, Saved,

362
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,759
and what a wonderful song it is

363
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,679
to rejoice in the salvation that we have

364
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,399
through the Lord Jesus Christ,

365
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,679
and we find that this morning,

366
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,639
the gospel still is effective today.

367
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,519
The gospel still works.

368
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,159
The Bible tells us that the gospel

369
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,279
is the power of God unto salvation,

370
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,679
to everyone that believe it,

371
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,799
to the Jew first and also to the Greek,

372
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,239
and we find that the gospel, listen,

373
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,919
because of your own personal testimony this morning,

374
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,439
if you're here this morning

375
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,519
and you were able to sing out that song,

376
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,759
Saved, Saved, and you know that you are heaven bound,

377
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,719
not because of anything you've done,

378
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,959
but because Christ saved you.

379
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,679
Remember what Paul said.

380
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,599
He said, this is a worthy, a faithful saying

381
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,159
and worthy of all acceptation

382
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:50,079
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

383
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,179
He continues and says, of whom I am chief.

384
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,279
See, Paul knew personally the power of the gospel

385
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,039
because God saved him.

386
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:04,159
He remembered regularly and he rehearsed regularly

387
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,359
that account on the road to Damascus

388
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,759
as we would read of it in Acts chapter nine.

389
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,719
Paul was regularly aware of and rehearsed

390
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,239
of the moment, the day that he got saved

391
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,439
by the grace of God,

392
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:20,239
and then he goes out and he preaches the gospel.

393
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:24,039
Everywhere he goes, he's preaching the gospel, why?

394
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,359
Because he's confident that the gospel works.

395
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,879
He's confident that the gospel

396
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,959
is the power of God unto salvation.

397
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:35,959
He is confident that Jesus is able to save.

398
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,919
He's confident that God loves

399
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,479
and God is not willing that any should perish.

400
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,440
Every person that you come in contact with,

401
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,239
every person that I come in contact with is a soul.

402
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,119
They're gonna live forever,

403
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,559
either in heaven with our Savior

404
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,599
or they're gonna be tormented forever in the lake of fire.

405
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,959
That's just the reality of scripture.

406
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,719
That's the truth of God's word.

407
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,880
And there's only one way to get to heaven.

408
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,759
And that way is Jesus Christ.

409
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,559
There are many, religion will tell you

410
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,279
and many different people will tell you,

411
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,000
oh, just be sincere, all roads lead to,

412
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,959
and just do your best.

413
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,599
And I can tell you on the authority of God's word,

414
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,479
that's not biblical.

415
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,039
That's not what God said.

416
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,479
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

417
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,839
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

418
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,320
Can I tell you this morning, it's not your works.

419
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,719
You can't work your way to heaven.

420
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,639
Not by works of righteousness, which we have done.

421
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,039
All of our works according to Isaiah is filthy rags.

422
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,639
God said that all have sinned

423
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,839
and come short of the glory of God.

424
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,759
We're all sinners.

425
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,119
But we as, we would look at these four men

426
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,719
and their concern for their friends.

427
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:04,419
And as we would try to make application this morning, just as they were concerned, but

428
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:10,019
then just as they had confidence, we must have confidence in the message that God has

429
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,219
entrusted us to deliver.

430
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,379
That message is powerful.

431
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,539
Listen, that message changed my life.

432
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,559
And for many of you this morning, you could stand and testify, that message changed my

433
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,899
life.

434
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,779
The gospel is powerful.

435
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,499
And this morning, just as we look at the actions of these men and we note their confidence,

436
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,499
why?

437
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,419
Because they said, we just need to get them to Jesus.

438
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:42,739
Because if we could get them to Jesus, then Jesus can do something about his condition.

439
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:49,139
We find not only the concern and the confidence, but notice with me number three this morning,

440
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:55,259
I want you to note their cooperation and their determination, but we note their cooperation

441
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,499
and determination as it's revealed here to us in the portion of scripture.

442
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:02,559
First of all, I want you to see that this was no easy task.

443
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,219
In verse number three, the Bible tells us this man is sick of the palsy and these four

444
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:10,059
men are going to bring him to Jesus.

445
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,899
Now we do not know the distance by which they had to travel to bring him to the house where

446
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:20,779
Jesus was, but we find that if you're trying to transport someone in the heat of the day,

447
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,739
we were in Capernaum and we stood on the side of the Sea of Galilee several years ago

448
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:30,059
as we were standing there listening to a message being delivered.

449
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,459
And I'm telling you, we just stood there.

450
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,559
We weren't doing any kind of work.

451
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,259
And it was October, the end of October, supposed to be the cooler time of year, and we were

452
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,259
burning up.

453
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,459
It was hot.

454
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,059
It took them some hard work.

455
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,699
You ever try to carry dead weight?

456
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,479
It's labor.

457
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:53,279
But they were concerned and they were confident, and so therefore there was this cooperation

458
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,479
and this determination, this man that would be born of four.

459
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:01,479
There was no way that one man would be able to bring him on his own and the difficulties

460
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:07,279
that would present themselves with this task of bringing this man to Jesus.

461
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,619
And so there was this cooperation.

462
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:17,759
We find that as they get there, there is revealed to us their determination because of the inability

463
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:22,919
for them to get into the home where Jesus was.

464
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,679
See, they faced obstacles.

465
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,319
You know, as we try to give the gospel to people, we too will face obstacles.

466
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,559
There will be those that would stand in the way.

467
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,999
There will be some that say, hey, you can't talk about that here.

468
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:39,999
Hey, that's not allowed.

469
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:44,559
That's…whatever they will say, the obstacles will present themselves.

470
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,039
But we find that these individuals, though they arrive there and there's no way for

471
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,239
them to get in, and verse number four says, when they could not come nigh unto him, meaning

472
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:57,599
Jesus for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was.

473
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,759
When they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

474
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,999
Can you imagine, maybe in your mind's eye this morning, you can get the picture of these

475
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:07,999
men.

476
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:12,839
Can you imagine them getting this man up onto the roof to begin with?

477
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:19,279
The difficulty, the way in which they would have to work together, that cooperation that

478
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,999
these four men, as they would bring this one sick of the palsy up onto the roof, and as

479
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,399
they would then begin to break up the roof so that they could let him down again, there's

480
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,359
a great need for cooperation.

481
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,799
I mean, if you just let down your side before they let down his side, it's a real problem

482
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,679
with the arrival of this man.

483
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,479
And there's cooperation, but there's determination.

484
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:45,479
They were not going to stop.

485
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:49,399
We don't read the text of Scripture that they arrived to the home and there was a great

486
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,439
crowd and so they went home.

487
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,799
There was an obstacle so they gave up.

488
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,799
No.

489
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:02,999
They said, there's got to be a way that we can get this, our friend, to Jesus.

490
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:10,959
Because we know, we are confident that Jesus can do something about his condition.

491
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:15,799
As we think about this thought of cooperation, I want you to hold your place here in Mark

492
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,239
and turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

493
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:25,399
In 1 Corinthians chapter number 3, it's a passage of Scripture that we've often referenced

494
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:32,719
with regard to the work that God has called us to do, but I want to remind you as we look

495
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:38,919
here in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3, begin looking in verse number 4.

496
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,879
There was some division there in Corinth and it's summarized in verse number 4, for while

497
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:50,319
one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are you not carnal?

498
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,759
But then I want you to notice the truth by which we get to in verse number 5.

499
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,519
The Bible says, who then is Paul and who is Apollos?

500
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,839
You notice these words, but ministers.

501
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:09,719
But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.

502
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:13,319
Notice what Paul says, I have planted.

503
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,399
If you think about the Apostle Paul, and we're going to actually preach this evening on a

504
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:21,039
preach from Acts chapter 18, when you look at Paul arriving into Corinth, and we're going

505
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,839
to look at that portion of Scripture, but Paul says, I have planted.

506
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,239
You see, God used the Apostle Paul to enter into the city of Corinth to preach the gospel,

507
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:36,039
to see a church established there, and he goes in and he plants, and he says, I have

508
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:44,719
planted, Apollos watered, but God, God gave the increase.

509
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:51,759
So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth

510
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,959
the increase.

511
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,999
Now, he that planteth and he that watereth, notice what it says, are one.

512
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,639
They are one.

513
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:03,319
And every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.

514
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:11,159
And then notice this phrase in verse number 9, for we are laborers together with God.

515
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,439
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

516
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:19,759
What a blessing to understand that we are laborers together with God.

517
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:26,159
It is some plant and some water that we recognize that it's God that gives the increase, but

518
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,119
there must be this understanding that he that planteth and he that watereth are one.

519
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:37,799
There's a cooperation as we're seeking to take the truth of the gospel to a lost and

520
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,839
dying world, understanding their condition, understanding that they're hopeless and they're

521
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:51,799
helpless and understanding that I too and you as well were one day in that same position.

522
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:57,239
I don't know if you can remember when you were lost, but I can.

523
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:01,439
I can remember what it was to have no peace.

524
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:05,679
I can remember what it was to have fear of dying.

525
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,639
And especially after I had been confronted with the gospel at the age of almost 13, between

526
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:17,319
that age and 17, not being saved, but being confronted with the truth of the gospel for

527
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,799
those long four years.

528
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,039
The knowledge that if I were to die without Christ, I'd spend eternity in the lake of

529
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,039
fire.

530
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,239
Those are some long, hard years.

531
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,239
Why didn't you just get saved?

532
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,239
I don't know.

533
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,239
I was hard-headed.

534
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:42,159
When I was 17, I finally waved that flag of surrender, said, Lord, I need a savior.

535
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:43,679
I know that you're the only savior.

536
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,679
I'm a sinner.

537
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,039
It was no hard thing for me to acknowledge that I was a sinner in the need of the only

538
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,039
savior.

539
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,279
And I bowed my head and my heart and I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior.

540
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,879
And from that day until this day, I've not had those fears.

541
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,239
I've not had that uncertainty.

542
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,639
Why?

543
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,799
Because he gave me new life.

544
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,159
He saved my soul.

545
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,999
He changed my life.

546
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:11,079
And we've experienced that.

547
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,279
And I understand that there were some people that were cooperating in bringing the gospel

548
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,279
to me.

549
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,839
And then now, as we have the opportunity to be laborers together with God, that we're

550
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,519
cooperating one with another and that God gives that opportunity to us.

551
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,919
Ultimately, it's all for God's glory.

552
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,879
It's not so that the one that plants gets any recognition or even that the one that

553
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:36,879
waters.

554
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:39,159
But it's God that gave the increase.

555
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:45,159
It's God that receives the glory that is due unto his name.

556
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:51,539
We find, as we look at this portion of Scripture in just the first four verses, five verses,

557
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:57,599
we find here their concern, their confidence, their cooperation.

558
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,959
In verse 5, we find that the Bible says, when Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick

559
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:09,639
of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

560
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,039
Beginning in verse 5 and through the end of our text this morning in verse number 12,

561
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,239
we note number 4, the compassion of Christ.

562
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,679
I'm so thankful that our God is compassionate.

563
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,679
He's gracious.

564
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,879
He's merciful.

565
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:26,919
I'm so thankful, as we look at this portion of Scripture, that though Jesus, in the midst

566
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,319
of his teaching, in the midst of the preaching, and this interruption that takes place, I

567
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,239
mean, can you imagine the crowd as they're gathered together?

568
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,079
I mean, there are religious leaders here.

569
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,679
We know the scribes are there, and any time they showed up to one of Christ's messages,

570
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,839
they were there to find fault with them.

571
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,919
They weren't there to learn.

572
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,399
They weren't there to gain.

573
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,399
No, no, no.

574
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,779
They were there to find fault, to criticize, to cause others to doubt, and that was their

575
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,799
reason for being there.

576
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,799
And we find, again, as they're gathered together in this likely a small place.

577
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,819
a small home. There's so many people that are there, and then all of a sudden they

578
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:09,099
hear the noise on the roof, and the tiles move over, and a guy is dropped

579
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:15,239
by ropes. These four men are bringing this man down into the presence of Jesus.

580
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:20,419
Can you imagine the crowd? Can you imagine as they're observing,

581
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:29,059
they're experiencing this interruption, and Jesus says that He saw their faith.

582
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,419
They believed that God was able, and the Bible says that He looked at that man

583
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:41,779
and said, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. That's pretty amazing as you look at

584
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:46,739
this portion of Scripture, and you think of all that's taking place, and how that

585
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:54,699
Jesus focuses His attention upon this man. The four are, best as I can tell

586
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:58,859
from the text of Scripture, they're still up on the roof, and this man is now there

587
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,739
in the presence of Jesus, and Jesus sees and understands what's taking place, and

588
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,979
He speaks to this individual. I want you to understand this morning that in the

589
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:13,259
midst of all the people, in the midst of a crowd, Jesus is concerned about the

590
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:19,899
individual, and I love that truth. We find so often throughout the Gospel

591
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:28,499
records that Jesus, though He's thronged with people, though there's so many, so

592
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:34,219
often the Scriptures deal with the individual. I said it earlier, God loves

593
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:41,219
the entire world, but I'm so thankful that He loves us individually. See, God

594
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:46,979
loves you this morning. God loves every person that you come into contact with.

595
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:53,179
You say, well, they're not very lovable. Neither were you. Amen. But He loves. And

596
00:31:53,179 --> 00:32:00,179
we find that the greatest need of this man, though the friends were concerned

597
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,859
about his condition, his physical condition, the greatest need of this man was not

598
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:12,899
his mobility. The greatest need of this man is the same need that is shared by

599
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,299
every human being, and that is forgiveness from sin. It's the greatest need of every

600
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:28,299
human being. We find this morning that only God can forgive sins. We look at the

601
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:33,379
text of Scripture, and we find, as we've read earlier, that there were the scribes

602
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:39,379
sitting there in verse number six, and we find that in verse number seven is their

603
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:44,219
reasoning in their hearts, and their concern about the statement that Jesus makes with

604
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:49,179
regard to the forgiveness of his sins, and they reason, and they say, who can forgive

605
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:56,099
sins but God only? So they had an understanding of proper biblical truth. You know, I can't

606
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,219
forgive your sins, and you can't forgive my sins. There is nothing I can do to forgive

607
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:06,539
your sins. Now I can forgive you as a person, and were commanded to do so in Ephesians 4.32,

608
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,979
but as far as your sin and the consequences, I can't forgive you. Only God can forgive

609
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:18,819
you. These individuals, as I mentioned earlier, they did not understand that Jesus was God.

610
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:25,579
They continued to resist that obvious truth throughout the life and ministry of the Lord

611
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:32,579
Jesus Christ. So Jesus, he says to these scoffers, to these scribes, he says, whether

612
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,299
is it easier in verse number nine to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven

613
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:45,299
thee, or to say, Arise and take up thy bed and walk? Which is easier? See, Jesus is dealing

614
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:52,139
with the heart of the matter, with the most significant need of humankind, and that being

615
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:58,539
the sin condition of mankind. If Jesus had simply said, Take up thy bed and walk, and

616
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:03,139
the man rose up and he walked, there'd be no interaction, there'd be no conversation

617
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:09,859
with regard to sin. But we find that Jesus says in verse number 10, But that ye may know

618
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:16,259
that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins. He then says to the man, Arise

619
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:22,500
in verse number 11, Take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house. I'm so thankful

620
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,859
this morning to be forgiven. You know, it's a wonderful thing, a wonderful truth to be

621
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:34,299
forgiven. There's a song, Julianna sang it years ago, Forgiven Forever. There's only

622
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:39,379
one way to be forgiven. We're talking about sin. We're talking about the context here

623
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:45,819
this morning of the sin of mankind. The only way to be forgiven, and we understand that

624
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:50,779
God offers, freely offers forgiveness to mankind, it's only through the Lord Jesus

625
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:58,459
Christ, through the precious blood that was shed on the cross of Calvary. And this morning,

626
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:03,979
when we know in this text of Scripture the compassion of Christ, and we understand that

627
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:10,099
our God is gracious and He's loving and He's forgiving, we must rejoice in that truth.

628
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:17,459
The Bible says in the book of Psalms that with thee there is forgiveness. What a joy

629
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:26,059
to understand the means by which humankind can be forgiven. See, we were guilty. The

630
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:32,139
world is guilty. We need forgiveness. It only comes through Jesus Christ. Notice these verses

631
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:36,459
with me. Ephesians chapter 1, if you will. We'll look at a few verses in the book of

632
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:41,299
Ephesians, Colossians, and then we'll make our way back to the book of Acts and be done

633
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:59,299
this morning. But look at Ephesians chapter 1. Ephesians chapter 1. In Ephesians 1, we

634
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:04,539
find that the apostle Paul, writing to these believers in Ephesus, he calls them saints

635
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:09,179
in verse number 1. The missionary journey had taken place. The gospel got to Ephesus

636
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:14,379
and souls were saved. The church was established. And he speaks to them about their standing

637
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:19,859
in Christ, their position in Christ. Really, we see that throughout the first, second,

638
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,379
and third chapter. But notice with me in verse number 6, he says, to the praise of the glory

639
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:30,839
of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the beloved. Notice, in whom we have redemption

640
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:37,919
through His blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace. What

641
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:43,159
of this morning? Do you know that you're forgiven? Do you know that your sins have been forgiven?

642
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:49,319
You say, well, I'm working on that. You can't work on it. I'm trying to pay for them. You

643
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:55,199
can't pay for them. It's already been paid for with the precious blood of Christ. You

644
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,959
know what a sad thing. There are people sincerely, and I'm not being unkind, but there are people

645
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:08,679
that sincerely, this morning, have been deceived thinking that they can somehow pay for their

646
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:17,279
own sins. That they can do some work, some action to pay for their sins, while Jesus

647
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:25,039
says it's already been paid for. If righteousness came by the law, Paul says in the book of

648
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:31,959
Galatians, then Christ is dead in vain. Can I tell you this morning that Christ did not

649
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:38,519
die in vain? He did not die in vain. He died on that cruel cross and He shed His precious

650
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:48,519
blood because there was no other way for mankind to be forgiven. And He offered Himself willingly,

651
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,519
once and for all, according to the book of Hebrews. I'm so thankful for that once and

652
00:37:54,519 --> 00:38:05,759
for all. Jesus said, it is finished. Paul says to these believers in Ephesus that they've

653
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:11,639
been forgiven. Notice in chapter 2, beginning in verse number 1, he says,

654
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,839
And you hath He quickened to be made alive, to be born again. See, because we were dead

655
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,519
in trespasses and sins. I mean, we were alive physically, we're dead spiritually.

656
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:29,039
It says in verse number 2, wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world,

657
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,359
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of

658
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,839
disobedience. Notice this in verse number 3, among whom also we all had our conversation in times

659
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,679
past, and the lust of our flesh. Listen, if you're here this morning and you're saved, we sang the

660
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:49,479
song, Only a Sinner, Saved by Grace. If you're saved this morning, I'm thankful that I'm a child

661
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:54,959
of God. I'm a joint heir with Christ. I am a saint, according to the scriptures. I am His child,

662
00:38:54,959 --> 00:39:02,880
hallelujah. But we all were in the same boat. We're all sinners in need of a Savior. And Paul

663
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,919
explains that clearly in verse number 3. We all had the same condition. Notice as we continue in

664
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:13,679
verse number 3, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the

665
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:23,839
children of wrath, even as others. You were born that way. Why? Because sin comes through Adam.

666
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:32,440
It's passed on. We have a sin nature. He says this in verse 4, I love the first two words,

667
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:40,119
but God. But God. Changes the whole course of this passage of scripture. But God,

668
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:51,640
who is rich in mercy. Notice, for His great love, wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in

669
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:59,159
sins, hath quickened us together with Christ by grace, your saint, and hath raised us up together

670
00:39:59,159 --> 00:39:59,640
and

671
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,400
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

672
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
that in the ages to come He might show

673
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,620
the exceeding riches of His grace and His kindness

674
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,280
toward us through Christ Jesus,

675
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,080
for by grace are you saved through faith.

676
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,960
Notice, and that not of yourselves,

677
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,420
it is the gift of God, not of works,

678
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,220
lest any man should boast.

679
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,060
Verse 10, for we are His workmanship

680
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,160
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

681
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,400
which God hath before ordained

682
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,140
that we should walk in them.

683
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,600
It's a gift.

684
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,940
If you could earn it, if you could work for it,

685
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,820
it's not a gift, and you would have reason to boast.

686
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,680
You know what you could say?

687
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
I made it.

688
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,180
I made it to heaven.

689
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,420
I was good enough.

690
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,880
But God says none of us are good enough.

691
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,220
No one that you interact with is good enough.

692
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,300
They need to understand the gospel,

693
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,640
the death, burn, and resurrection,

694
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,140
and the fact that not by works,

695
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,680
as we see here, lest any man should boast.

696
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,980
Now, verse 10 deals with we are His workmanship

697
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,020
in Christ Jesus.

698
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,380
Now, we understand that after we're saved,

699
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,560
those works that we would do, those good works,

700
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
they're not for salvation.

701
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,420
They're not to earn it, and they're not to keep it.

702
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,260
You know why?

703
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm kept by the power of God.

704
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,660
He gave me eternal life.

705
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,100
He said that the gift that He gave me,

706
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,040
that it would never perish, that I would never perish,

707
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,940
because He said, I give unto them eternal life,

708
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,040
and they shall never perish in John 10 in verse 27.

709
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,780
Peter says that we're kept by the power of God,

710
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,340
that we have an inheritance

711
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,740
that's reserved in heaven for us.

712
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,380
It's no corruption.

713
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,340
It's not defiled.

714
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,980
I mean, it's reserved for us.

715
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,380
He didn't say that I give you probationary life.

716
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,260
He didn't say I give you temporary life.

717
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,860
He said, I give you eternal life.

718
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,960
And this is the message

719
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,320
that God has entrusted us to give to people,

720
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,720
that we understand their condition,

721
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,460
and it draws to us in some capacity

722
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,500
this measure of concern for those that we interact with,

723
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,460
that they're going to die one day,

724
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,300
and if they die without Christ,

725
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,540
they will spend eternity in the lake of fire.

726
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,380
It ought to concern us.

727
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,540
It ought to give us some care,

728
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,180
because we have confidence that Jesus saves.

729
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,880
Jesus saves.

730
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,240
Jesus saves.

731
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,980
We have confidence in the power of the gospel.

732
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,080
We cooperate one with another to bring people to Jesus.

733
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,560
Why?

734
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,060
Because Jesus is compassionate.

735
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,560
Because Jesus cares.

736
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,100
Because Jesus loves.

737
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,880
Because Jesus forgives.

738
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,680
We find that here in this passage of scripture,

739
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,680
we are rejoicing in our newfound position in Christ,

740
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,540
that we're saved by the grace of God,

741
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,060
that we're his children,

742
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,140
and he's given us this task of being his representatives.

743
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,740
Look over the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter 13.

744
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,940
In Acts chapter number 13,

745
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,300
we find it's really the record

746
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,060
of the first missionary journey,

747
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,020
as God would separate Paul and Barnabas.

748
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,860
In fact, it's early on in this chapter

749
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,860
where his name is changed to Paul from Saul.

750
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,420
We find that they're going throughout the region of Galatia.

751
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,800
They're going from city to city and preaching,

752
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,440
and they're dealing with much opposition, by the way.

753
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,200
In every place where they find themselves,

754
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,320
there's opposition.

755
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,340
In fact, there are times in which

756
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,080
the opposition is exceeding great.

757
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,420
They're chased out of city.

758
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,240
We find that at the end of chapter number 14

759
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,840
that Paul, on that same missionary journey,

760
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,960
that he's stoned and left for dead.

761
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,040
We find here in the midst of Acts chapter 13,

762
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,440
I want you to find and look at verse 37 with me

763
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,600
as Paul is preaching here.

764
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,960
This is in verse 37,

765
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,840
but he whom God raised again saw no corruption.

766
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,200
He's speaking of Jesus.

767
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,120
And notice where he says,

768
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,200
"'Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren,

769
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,000
"'that through this man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

770
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,180
"'God in flesh, is preached unto you

771
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,300
"'the forgiveness of sins.'"

772
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,000
That's the message that we preach,

773
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,780
is a message of forgiveness, a message of hope,

774
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,600
a glorious message.

775
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,640
The gospel literally is the good news.

776
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,700
And if we're not careful this morning,

777
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,780
we can get so busy, we can get so distracted,

778
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,380
that we go through life almost like we have blinders on,

779
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,660
and we don't see the opportunities

780
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,100
that God would give us.

781
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,340
So we need to have concern.

782
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,060
One of this morning, how concerned are you

783
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,940
for your neighbors, the ones that annoy you?

784
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,500
How concerned are you for them?

785
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,220
Your coworkers, the one that doesn't pull their weight

786
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,300
in the office.

787
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,500
You understand what I'm saying to you this morning.

788
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,380
Their soul, they need Jesus.

789
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,620
We have friends and family members,

790
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,380
people that we randomly come into contact with.

791
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,300
We have concern for them.

792
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,600
I'll close with this true testimony.

793
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,580
Many of you would know,

794
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,300
there's a man that came to church here

795
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,640
for a number of years, sporadically,

796
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,300
on a Sunday evening, really only.

797
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,060
His name was Chris.

798
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,580
And Chris would come, and Chris would fight,

799
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,300
and he'd argue, and he'd debate.

800
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,860
He'd say ugly things.

801
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,420
I mean, just carry on.

802
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,740
Some of you had conversation with him, and you know.

803
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,580
He'd have conversation with my wife,

804
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,520
and he'd say some ugly things to her.

805
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,340
And he'd say to her something like this,

806
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,080
he'd say, stop praying for me.

807
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,640
Because my wife would say, I'm praying for you.

808
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,000
You know, he'd say, stop praying for him

809
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,680
because it was convicting him,

810
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,920
because he was lost.

811
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,600
And I'll never forget, Chris looked at me one night,

812
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,720
with all sincerity, and he said this,

813
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,080
why do you care?

814
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,880
Why do you care?

815
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,440
And he followed that statement up with this one.

816
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,000
I don't care if I die and go to hell.

817
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,120
So why do you care?

818
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,980
Now that's a, whew, that's a crazy statement.

819
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,280
But that's what he said to me.

820
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,180
You know, for a number of years, really,

821
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,760
we just tried to show love and compassion and care.

822
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,740
He'd show up three or four Sunday nights in a row,

823
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,920
and then you wouldn't see him for months.

824
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,040
Many of you know.

825
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,360
There was a Saturday afternoon

826
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,120
that Chris showed up here to church.

827
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,480
He just kind of sat out on the front porch.

828
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,120
I wasn't in my office, and I wasn't aware of him being here,

829
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,080
and then after a little while, I saw that he was here,

830
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,400
I think actually one of my kids said,

831
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,720
hey, somebody's up at the church,

832
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,560
and came walking over here, and it was Chris.

833
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,360
And we walked about 20 feet into the fellowship hall

834
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,880
at the first table, and he got on his knees

835
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,280
in that fellowship hall, and he prayed

836
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,720
and asked Christ to save him.

837
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,080
But he said, why do you care?

838
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,360
You know why we care?

839
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,060
Because we understand the truth of the Bible.

840
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,120
And here's what I told Chris.

841
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,360
I said, Chris, I randomly, regularly knock on people's door

842
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,960
that I don't even know to try to share with them

843
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,160
the truth of the gospel.

844
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,359
You've come to our church, and guess what?

845
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,359
It's because Brother, Miss Sundeen, what's his name?

846
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,320
Smallwood, Brother Smallwood worked with Chris

847
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,799
and said, you need to go to church,

848
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,280
you need to go to Fellowship Baptist Church.

849
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,679
Brother Smallwood wasn't even a member of this church,

850
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,000
but he said, you need to go to Fellowship Baptist Church,

851
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,840
and he showed up, and years later, he got saved.

852
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,480
Listen, there are people that just need somebody to care,

853
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,420
to have concern.

854
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,200
See, are you confident this morning

855
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,940
in the truth of the gospel?

856
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,520
I mean, I'm confident that Jesus will save.

857
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,480
He'll save anyone, because he is the Savior of the world.

858
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,840
If someone comes humbly, acknowledging that they're a sinner

859
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,880
in need of the Savior, and they bow their head and heart

860
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,200
and confess and forsake, and they believe Christ,

861
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,239
and he said that he'd say, for whosoever shall call

862
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,000
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

863
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,059
What a joy to be able to deliver this glorious message.

864
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm concerned sometimes that we can just get too busy

865
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,480
in life, we can get too distracted.

866
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,720
By the way, that's exactly what the enemy wants us to do,

867
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,440
is be distracted and be busy, and not be about the work

868
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,840
that God has given us to do.

869
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:06,760
to. We are His representatives. We are His ambassadors. This morning, we need to be bringing

870
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,960
people to Jesus. Just as these four men, unnamed. Why are they unnamed? Because it doesn't matter

871
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,560
who they are. They just brought somebody to Jesus. We don't even know His name. But we

872
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,640
know Jesus and we know that He receives the glory. And those scribes and all those there,

873
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,960
they said, we have never seen it like this before. And they glorified God. That's what

874
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,800
it's all about. That's what it's all about. This morning, bringing people to Jesus. Let's

875
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,280
pray. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

876
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:45,700
the privilege of being your representatives, your ambassadors. And God, I pray this morning

877
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,840
as we look at this portion of Scripture and we understand contextually and historically

878
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,840
the event that took place. God, as we've taken opportunity to make application in our own

879
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,840
lives with regard to the spiritual condition of those that we come in contact with on

880
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:12,040
a daily basis. God, I pray that you'd help us to be used of thee to bring people to Jesus,

881
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,640
to bring them to you, Lord. I pray that you would have your will and way in the midst

882
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:24,000
of this time of invitation. Lord, if there's someone here, someone that's tuned in via

883
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,840
live stream that's not sure of heaven, they were thinking that they might go to heaven.

884
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:35,520
They're hoping that they'd go to heaven. They're trying to do their best that they could go

885
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:45,200
to heaven. God, I pray today that you would convince them of the truth of your Word, that

886
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,760
Jesus is the only Savior. They cannot work their way. They cannot be good enough. God,

887
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,520
I pray that you'd work to that end. For those of us that are saved, oh God, would you help

888
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:05,280
us to be yielded and surrendered, to be your servants, to have that care and concern, to

889
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:12,520
have that confidence to cooperate one with another so that we might see souls saved and

890
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,560
lives changed. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do in the time of invitation.

891
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,080
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
