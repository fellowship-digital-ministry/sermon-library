WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.319
And I'm actually gonna preach a couple of messages today,

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:04.440
both this morning and this evening

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.000
in preparation for our annual missions conference.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
And as you know, as I mentioned

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.520
by way of announcements this morning,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.239
that our missions conference begins

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.879
on Saturday of this week.

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:18.319
And we're excited about it.

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:20.120
Over the five days of our conference,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.840
we will have a purposed focus on the responsibility

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.399
that God has given to his people

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.780
to reach the world with the gospel.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.379
There are many who have never heard

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.819
the name of Jesus Christ.

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.979
They do not know that their sins can be forgiven.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.180
They do not know the power of the gospel.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.819
And we have a responsibility biblically

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.220
to take the gospel to every creature.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.500
We have a responsibility here in our local Jerusalem,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.860
in our local area to reach our community

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
to be the light that God has given us to be here.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.639
We seek to regularly go out with purpose

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.340
to reach people.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.319
We have gospel tracks that we encourage you to take

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.279
on a weekly basis as you leave here

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.599
and try to engage people with the gospel

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.239
and the personal contacts that you will have.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.919
We have organized visitation and outreach

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:15.040
for the purpose of strategically

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.160
and systematically reaching our Jerusalem

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.680
with the gospel.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.620
And so we are thankful for the opportunities

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.239
that God has given us.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.879
But we understand that we think about world missions,

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.199
that we have a responsibility to reach the entire world.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.339
And we do that through supporting missionaries.

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:36.900
Of course, we have our missions map on the wall.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.800
We give you regularly updates from our missionaries

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.160
so that you can stay informed

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.879
and understand how you can pray for them

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.400
and with them about the ministry

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.120
that God has called them to.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.720
And then we have the opportunity, of course,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.720
to give to missions so that we can invest personally

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.559
in these missionaries being able to go

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.040
and take the gospel to the field

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.519
that God has called them to.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:04.440
This particular missions conference,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.760
we'll have a missionary that's going

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.879
to the country of Spain.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.880
We already have one missionary in the country of Spain,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.399
but there's a need for more than just one missionary

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.520
in that country.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.320
Of course, there are many missionaries there

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.199
that I know of.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.839
And so we're looking forward to having this missionary

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:19.679
join us.

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:20.880
And we have another missionary going to the country

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.720
of the Netherlands.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.699
We do not actively currently have any missionaries

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.440
that we support in the Netherlands.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800
And so we're excited about having another region,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.479
another area where we possibly can partner together

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.360
and have the opportunity to see what God will do there

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240
in that part of the world.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.759
Over the past couple of Sunday evenings,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.259
I've shared some things that God has laid on my heart.

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.520
If you've been here the last two weeks

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.720
with regard to being spiritually prepared

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.919
for this special meeting, this missions conference,

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.119
from the life of Moses in Exodus chapter number three,

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.160
two weeks ago, we learned this valuable truth

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.160
that God has a plan and God's plan includes his people.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.399
And I'm so thankful that our God loves the entire world.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.639
I'm thankful that he loves me.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.080
His love is a global yet individual love.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.520
He loves us as individuals, but he loves the entire world.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.320
And we find that God has a plan.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.960
He's given us in his word, the plan to reach the world,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.039
but he uses his people.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.639
When we looked at the life of Moses

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:24.880
in Exodus chapter number three,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.919
God had a plan to deliver his people from Egypt,

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.880
but he was gonna use Moses to facilitate

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.199
the work that God would do.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.199
Last week on Sunday evening from the life of Gideon,

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.720
we learned that every one of us has a place

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.360
and the importance of being in our place.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360
Every man in his place was the title last week.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.740
And we had the opportunity to look at that portion

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.300
of scripture and to see the obedience and the submission,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.139
the courage and the obedience that those men displayed,

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.679
those 300 men of Gideon's army.

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.580
This morning as we travel to the book of Mark

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.059
in the second chapter, we really take a journey

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.440
to Capernaum and we learn a valuable lesson

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.059
or really valuable lessons from this miraculous event

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.220
that is recorded in Mark chapter number two.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.660
Now, many of us are familiar with this portion

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.919
of scripture, but let me read it to you.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.519
We'll dig into the message this morning.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.700
The Bible says in verse number one,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.540
and again, he, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.179
entered into Capernaum after some days.

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:26.459
Notice verse number one continues and says,

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:31.040
and it was noised that he, Christ, was in the house.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.380
And straightway many were gathered together

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.140
in so much that there was no room to receive them.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.260
No, not so much as about the door.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.980
And he, Christ, preached the word unto them.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.140
What a message it must have been.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.660
And to think about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.100
teaching and preaching here in Capernaum at this house.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500
And the Bible says in verse number three,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.980
and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.779
which was born of four.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.160
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.059
they uncovered the roof where he was.

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.899
And when they had broken it up,

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:14.019
they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:15.820
When Jesus saw their faith,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.299
he said unto the sick of the palsy,

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:22.019
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:23.940
But there were certain of the scribes sitting there

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.820
and reasoning in their hearts.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.100
And here's what they say.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.940
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.279
Who can forgive sins but God only?

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.220
You know, they were right that only God can forgive sin.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.220
Every single human being has a sin problem.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.859
It's a universal condition.

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:43.459
Outside of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.619
every other human being was born with a sin nature.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.380
And they say this, who can forgive sins but God only?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.260
What they did not understand

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and the truth that they resisted, that Jesus is God.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.980
And we find that in verse number eight,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.059
the Bible says immediately when Jesus perceived

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.700
in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.820
he said unto them,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.660
why reason ye these things in your hearts?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.500
Now that must have been pretty confronting

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.299
and conflicting for them to know that Jesus is there.

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:17.420
They've not verbalized their thoughts

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.380
and Jesus says, why are you thinking this?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.140
He knows our thoughts, he knows your thoughts.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.500
The Bible says that Jesus continues

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.899
and it says to him in verse number nine

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.540
or to this group of these religious leaders,

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.500
he says, whether is it easier to say

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.459
to the sick of the palsy, thy sins be forgiven thee

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.459
or to say, arise and take up thy bed and walk.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.380
But that ye may know that the son of man

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.579
hath power on earth to forgive sins.

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:51.859
So he's speaking to the religious leaders

00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:55.420
and then he turns at the end of verse number 10

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.100
to the one that was sick of the palsy,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.459
the one that was born of four,

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:01.459
he turns to him as it says at the end of verse number 10,

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.859
he saith to the sick of the palsy,

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:08.540
I say unto thee, arise, take up thy bed

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.260
and go thy way into thine house.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.500
And notice verse 12, it says immediately he arose,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.220
took up the bed and went forth before them all

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.459
in so much that they were all amazed and glorified God.

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.140
Notice what they said, we never saw it on this fashion.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.459
It's a great passage of scripture in Mark chapter number two

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:30.940
I've titled the message this morning,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.859
bringing people to Jesus, bringing people to Jesus.

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:37.559
I think that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.459
I note four specific things that I wanna draw

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.059
your attention to this morning.

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:45.179
Number one, note their concern.

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:47.540
Note their concern, when I speak about their concern,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.899
I'm speaking about these four friends

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.640
of this man that was sick of the palsy.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.500
We find that these four men are unnamed,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.260
we do not have in the text of scripture before us

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.220
nor in any other gospel record,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.380
the names of these four individuals.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.820
But we find that these four individuals,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.059
though we do not know much about them,

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:10.619
we know from this portion of scripture

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.640
that they had concern for this friend

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.179
that was sick of the palsy.

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:19.420
We find that this information that God reveals to us

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.380
about these four men is powerful truth.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.140
It's important that we recognize the concern that they have,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.420
but we find that as this friend of theirs

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.460
is in this grave condition, that they had this concern,

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.640
they had care and compassion for this individual.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.919
We find that as we look at this portion,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.599
the Bible tells us in verse number three,

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:42.799
and when they come unto him,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.799
bringing one sick of the palsy, which was born of four.

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:49.960
We understand from verse number three,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.960
the care, the compassion, the concern

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.659
that these friends have for this man

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:57.200
that's sick of the palsy.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.479
And we begin to understand that this man,

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:05.440
he had no ability in of himself to come to Jesus.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.039
He had no ability to come to the place,

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:11.200
to the house where Jesus was,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.559
where Jesus was preaching and teaching.

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:18.559
He was dependent on someone else bringing him to Jesus.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.440
And I begin to think about the concern

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.239
that these men had for their friend

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:28.840
and this concern, of course, leading them to action.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.359
And we this morning must consider

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:34.280
the condition of those around us.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.400
I'm not speaking this morning of a physical condition.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.400
And even in the text of scripture,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.840
we see that God deals with both the physical,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.640
but more importantly, the spiritual.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.200
Not everyone that we come in contact with

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.520
has a physical condition,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.719
like the man described in Mark chapter number two.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.039
Not everyone that we come into contact with

00:09:55.039 --> 00:10:00.039
has some type of inability to move into one.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.839
walk as this man has, but we find that every human being

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:08.279
that we come into contact with has a sin condition.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.619
And we find that Jesus, not only does he heal the man

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:15.079
physically, but he deals with the sin,

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.639
the greatest need of this individual,

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.239
and we'll deal with that at the end of the message

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:21.439
this morning, but I want you to understand

00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:24.159
that when we live life, when we go through life,

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:27.999
when we interact with people, I wonder this morning,

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.419
how concerned are we for their souls?

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:36.519
I wonder this morning how our actions reveal our concern.

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:43.739
Because true concern will lead to action.

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.619
There was a song that I believe last year

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:52.879
during our missions conference, I think it was Brianna

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.479
maybe and Holly sang the song,

00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:57.919
and it's entitled Someone Cared.

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:59.799
And I just want to read the words to you

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:03.679
as we think about this concern of these four men.

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:06.519
The songwriter of this particular song says,

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:10.479
I was lost without hope, a hope of being found.

00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:13.519
To sin I was a servant, I was bound.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.999
Life was going nowhere, no matter what I tried.

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:20.779
I searched for peace, but nothing satisfied.

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:24.359
Then someone cared.

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:28.599
Someone cared enough to bring the truth to me.

00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:31.759
Someone cared and now my soul is free.

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:35.819
I know it wasn't easy to be bold enough to share,

00:11:35.819 --> 00:11:38.899
but I'm so glad someone cared.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:44.399
Others too are searching for salvation full and free.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.719
Listen, I know that there are times

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:47.259
that we get lots of rejections.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:50.039
People say I'm not interested, I don't want that,

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:52.039
no thank you, so on and so forth.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:56.999
But there are people that are hurting.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:00.799
There are people that are in despair.

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:04.319
And they need the hope of the gospel, the truth,

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:06.399
and here the songwriter says others too

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.499
are searching for salvation full and free.

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:11.999
Won't somebody tell them of the Christ of Calvary?

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:16.999
The debt is paid already, but the message must be shared.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:19.599
Jesus paid it all.

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.439
He said it is finished.

00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:25.279
But there are people that have never heard the gospel.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.559
They don't know, they need to hear.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:30.199
Does anybody care, the songwriter says,

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:32.519
and then the chorus, someone cared enough

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:35.119
to bring the truth to me, someone cared,

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:36.979
and now my soul is free.

00:12:36.979 --> 00:12:39.199
I know it wasn't easy to be bold enough to share,

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:42.359
but I am so glad, oh I am so glad

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:46.519
that someone cared enough to bring the truth to me.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:50.839
It ends with this, do you care?

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:55.839
What a challenging song to hear the songwriter

00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:59.839
give that testimony and then end with that question,

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.439
do you care?

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:03.399
See here in this passage of scripture,

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:07.319
we are immediately aware of these four individuals,

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:12.319
unnamed people, but they have concern, they have care.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:14.639
They have a friend who is sick of the palsy

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:19.359
who cannot get to the place where Jesus is.

00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:22.359
Therefore, they take action

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:26.759
and they bring this one to Jesus.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:28.359
We know, first of all, their concern.

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:30.799
Number two, I want you to note their confidence.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.439
I want you to note their confidence.

00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:33.919
As we look in the passage of scripture,

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:36.119
we're told immediately in verse number one

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.959
of where they are, they're in Capernaum,

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:40.399
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:43.479
that Jesus is there in Capernaum,

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:45.439
it's a place where he often went

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:47.599
when he was up in the Galilee region,

00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:49.119
the northern part of the country.

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.719
We find that many times when you study the scriptures,

00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:54.439
you'll find Jesus in Jerusalem

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:56.439
and the activities that are taking place there,

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:57.959
you'll see him up in Galilee,

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:01.159
and Capernaum was a place in which he often would be,

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:03.759
and you find that it's there, it's noised about,

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:07.519
it's made known that Jesus was back in town.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:10.479
He was in Capernaum, and so these men,

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:12.319
they hear that Jesus is there.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.919
There's no doubt in my mind

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.679
that there was no small stir concerning this.

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.359
There was a level of excitement.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.479
We find that as news is given

00:14:20.479 --> 00:14:24.319
that there are many that gather to Jesus.

00:14:24.319 --> 00:14:25.879
In fact, in verse number two,

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:28.679
the Bible tells us that there were so many that gathered

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:31.559
that there was no room to receive them.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:33.679
No, not so much as about the door.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.839
I mean, it's a packed house.

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:36.919
I mean, the people from Capernaum,

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.599
they hear that Jesus is there, and they come,

00:14:39.599 --> 00:14:43.999
and the Bible says that he's preaching the word unto them.

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.119
We do not have the content of the message

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:47.519
that Jesus was preaching.

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.919
We find in other portions of Scripture

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:52.559
that at times God would give us a record

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.639
of the messages that Jesus preached,

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:58.319
but we find that Jesus is teaching and he's preaching,

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:03.159
and in the midst of this message, there's an interruption.

00:15:04.199 --> 00:15:07.119
The interruption is caused by these four men

00:15:07.119 --> 00:15:08.719
that are concerned for their friend.

00:15:08.719 --> 00:15:12.239
These four men that bring this man that's sick of the palsy,

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:14.479
they cannot get into the home

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:16.519
because of the crowd that's gathered,

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:19.359
and we find that they're interrupting the meeting.

00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:21.319
They go upon the roof.

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:22.919
According to verse number four,

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:26.239
when they could not come nigh unto him for the press,

00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:28.719
they uncovered the roof where he was,

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.439
and we'll deal with the rest of verse number four

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:31.279
in just a moment,

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.599
but I want you to consider their confidence.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.759
See, these four men were confident

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:39.439
that Jesus could do something

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:43.059
about the condition of their friend.

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.479
They had confidence that Jesus was able,

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:50.919
whether it's that they've seen the miracles

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:52.019
that have been performed,

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:54.319
whether it was that they were recipients

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:55.779
of miraculous works.

00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:59.399
Maybe it's simply that they heard of the miracles of Jesus.

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:02.879
Whatever it was, they had confidence.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:07.519
They were convinced that Jesus could do something

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:10.159
about the condition of their friend,

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:12.919
and because of their confidence,

00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:17.239
because of their conviction that Jesus was able,

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:20.719
it led them to bring this man

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:23.919
that was sick of the palsy to Jesus.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:28.919
This morning, as we continue to make application

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:30.879
from this passage of Scripture

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:33.599
to our interaction with mankind,

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:36.019
those that God would allow us to interact with

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:38.179
on a daily, a regular basis,

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:41.499
I find this morning that we must have concern for them,

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:44.739
but we must have confidence in the power of the gospel.

00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:47.319
We must be confident this morning

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:51.239
that God is able to save to the uttermost,

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:54.399
that Jesus saves, amen?

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:57.239
We sang the song this morning, Saved, Saved,

00:16:57.239 --> 00:16:58.759
and what a wonderful song it is

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:01.679
to rejoice in the salvation that we have

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:03.399
through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:05.679
and we find that this morning,

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:09.639
the gospel still is effective today.

00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:11.519
The gospel still works.

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:14.159
The Bible tells us that the gospel

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.279
is the power of God unto salvation,

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:18.679
to everyone that believe it,

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:20.799
to the Jew first and also to the Greek,

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:23.239
and we find that the gospel, listen,

00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:26.919
because of your own personal testimony this morning,

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:28.439
if you're here this morning

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.519
and you were able to sing out that song,

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:34.759
Saved, Saved, and you know that you are heaven bound,

00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:36.719
not because of anything you've done,

00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:38.959
but because Christ saved you.

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:40.679
Remember what Paul said.

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:43.599
He said, this is a worthy, a faithful saying

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:45.159
and worthy of all acceptation

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:50.079
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:53.179
He continues and says, of whom I am chief.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:57.279
See, Paul knew personally the power of the gospel

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.039
because God saved him.

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:04.159
He remembered regularly and he rehearsed regularly

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:06.359
that account on the road to Damascus

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:08.759
as we would read of it in Acts chapter nine.

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:12.719
Paul was regularly aware of and rehearsed

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:15.239
of the moment, the day that he got saved

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:16.439
by the grace of God,

00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:20.239
and then he goes out and he preaches the gospel.

00:18:20.239 --> 00:18:24.039
Everywhere he goes, he's preaching the gospel, why?

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:27.359
Because he's confident that the gospel works.

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.879
He's confident that the gospel

00:18:29.879 --> 00:18:31.959
is the power of God unto salvation.

00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:35.959
He is confident that Jesus is able to save.

00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:38.919
He's confident that God loves

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:42.479
and God is not willing that any should perish.

00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:44.440
Every person that you come in contact with,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.239
every person that I come in contact with is a soul.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.119
They're gonna live forever,

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:54.559
either in heaven with our Savior

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.599
or they're gonna be tormented forever in the lake of fire.

00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.959
That's just the reality of scripture.

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:01.719
That's the truth of God's word.

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:04.880
And there's only one way to get to heaven.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.759
And that way is Jesus Christ.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.559
There are many, religion will tell you

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:14.279
and many different people will tell you,

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.000
oh, just be sincere, all roads lead to,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.959
and just do your best.

00:19:19.639 --> 00:19:22.599
And I can tell you on the authority of God's word,

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:24.479
that's not biblical.

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:26.039
That's not what God said.

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:31.479
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:33.839
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:37.320
Can I tell you this morning, it's not your works.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.719
You can't work your way to heaven.

00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:42.639
Not by works of righteousness, which we have done.

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:46.039
All of our works according to Isaiah is filthy rags.

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:49.639
God said that all have sinned

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.839
and come short of the glory of God.

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:53.759
We're all sinners.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:57.119
But we as, we would look at these four men

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:59.719
and their concern for their friends.

00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:04.419
And as we would try to make application this morning, just as they were concerned, but

00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:10.019
then just as they had confidence, we must have confidence in the message that God has

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:13.219
entrusted us to deliver.

00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:14.379
That message is powerful.

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:17.539
Listen, that message changed my life.

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:21.559
And for many of you this morning, you could stand and testify, that message changed my

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:23.899
life.

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:25.779
The gospel is powerful.

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:32.499
And this morning, just as we look at the actions of these men and we note their confidence,

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:33.499
why?

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:36.419
Because they said, we just need to get them to Jesus.

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:42.739
Because if we could get them to Jesus, then Jesus can do something about his condition.

00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:49.139
We find not only the concern and the confidence, but notice with me number three this morning,

00:20:49.139 --> 00:20:55.259
I want you to note their cooperation and their determination, but we note their cooperation

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:59.499
and determination as it's revealed here to us in the portion of scripture.

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:02.559
First of all, I want you to see that this was no easy task.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:07.219
In verse number three, the Bible tells us this man is sick of the palsy and these four

00:21:07.219 --> 00:21:10.059
men are going to bring him to Jesus.

00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:14.899
Now we do not know the distance by which they had to travel to bring him to the house where

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:20.779
Jesus was, but we find that if you're trying to transport someone in the heat of the day,

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:25.739
we were in Capernaum and we stood on the side of the Sea of Galilee several years ago

00:21:25.739 --> 00:21:30.059
as we were standing there listening to a message being delivered.

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.459
And I'm telling you, we just stood there.

00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.559
We weren't doing any kind of work.

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:38.259
And it was October, the end of October, supposed to be the cooler time of year, and we were

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:39.259
burning up.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:41.459
It was hot.

00:21:41.459 --> 00:21:43.059
It took them some hard work.

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:46.699
You ever try to carry dead weight?

00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:48.479
It's labor.

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:53.279
But they were concerned and they were confident, and so therefore there was this cooperation

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:56.479
and this determination, this man that would be born of four.

00:21:56.479 --> 00:22:01.479
There was no way that one man would be able to bring him on his own and the difficulties

00:22:01.479 --> 00:22:07.279
that would present themselves with this task of bringing this man to Jesus.

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:10.619
And so there was this cooperation.

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:17.759
We find that as they get there, there is revealed to us their determination because of the inability

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:22.919
for them to get into the home where Jesus was.

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:27.679
See, they faced obstacles.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:33.319
You know, as we try to give the gospel to people, we too will face obstacles.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:36.559
There will be those that would stand in the way.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:38.999
There will be some that say, hey, you can't talk about that here.

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:39.999
Hey, that's not allowed.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:44.559
That's…whatever they will say, the obstacles will present themselves.

00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:49.039
But we find that these individuals, though they arrive there and there's no way for

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:53.239
them to get in, and verse number four says, when they could not come nigh unto him, meaning

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:57.599
Jesus for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was.

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:01.759
When they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:06.999
Can you imagine, maybe in your mind's eye this morning, you can get the picture of these

00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:07.999
men.

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:12.839
Can you imagine them getting this man up onto the roof to begin with?

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:19.279
The difficulty, the way in which they would have to work together, that cooperation that

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:23.999
these four men, as they would bring this one sick of the palsy up onto the roof, and as

00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:28.399
they would then begin to break up the roof so that they could let him down again, there's

00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:30.359
a great need for cooperation.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:34.799
I mean, if you just let down your side before they let down his side, it's a real problem

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.679
with the arrival of this man.

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:40.479
And there's cooperation, but there's determination.

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:45.479
They were not going to stop.

00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:49.399
We don't read the text of Scripture that they arrived to the home and there was a great

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:52.439
crowd and so they went home.

00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:54.799
There was an obstacle so they gave up.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:55.799
No.

00:23:55.799 --> 00:24:02.999
They said, there's got to be a way that we can get this, our friend, to Jesus.

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:10.959
Because we know, we are confident that Jesus can do something about his condition.

00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:15.799
As we think about this thought of cooperation, I want you to hold your place here in Mark

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:19.239
and turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:25.399
In 1 Corinthians chapter number 3, it's a passage of Scripture that we've often referenced

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:32.719
with regard to the work that God has called us to do, but I want to remind you as we look

00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:38.919
here in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3, begin looking in verse number 4.

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:45.879
There was some division there in Corinth and it's summarized in verse number 4, for while

00:24:45.879 --> 00:24:50.319
one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are you not carnal?

00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:54.759
But then I want you to notice the truth by which we get to in verse number 5.

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:59.519
The Bible says, who then is Paul and who is Apollos?

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:02.839
You notice these words, but ministers.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:09.719
But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.

00:25:09.719 --> 00:25:13.319
Notice what Paul says, I have planted.

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:16.399
If you think about the Apostle Paul, and we're going to actually preach this evening on a

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:21.039
preach from Acts chapter 18, when you look at Paul arriving into Corinth, and we're going

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:24.839
to look at that portion of Scripture, but Paul says, I have planted.

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:31.239
You see, God used the Apostle Paul to enter into the city of Corinth to preach the gospel,

00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:36.039
to see a church established there, and he goes in and he plants, and he says, I have

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:44.719
planted, Apollos watered, but God, God gave the increase.

00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:51.759
So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:52.959
the increase.

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:57.999
Now, he that planteth and he that watereth, notice what it says, are one.

00:25:57.999 --> 00:25:59.639
They are one.

00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:03.319
And every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:11.159
And then notice this phrase in verse number 9, for we are laborers together with God.

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:14.439
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:19.759
What a blessing to understand that we are laborers together with God.

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:26.159
It is some plant and some water that we recognize that it's God that gives the increase, but

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:31.119
there must be this understanding that he that planteth and he that watereth are one.

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:37.799
There's a cooperation as we're seeking to take the truth of the gospel to a lost and

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:42.839
dying world, understanding their condition, understanding that they're hopeless and they're

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:51.799
helpless and understanding that I too and you as well were one day in that same position.

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:57.239
I don't know if you can remember when you were lost, but I can.

00:26:57.239 --> 00:27:01.439
I can remember what it was to have no peace.

00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:05.679
I can remember what it was to have fear of dying.

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:12.639
And especially after I had been confronted with the gospel at the age of almost 13, between

00:27:12.639 --> 00:27:17.319
that age and 17, not being saved, but being confronted with the truth of the gospel for

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:20.799
those long four years.

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:25.039
The knowledge that if I were to die without Christ, I'd spend eternity in the lake of

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.039
fire.

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:29.239
Those are some long, hard years.

00:27:29.239 --> 00:27:30.239
Why didn't you just get saved?

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:31.239
I don't know.

00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:32.239
I was hard-headed.

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:42.159
When I was 17, I finally waved that flag of surrender, said, Lord, I need a savior.

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:43.679
I know that you're the only savior.

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:44.679
I'm a sinner.

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:49.039
It was no hard thing for me to acknowledge that I was a sinner in the need of the only

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.039
savior.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:55.279
And I bowed my head and my heart and I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:58.879
And from that day until this day, I've not had those fears.

00:27:58.879 --> 00:28:01.239
I've not had that uncertainty.

00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:02.639
Why?

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:04.799
Because he gave me new life.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.159
He saved my soul.

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:08.999
He changed my life.

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:11.079
And we've experienced that.

00:28:11.079 --> 00:28:16.279
And I understand that there were some people that were cooperating in bringing the gospel

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:17.279
to me.

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:21.839
And then now, as we have the opportunity to be laborers together with God, that we're

00:28:21.839 --> 00:28:27.519
cooperating one with another and that God gives that opportunity to us.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:31.919
Ultimately, it's all for God's glory.

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:35.879
It's not so that the one that plants gets any recognition or even that the one that

00:28:35.879 --> 00:28:36.879
waters.

00:28:36.879 --> 00:28:39.159
But it's God that gave the increase.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:45.159
It's God that receives the glory that is due unto his name.

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:51.539
We find, as we look at this portion of Scripture in just the first four verses, five verses,

00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:57.599
we find here their concern, their confidence, their cooperation.

00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:03.959
In verse 5, we find that the Bible says, when Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:09.639
of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:13.039
Beginning in verse 5 and through the end of our text this morning in verse number 12,

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:17.239
we note number 4, the compassion of Christ.

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:19.679
I'm so thankful that our God is compassionate.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:20.679
He's gracious.

00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:21.879
He's merciful.

00:29:21.879 --> 00:29:26.919
I'm so thankful, as we look at this portion of Scripture, that though Jesus, in the midst

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:31.319
of his teaching, in the midst of the preaching, and this interruption that takes place, I

00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:34.239
mean, can you imagine the crowd as they're gathered together?

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.079
I mean, there are religious leaders here.

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:41.679
We know the scribes are there, and any time they showed up to one of Christ's messages,

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.839
they were there to find fault with them.

00:29:43.839 --> 00:29:44.919
They weren't there to learn.

00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:46.399
They weren't there to gain.

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:47.399
No, no, no.

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:52.779
They were there to find fault, to criticize, to cause others to doubt, and that was their

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:54.799
reason for being there.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:59.799
And we find, again, as they're gathered together in this likely a small place.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:03.819
a small home. There's so many people that are there, and then all of a sudden they

00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:09.099
hear the noise on the roof, and the tiles move over, and a guy is dropped

00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:15.239
by ropes. These four men are bringing this man down into the presence of Jesus.

00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:20.419
Can you imagine the crowd? Can you imagine as they're observing,

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:29.059
they're experiencing this interruption, and Jesus says that He saw their faith.

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:35.419
They believed that God was able, and the Bible says that He looked at that man

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:41.779
and said, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. That's pretty amazing as you look at

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:46.739
this portion of Scripture, and you think of all that's taking place, and how that

00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:54.699
Jesus focuses His attention upon this man. The four are, best as I can tell

00:30:54.699 --> 00:30:58.859
from the text of Scripture, they're still up on the roof, and this man is now there

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:03.739
in the presence of Jesus, and Jesus sees and understands what's taking place, and

00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:07.979
He speaks to this individual. I want you to understand this morning that in the

00:31:07.979 --> 00:31:13.259
midst of all the people, in the midst of a crowd, Jesus is concerned about the

00:31:13.259 --> 00:31:19.899
individual, and I love that truth. We find so often throughout the Gospel

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:28.499
records that Jesus, though He's thronged with people, though there's so many, so

00:31:28.499 --> 00:31:34.219
often the Scriptures deal with the individual. I said it earlier, God loves

00:31:34.219 --> 00:31:41.219
the entire world, but I'm so thankful that He loves us individually. See, God

00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:46.979
loves you this morning. God loves every person that you come into contact with.

00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:53.179
You say, well, they're not very lovable. Neither were you. Amen. But He loves. And

00:31:53.179 --> 00:32:00.179
we find that the greatest need of this man, though the friends were concerned

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:05.859
about his condition, his physical condition, the greatest need of this man was not

00:32:05.899 --> 00:32:12.899
his mobility. The greatest need of this man is the same need that is shared by

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:21.299
every human being, and that is forgiveness from sin. It's the greatest need of every

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:28.299
human being. We find this morning that only God can forgive sins. We look at the

00:32:28.979 --> 00:32:33.379
text of Scripture, and we find, as we've read earlier, that there were the scribes

00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:39.379
sitting there in verse number six, and we find that in verse number seven is their

00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:44.219
reasoning in their hearts, and their concern about the statement that Jesus makes with

00:32:44.219 --> 00:32:49.179
regard to the forgiveness of his sins, and they reason, and they say, who can forgive

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:56.099
sins but God only? So they had an understanding of proper biblical truth. You know, I can't

00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:00.219
forgive your sins, and you can't forgive my sins. There is nothing I can do to forgive

00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:06.539
your sins. Now I can forgive you as a person, and were commanded to do so in Ephesians 4.32,

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:11.979
but as far as your sin and the consequences, I can't forgive you. Only God can forgive

00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:18.819
you. These individuals, as I mentioned earlier, they did not understand that Jesus was God.

00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:25.579
They continued to resist that obvious truth throughout the life and ministry of the Lord

00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:32.579
Jesus Christ. So Jesus, he says to these scoffers, to these scribes, he says, whether

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:38.299
is it easier in verse number nine to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:45.299
thee, or to say, Arise and take up thy bed and walk? Which is easier? See, Jesus is dealing

00:33:46.779 --> 00:33:52.139
with the heart of the matter, with the most significant need of humankind, and that being

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:58.539
the sin condition of mankind. If Jesus had simply said, Take up thy bed and walk, and

00:33:58.539 --> 00:34:03.139
the man rose up and he walked, there'd be no interaction, there'd be no conversation

00:34:03.139 --> 00:34:09.859
with regard to sin. But we find that Jesus says in verse number 10, But that ye may know

00:34:09.859 --> 00:34:16.259
that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins. He then says to the man, Arise

00:34:16.259 --> 00:34:22.500
in verse number 11, Take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house. I'm so thankful

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.859
this morning to be forgiven. You know, it's a wonderful thing, a wonderful truth to be

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:34.299
forgiven. There's a song, Julianna sang it years ago, Forgiven Forever. There's only

00:34:34.299 --> 00:34:39.379
one way to be forgiven. We're talking about sin. We're talking about the context here

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:45.819
this morning of the sin of mankind. The only way to be forgiven, and we understand that

00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:50.779
God offers, freely offers forgiveness to mankind, it's only through the Lord Jesus

00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:58.459
Christ, through the precious blood that was shed on the cross of Calvary. And this morning,

00:34:58.459 --> 00:35:03.979
when we know in this text of Scripture the compassion of Christ, and we understand that

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:10.099
our God is gracious and He's loving and He's forgiving, we must rejoice in that truth.

00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:17.459
The Bible says in the book of Psalms that with thee there is forgiveness. What a joy

00:35:17.459 --> 00:35:26.059
to understand the means by which humankind can be forgiven. See, we were guilty. The

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:32.139
world is guilty. We need forgiveness. It only comes through Jesus Christ. Notice these verses

00:35:32.139 --> 00:35:36.459
with me. Ephesians chapter 1, if you will. We'll look at a few verses in the book of

00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:41.299
Ephesians, Colossians, and then we'll make our way back to the book of Acts and be done

00:35:41.299 --> 00:35:59.299
this morning. But look at Ephesians chapter 1. Ephesians chapter 1. In Ephesians 1, we

00:35:59.299 --> 00:36:04.539
find that the apostle Paul, writing to these believers in Ephesus, he calls them saints

00:36:04.539 --> 00:36:09.179
in verse number 1. The missionary journey had taken place. The gospel got to Ephesus

00:36:09.179 --> 00:36:14.379
and souls were saved. The church was established. And he speaks to them about their standing

00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:19.859
in Christ, their position in Christ. Really, we see that throughout the first, second,

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:24.379
and third chapter. But notice with me in verse number 6, he says, to the praise of the glory

00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:30.839
of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the beloved. Notice, in whom we have redemption

00:36:30.839 --> 00:36:37.919
through His blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace. What

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:43.159
of this morning? Do you know that you're forgiven? Do you know that your sins have been forgiven?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:49.319
You say, well, I'm working on that. You can't work on it. I'm trying to pay for them. You

00:36:49.319 --> 00:36:55.199
can't pay for them. It's already been paid for with the precious blood of Christ. You

00:36:55.199 --> 00:37:01.959
know what a sad thing. There are people sincerely, and I'm not being unkind, but there are people

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:08.679
that sincerely, this morning, have been deceived thinking that they can somehow pay for their

00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:17.279
own sins. That they can do some work, some action to pay for their sins, while Jesus

00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:25.039
says it's already been paid for. If righteousness came by the law, Paul says in the book of

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:31.959
Galatians, then Christ is dead in vain. Can I tell you this morning that Christ did not

00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:38.519
die in vain? He did not die in vain. He died on that cruel cross and He shed His precious

00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:48.519
blood because there was no other way for mankind to be forgiven. And He offered Himself willingly,

00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:54.519
once and for all, according to the book of Hebrews. I'm so thankful for that once and

00:37:54.519 --> 00:38:05.759
for all. Jesus said, it is finished. Paul says to these believers in Ephesus that they've

00:38:05.759 --> 00:38:11.639
been forgiven. Notice in chapter 2, beginning in verse number 1, he says,

00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:17.839
And you hath He quickened to be made alive, to be born again. See, because we were dead

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:22.519
in trespasses and sins. I mean, we were alive physically, we're dead spiritually.

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:29.039
It says in verse number 2, wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world,

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:33.359
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:39.839
disobedience. Notice this in verse number 3, among whom also we all had our conversation in times

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:44.679
past, and the lust of our flesh. Listen, if you're here this morning and you're saved, we sang the

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:49.479
song, Only a Sinner, Saved by Grace. If you're saved this morning, I'm thankful that I'm a child

00:38:49.479 --> 00:38:54.959
of God. I'm a joint heir with Christ. I am a saint, according to the scriptures. I am His child,

00:38:54.959 --> 00:39:02.880
hallelujah. But we all were in the same boat. We're all sinners in need of a Savior. And Paul

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.919
explains that clearly in verse number 3. We all had the same condition. Notice as we continue in

00:39:08.919 --> 00:39:13.679
verse number 3, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:23.839
children of wrath, even as others. You were born that way. Why? Because sin comes through Adam.

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:32.440
It's passed on. We have a sin nature. He says this in verse 4, I love the first two words,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:40.119
but God. But God. Changes the whole course of this passage of scripture. But God,

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:51.640
who is rich in mercy. Notice, for His great love, wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:59.159
sins, hath quickened us together with Christ by grace, your saint, and hath raised us up together

00:39:59.159 --> 00:39:59.640
and

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.400
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.240
that in the ages to come He might show

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.620
the exceeding riches of His grace and His kindness

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.280
toward us through Christ Jesus,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.080
for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.960
Notice, and that not of yourselves,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.420
it is the gift of God, not of works,

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.220
lest any man should boast.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.060
Verse 10, for we are His workmanship

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.160
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.400
which God hath before ordained

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.140
that we should walk in them.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.600
It's a gift.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.940
If you could earn it, if you could work for it,

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.820
it's not a gift, and you would have reason to boast.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.680
You know what you could say?

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.120
I made it.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.180
I made it to heaven.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.420
I was good enough.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.880
But God says none of us are good enough.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.220
No one that you interact with is good enough.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.300
They need to understand the gospel,

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.640
the death, burn, and resurrection,

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.140
and the fact that not by works,

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.680
as we see here, lest any man should boast.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.980
Now, verse 10 deals with we are His workmanship

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.020
in Christ Jesus.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.380
Now, we understand that after we're saved,

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.560
those works that we would do, those good works,

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.960
they're not for salvation.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.420
They're not to earn it, and they're not to keep it.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.260
You know why?

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.760
I'm kept by the power of God.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.660
He gave me eternal life.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.100
He said that the gift that He gave me,

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.040
that it would never perish, that I would never perish,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.940
because He said, I give unto them eternal life,

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.040
and they shall never perish in John 10 in verse 27.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.780
Peter says that we're kept by the power of God,

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.340
that we have an inheritance

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.740
that's reserved in heaven for us.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.380
It's no corruption.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.340
It's not defiled.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.980
I mean, it's reserved for us.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.380
He didn't say that I give you probationary life.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.260
He didn't say I give you temporary life.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.860
He said, I give you eternal life.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:56.960
And this is the message

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.320
that God has entrusted us to give to people,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.720
that we understand their condition,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.460
and it draws to us in some capacity

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.500
this measure of concern for those that we interact with,

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.460
that they're going to die one day,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.300
and if they die without Christ,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.540
they will spend eternity in the lake of fire.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.380
It ought to concern us.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.540
It ought to give us some care,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:28.180
because we have confidence that Jesus saves.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.880
Jesus saves.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.240
Jesus saves.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.980
We have confidence in the power of the gospel.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:42.080
We cooperate one with another to bring people to Jesus.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.560
Why?

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.060
Because Jesus is compassionate.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.560
Because Jesus cares.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.100
Because Jesus loves.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.880
Because Jesus forgives.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.680
We find that here in this passage of scripture,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.680
we are rejoicing in our newfound position in Christ,

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.540
that we're saved by the grace of God,

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:08.060
that we're his children,

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.140
and he's given us this task of being his representatives.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.740
Look over the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter 13.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.940
In Acts chapter number 13,

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.300
we find it's really the record

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.060
of the first missionary journey,

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.020
as God would separate Paul and Barnabas.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.860
In fact, it's early on in this chapter

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.860
where his name is changed to Paul from Saul.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.420
We find that they're going throughout the region of Galatia.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.800
They're going from city to city and preaching,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.440
and they're dealing with much opposition, by the way.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.200
In every place where they find themselves,

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.320
there's opposition.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.340
In fact, there are times in which

00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:00.080
the opposition is exceeding great.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.420
They're chased out of city.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.240
We find that at the end of chapter number 14

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.840
that Paul, on that same missionary journey,

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.960
that he's stoned and left for dead.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.040
We find here in the midst of Acts chapter 13,

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.440
I want you to find and look at verse 37 with me

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.600
as Paul is preaching here.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.960
This is in verse 37,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.840
but he whom God raised again saw no corruption.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.200
He's speaking of Jesus.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.120
And notice where he says,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.200
"'Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.000
"'that through this man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.180
"'God in flesh, is preached unto you

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.300
"'the forgiveness of sins.'"

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.000
That's the message that we preach,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.780
is a message of forgiveness, a message of hope,

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.600
a glorious message.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.640
The gospel literally is the good news.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.700
And if we're not careful this morning,

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.780
we can get so busy, we can get so distracted,

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.380
that we go through life almost like we have blinders on,

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.660
and we don't see the opportunities

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.100
that God would give us.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.340
So we need to have concern.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.060
One of this morning, how concerned are you

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.940
for your neighbors, the ones that annoy you?

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.500
How concerned are you for them?

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:30.220
Your coworkers, the one that doesn't pull their weight

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.300
in the office.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.500
You understand what I'm saying to you this morning.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.380
Their soul, they need Jesus.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.620
We have friends and family members,

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.380
people that we randomly come into contact with.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.300
We have concern for them.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.600
I'll close with this true testimony.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.580
Many of you would know,

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.300
there's a man that came to church here

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.640
for a number of years, sporadically,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.300
on a Sunday evening, really only.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.060
His name was Chris.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.580
And Chris would come, and Chris would fight,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.300
and he'd argue, and he'd debate.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.860
He'd say ugly things.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.420
I mean, just carry on.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.740
Some of you had conversation with him, and you know.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.580
He'd have conversation with my wife,

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.520
and he'd say some ugly things to her.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.340
And he'd say to her something like this,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.080
he'd say, stop praying for me.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.640
Because my wife would say, I'm praying for you.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.000
You know, he'd say, stop praying for him

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.680
because it was convicting him,

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.920
because he was lost.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.600
And I'll never forget, Chris looked at me one night,

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.720
with all sincerity, and he said this,

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.080
why do you care?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.880
Why do you care?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.440
And he followed that statement up with this one.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.000
I don't care if I die and go to hell.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.120
So why do you care?

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.980
Now that's a, whew, that's a crazy statement.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.280
But that's what he said to me.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.180
You know, for a number of years, really,

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.760
we just tried to show love and compassion and care.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.740
He'd show up three or four Sunday nights in a row,

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.920
and then you wouldn't see him for months.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.040
Many of you know.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.360
There was a Saturday afternoon

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.120
that Chris showed up here to church.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.480
He just kind of sat out on the front porch.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.120
I wasn't in my office, and I wasn't aware of him being here,

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.080
and then after a little while, I saw that he was here,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.400
I think actually one of my kids said,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.720
hey, somebody's up at the church,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.560
and came walking over here, and it was Chris.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.360
And we walked about 20 feet into the fellowship hall

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.880
at the first table, and he got on his knees

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.280
in that fellowship hall, and he prayed

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.720
and asked Christ to save him.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.080
But he said, why do you care?

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.360
You know why we care?

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.060
Because we understand the truth of the Bible.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.120
And here's what I told Chris.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.360
I said, Chris, I randomly, regularly knock on people's door

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.960
that I don't even know to try to share with them

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.160
the truth of the gospel.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.359
You've come to our church, and guess what?

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:40.359
It's because Brother, Miss Sundeen, what's his name?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.320
Smallwood, Brother Smallwood worked with Chris

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.799
and said, you need to go to church,

00:48:45.799 --> 00:48:47.280
you need to go to Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.679
Brother Smallwood wasn't even a member of this church,

00:48:50.679 --> 00:48:53.000
but he said, you need to go to Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.840
and he showed up, and years later, he got saved.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.480
Listen, there are people that just need somebody to care,

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.420
to have concern.

00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:09.200
See, are you confident this morning

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.940
in the truth of the gospel?

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.520
I mean, I'm confident that Jesus will save.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:20.480
He'll save anyone, because he is the Savior of the world.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.840
If someone comes humbly, acknowledging that they're a sinner

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.880
in need of the Savior, and they bow their head and heart

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.200
and confess and forsake, and they believe Christ,

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.239
and he said that he'd say, for whosoever shall call

00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:35.000
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.059
What a joy to be able to deliver this glorious message.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.320
I'm concerned sometimes that we can just get too busy

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.480
in life, we can get too distracted.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.720
By the way, that's exactly what the enemy wants us to do,

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.440
is be distracted and be busy, and not be about the work

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.840
that God has given us to do.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:06.760
to. We are His representatives. We are His ambassadors. This morning, we need to be bringing

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:12.960
people to Jesus. Just as these four men, unnamed. Why are they unnamed? Because it doesn't matter

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.560
who they are. They just brought somebody to Jesus. We don't even know His name. But we

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.640
know Jesus and we know that He receives the glory. And those scribes and all those there,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.960
they said, we have never seen it like this before. And they glorified God. That's what

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.800
it's all about. That's what it's all about. This morning, bringing people to Jesus. Let's

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.280
pray. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.700
the privilege of being your representatives, your ambassadors. And God, I pray this morning

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.840
as we look at this portion of Scripture and we understand contextually and historically

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:56.840
the event that took place. God, as we've taken opportunity to make application in our own

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.840
lives with regard to the spiritual condition of those that we come in contact with on

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:12.040
a daily basis. God, I pray that you'd help us to be used of thee to bring people to Jesus,

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.640
to bring them to you, Lord. I pray that you would have your will and way in the midst

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:24.000
of this time of invitation. Lord, if there's someone here, someone that's tuned in via

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.840
live stream that's not sure of heaven, they were thinking that they might go to heaven.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:35.520
They're hoping that they'd go to heaven. They're trying to do their best that they could go

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:45.200
to heaven. God, I pray today that you would convince them of the truth of your Word, that

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:51.760
Jesus is the only Savior. They cannot work their way. They cannot be good enough. God,

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.520
I pray that you'd work to that end. For those of us that are saved, oh God, would you help

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:05.280
us to be yielded and surrendered, to be your servants, to have that care and concern, to

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:12.520
have that confidence to cooperate one with another so that we might see souls saved and

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.560
lives changed. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do in the time of invitation.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.080
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
