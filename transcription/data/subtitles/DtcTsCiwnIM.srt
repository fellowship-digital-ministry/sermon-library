1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Psalm 119, and I've titled the message this evening,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,639
Oh, How Love I Thy Law.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,479
Of course, we're familiar with that phrase

4
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:13,060
as we'd consider Psalm 119 and verse number 97.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,319
Psalm 119 is a wonderful passage of scripture.

6
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:18,760
Of course, it's the longest psalm in all of the Bible,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,719
176 verses, and as you look at the psalm,

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,760
you find that all but a handful of verses

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,680
actually have some reference in them to God's word.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,959
Sometimes it's referred to as thy statutes,

11
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:35,279
thy judgments, thy testimonies, thy word.

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,959
There's all sorts of various phrases

13
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,319
that are used all in speaking about the word of God

14
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:45,240
and how thankful I am this evening that we have a Bible.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,520
I mean, it's a tremendous truth

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,020
and reality that we have here,

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,979
that every service, when I stand up behind this pulpit,

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,080
I mean, without really thinking about it,

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,639
I say, take your Bible and turn to.

20
00:00:58,599 --> 00:00:59,639
Why do I say that?

21
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, number one, I've been given the responsibility

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,519
to preach the word, and so when we get behind the pulpit,

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,059
we're preaching God's book, God's word,

24
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:10,739
but I also have gotten into the routine of saying that

25
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,239
because you have a Bible and you bring a Bible

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,860
and you can turn to the pages in your Bible

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,040
and you have, if you did not bring a Bible with you,

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,360
each of our pews, we have pew Bibles

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,739
and we wanna have people using the word

30
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,699
and opening the Bible,

31
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,319
and so without even thinking really much about it,

32
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,379
I say, hey, if you have your Bibles,

33
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,220
I said it this way tonight,

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,300
take your Bible and turn to Psalm 119.

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,839
That's what I said when I got up here.

36
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:37,680
Why?

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,860
Because we have a Bible.

38
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,779
How many of you remember when Brother Jim Savalli was here,

39
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:43,980
our missionary to Samoa?

40
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,260
Some of you remember when he was here,

41
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,019
and he said this when he was here,

42
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,540
and I remember talking to him afterwards and since.

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,220
I've had some opportunities to fellowship

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,900
with Brother Savalli, and he made this statement.

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,500
He said, I remember in our church in Samoa,

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,419
the very first time I could ever say,

47
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,540
take your Bible and turn to,

48
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,839
and actually hear the pages of a Bible turning,

49
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:08,779
because until that point, no one had a Bible

50
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,419
because there were no Bibles available.

51
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,979
And sometimes we don't really understand

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,139
how blessed we have been.

53
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,740
I mean, honestly, to have a Bible,

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,000
most of us have multiple copies.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,059
We have Bibles on our,

56
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,419
how many of you have a Bible on your phone, your iPad?

57
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,479
You got a Bible, right?

58
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,880
You're sitting in the doctor's office,

59
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,259
and they said to be there at nine,

60
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,660
and they don't see you until 10,

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,020
unless you go to Brother Magnus'.

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,979
I know he's right on time all the time.

63
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,779
But the reality is that you sit there,

64
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,279
you can pull, I went to the dentist a few weeks ago.

65
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,179
I could pull out my phone, and I can access it.

66
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,660
It's amazing what we have.

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,300
The psalmist here in Psalm 119,

68
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,860
he's speaking so much about the Bible,

69
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,779
and he comes to verse 97,

70
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,619
and he says,

71
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,779
oh, how love I thy law, it, thy law,

72
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:58,500
is my meditation all the day.

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,160
Begin to think about that truth

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,300
and what he's proclaiming there.

75
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,860
Begin to think about the way in which you have opportunity

76
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,699
to open the Bible, to read the Bible,

77
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,419
and then to literally have the truth of God's word

78
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,240
on your heart and on your mind throughout the day.

79
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,419
I enjoy, I personally like reading my Bible

80
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,779
early in the morning,

81
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,820
not that I would not read it in the afternoon or evening,

82
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,179
but I enjoy reading it in the morning,

83
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:28,419
having my time with God every morning,

84
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:29,899
getting into the word.

85
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:30,740
Why?

86
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,779
Because throughout the day,

87
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,139
God will bring back to my heart and my mind

88
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,100
truth that I had read earlier in the day.

89
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,139
And here the psalmist says,

90
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,339
it is my meditation all the day,

91
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:44,679
that we read God's word, and we love God's word,

92
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,479
and we have this idea that when we go throughout the day,

93
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,279
that we're reminded and we're meditating upon,

94
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,460
literally musing upon, chewing on, if you will,

95
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,419
the truth that God revealed to us.

96
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,320
We find that throughout the passage of scripture

97
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,820
that the psalmist doesn't simply make the declaration

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,679
in verse 97, if you will.

99
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,759
Skip down and look at verse 140 with me.

100
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,800
Notice what the Bible says here.

101
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,820
Again, the psalmist still speaking,

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,059
and he says, thy word is very pure.

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,079
Therefore, thy servant loveth it.

104
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,600
The psalmist recognized something to be true

105
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
about God's word.

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,559
He says that it's very pure.

107
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:33,760
It reminds me of truth that we have previous in our Bibles

108
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,839
in Psalm chapter 12, where the Bible says

109
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,059
in verse number six, the words of the Lord are pure words.

110
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:44,440
As silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times,

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,399
thou shalt keep them, O Lord.

112
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,399
Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever.

113
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,200
Only God could make that promise,

114
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,019
and only God could keep that promise because he's eternal.

115
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,079
We find that the psalmist says, thy word is very pure.

116
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,079
Listen, this book, the Bible,

117
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,160
there's nothing like it in all the world.

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,519
There's not another book that you'll ever read

119
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,160
that has the power or the purity that this book has.

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,440
It is the mind of God, it is the very word of God.

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,480
And we find that he says, therefore,

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,519
because of my understanding of it being very pure,

123
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,799
therefore thy servant loveth it.

124
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:28,079
Skip down and notice in verse number 163,

125
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,640
the Bible says, I hate and abhor lying,

126
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,399
but thy law do I love.

127
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,720
We think about this phrase, I hate and abhor lying,

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,600
no doubt we understand that we do not enjoy

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,220
when someone tells us lies,

130
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,000
when someone's peddling falsehood,

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,559
when someone is giving false teaching.

132
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:54,059
And he says, but thy law do I love.

133
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,079
And in this same Psalm,

134
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,720
notice a couple of verses down in verse 165,

135
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,720
great peace have they which love thy law,

136
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,000
and nothing shall offend them.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We should think about the truth of Psalm 118, 165,

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,839
great peace have they which love thy law.

139
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,679
Why?

140
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,799
Because the person that loves the law of the Lord,

141
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:21,119
the person that loves the word is gonna be in the word.

142
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,640
The person that loves the word

143
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,359
is going to spend time with God,

144
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,679
going to learn more about God,

145
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,200
and it's gonna have a great impact,

146
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,640
great peace have they which love thy law.

147
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,239
And he's already declared, I love thy law.

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,079
In verse 167, just a few verses down, he says,

149
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,399
my soul hath kept thy testimonies,

150
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,480
and then notice how he words it here,

151
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,119
and I love them exceedingly.

152
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,720
I love them exceedingly.

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,799
It's interesting that we find

154
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,040
these declarations of the psalmist,

155
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,160
really, we see five of them that we've looked at

156
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,880
with regard to four specifically

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,640
that speaks about how he loves,

158
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,559
and then the result in verse 165.

159
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,559
But I want you to back up, if you will.

160
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,000
We skipped over one of the verses, and that's in 159.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,559
I want you to notice here, the Bible says this,

162
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:17,559
consider how I love thy precepts.

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,079
Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindness.

164
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,519
It's interesting to me as I read verse 159 in Psalm 119,

165
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,600
the psalmist has made the declaration in verse 97,

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,720
the other verses that we've read a moment ago,

167
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,440
he makes the declaration that he loves God's word.

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,399
But then in Psalm 119 in verse 159,

169
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,720
as he's praying to the Lord, he says,

170
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,040
consider how I love thy precepts.

171
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,720
It's one thing for us to declare our love for God's word.

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,839
It's quite another thing for us to say to God,

173
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,679
consider how I love thy precepts.

174
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,720
I mean, the reality is that when we talk

175
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,200
and we understand this evening about the Bible,

176
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,760
and we spent two days this week on Friday and Saturday

177
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,440
putting scriptures together

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,040
and having that opportunity at Scripture Assembly

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,440
to put nearly 22,000 John and Romans together, why?

180
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,019
Well, because we love the Bible,

181
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,079
but we want the truth of God's word to be given to those

182
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,480
who do not have it readily available.

183
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,839
Why is it that Beacon of Truth is printing Bibles

184
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,600
and engaged in the work?

185
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
Why is it that we give to a ministry

186
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,799
to print portions of scripture

187
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:34,799
from tracts and John and Romans, Romans booklets,

188
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
New Testaments, full Bibles?

189
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,559
Why?

190
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,400
Because we know the power of God's word,

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,840
we love God's word, and we want other people to have it.

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,320
So we labor, we work, we give of our resources

193
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
so that the word can be published,

194
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
so that the word can be proclaimed

195
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,440
and be distributed around the world.

196
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,359
But we come this evening to the personal nature

197
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,719
of what the psalmist says,

198
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:01,760
oh, how love I thy law.

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,239
There's many reasons that we should love God's word.

200
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,840
We looked at one there in Psalm 140,

201
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,479
in Psalm 119, verse 140,

202
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,640
where he says that thy word is very pure.

203
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,340
We understand this book is a perfect book.

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,679
This book is God's book, it's perfect.

205
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,619
The source, all scripture.

206
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:19,460
How much scripture?

207
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,320
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

208
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,340
What a joy to know the book that we hold in our hands,

209
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:28,780
that this book is pure,

210
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,179
that this book is the very word of God.

211
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,919
It's inspired by God.

212
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,340
We find that the psalmist said,

213
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,700
as we looked in Psalm 12, but in Psalm 19,

214
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,940
in verse number seven,

215
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,900
the psalmist makes this declaration

216
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,940
with regard to God's word.

217
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,179
The law of the Lord is perfect.

218
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,900
It's perfect.

219
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,020
I've read books, I have a number of them on my bookshelf.

220
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,919
I've read books that have errors.

221
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,719
Never found an error in the Bible.

222
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,559
Oh, I've had people come to me and said they.

223
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,599
found errors. You know what I find most often, Mark? They just really went to a website somewhere

224
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:10,119
and they looked up errors in the Bible and they just took some man's word for the fact

225
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:14,639
that there's a contradiction or an error. I often have said, oh, there's, the book is

226
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,119
full of contradictions. You ever have anyone tell you that? And I hand them my Bible and

227
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:21,239
say, well, if it's full of them, can you show me one? Well, I don't, I don't know any off

228
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:26,279
the top of my head. You just kind of laugh and just kind of carry on. But the reality

229
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:34,839
is that someone said this, if you think there's a mistake, you're mistaken. See, some of the

230
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:43,359
truth of God's word requires that we dig and we dig and we labor and we labor. I remember

231
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:48,399
hearing a preacher say this, and I remember exactly the number of years we was at a conference

232
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,439
that we're at last July. And there was one portion of scripture that he struggled with

233
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:58,599
understanding and he prayed for years that God would give him an understanding of that

234
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,639
portion of scripture. And he stood before us and he testified at what joy it was when

235
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,720
God finally revealed to him the truth of that portion of scripture that he had prayed over

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,399
and labored over. This book is amazing. It's a perfect book. I'm thankful that God preserved

237
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,479
it. Wouldn't it be, we understand this evening the truth of inspiration. All scripture is

238
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:26,720
given by inspiration of God. And inspiration is important Bible doctrine. It's absolutely

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,599
imperative that we understand that all scripture is given by inspiration. There are people

240
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:34,519
today that would like to make you think and would like to peddle their ideas that it's

241
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,399
just man's words that man wrote. No, it's God's word and we can rest assured of that.

242
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,119
But we also understand that God not only inspired His word, but He preserved His word. And that

243
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:53,439
wonderful truth of preservation is so important for us this evening. Why? We don't have the

244
00:11:53,439 --> 00:12:01,199
originals. In fact, when Paul was writing and he says to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter

245
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:07,000
number 4, bring these things and especially the parchments. Those were copies of copies

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,479
of copies of copies. He didn't have the originals either, but God said that He would preserve

247
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:20,959
His word. And we hold in our hands this evening the very preserved book that God has given

248
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,880
to us. We understand this evening here, even in Psalm 119, in verse number 89, the Bible

249
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:36,360
says this, forever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven. In verse 160 of Psalm 119, the

250
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Bible says this, it says, Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of Thy righteous

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,880
judgments endureth forever. How many of them? It says every one. Only God can do that. Only

252
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:59,440
God can do that. That reminds us this evening of how blessed we are to have the preserved

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,759
book, the preserved word of God. I find that this book is profitable often as we deal with

254
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,080
the truth of 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 16 and we talk about the fact that

255
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,119
all scripture is given by inspiration of God, but it says that it's profitable. It's

256
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:19,479
profitable. Why do we read the Bible? We'll get to that in just a few moments, but we

257
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:25,839
understand that we read it because it's a profit to us. It benefits us. Why is it that

258
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,559
we hear the preaching of God's word? Why is it that the preacher has been given the responsibility

259
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,199
to preach the word? Because it's the word that changes lives. It's the word that's profitable.

260
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:44,199
It's God's word. We find this evening that this book is profitable. I'm reminded of Joshua

261
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,520
one and verse number eight. In fact, many of you, uh, we could, we could quote the verse,

262
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,080
but I want you to go back there and I want you to look at what's happening in Joshua

263
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,239
chapter number one. And I want you to consider, uh, just some truth about this and Joshua

264
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:02,919
one and all the circumstances that are taking place with regard to Moses. In fact, in verse

265
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:08,279
number one, the Bible says now after the death of Moses, now this is a simple question

266
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,959
this evening, but who is the human penman for the first five books of the Bible? Moses,

267
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:20,040
right? The Pentateuch, we often refer to the law, the Pentateuch, the books of Moses and

268
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:28,179
those first five books, God used Moses to pen those. And, uh, he's the human penman,

269
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,679
but we find that the Bible says now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,

270
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,519
it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son of none, Moses, his minister

271
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,639
saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this

272
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,600
people unto the land, which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. We're not

273
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,679
going to go through the entirety here, but we find that there's a promise given in verse

274
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,200
number five, there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life.

275
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,859
As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee nor forsake thee. Moses

276
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:11,559
left a couple of very important things. Number one, he left a great example for Joshua. Moses

277
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:17,760
was a faithful minister. Moses was a man that, uh, was, was faithful in all his house. He

278
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,639
did so many wonderful things. God used him greatly. And we find that he had influence

279
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:31,720
in the life of Joshua. But I want you to understand that Moses also left a book. He left a book.

280
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,160
And we find that the Bible says as God gives to Joshua this promise of victory and he says,

281
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,760
be strong in verse number six and have a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide

282
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,679
for an inheritance the land, which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou

283
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:54,399
strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which

284
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,720
Moses, my servant, commanded thee, turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that

285
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,639
thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. And then here's the verse in verse number

286
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:14,480
eight, this book of the law, this book of the law, Moses was faithful to, to, to write

287
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,799
down what God had commanded him to write down. Yes, he was faithful. You find throughout

288
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,559
the pages of the Pentateuch that God would say to Moses, say this to my people, and then

289
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:31,119
you'll see where Moses goes and says this to his people. Moses was faithful. He says,

290
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:38,639
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein.

291
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:47,799
Notice what it says, day and night. For what purpose? That thou mayest observe, what does

292
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:59,919
it say? To do. To do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make

293
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:07,320
thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success. This evening I have this verse

294
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,320
of scripture. I have just four little phrases, really three of them are just words, single

295
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:20,239
words that are underlined in my Bible. The first phrase is to do. The second one is all.

296
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,760
And then the next two that I have underlined, both of them the same word then. We understand

297
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,799
when then occurs. Then is a sequence of events, if you will. It's a time, it's an order. And

298
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,200
we find here this evening that the then of verse number eight in Joshua chapter number

299
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,119
one, we desire. What is the then? It's to make thy way prosperous. It's to have good

300
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,440
success. Praise the Lord. I mean, that's what we want. That's our desire. That's our goal.

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,359
But the reality is we never get there if we're not meditating there in day and night. If we're

302
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:58,339
not doing that, getting into God's word so that we could do according to all that is

303
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:04,380
written therein. We're not going to do what we do not know. You say, well, that's pretty

304
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,299
basic I know. The message tonight is actually very basic. But sometimes you've got to get

305
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:15,500
back to the basics. You've got to get back to the basics. You're not going to do what

306
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,139
you don't know. It's just not going to happen. So we've got to get into the book, get into

307
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:26,380
the Bible, allow the Bible to get into us and understand that we need to do all that

308
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:34,659
is written therein. I pray, I think almost every single time that I pray when I enter

309
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:40,900
into my time of devotions personally and when I enter into this pulpit, I pray God help

310
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,460
us to be doers of the word and not hearers only. Why? Well, because James one tells us

311
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,460
that it's, we're deceiving ourselves if we're hearers and we're not doers. We're to be doing

312
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,260
the word. Yes, we have to hear it, but we must make a commitment to doing it. I want

313
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,820
you to understand this evening the book that we hold in our hands is powerful. It's powerful.

314
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,739
Notice with me a truth in Jeremiah chapter 23. In Jeremiah chapter 23 this evening we

315
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:19,419
see these words written with regard to the power of God's word. This book that we hold,

316
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:27,260
dear, that we hold in our hands this evening, in Jeremiah chapter 23 and verse number 28,

317
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:33,299
notice what the Bible says. The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream. And he

318
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:42,700
that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the

319
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:53,619
Lord? Chaff is useless rubbish. That's what it is. But wheat, it's profitable. Wheat,

320
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:59,380
it's nourishing. You want to separate the chaff from the wheat, do you not?

321
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,320
They would do that, it was a, we understand the purpose, the process, and we find here

322
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,960
that God says, what is the chaff to the wheat?

323
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,960
And then he says this in verse 29, is not my word like as a fire, saith the Lord, and

324
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,640
like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?

325
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,100
Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that steal my words every

326
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,860
one from his neighbor.

327
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,740
God's word is powerful.

328
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,900
So often as we think about the declaration of the psalmist this evening, again, there's

329
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,920
many reasons in which we would agree with the psalmist, oh, how love I thy law.

330
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,580
We love God's word.

331
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,740
We love the Bible.

332
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,900
But I ask this question of myself, and I ask you this evening as we look at this thought

333
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,940
tonight and consider this truth from Psalm 119, is the, does the evidence, or is there

334
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,140
evidence that supports the claim?

335
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,900
We can claim just about anything we want to claim, but what does the evidence say?

336
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,900
What does the evidence support?

337
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,920
If we say we love something, then there should be evidence to support the claim.

338
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,840
And here this evening, we begin to think about this declaration, oh, how love I thy law.

339
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,200
There ought to be something in the life of the psalmist, there ought to be something

340
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,840
in your life and my life that would support the claim if we're going to say I love God's

341
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,240
word.

342
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,680
I would say very basically this evening in a very simple idea is that we, number one,

343
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,760
would read the Bible.

344
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,280
Just read the Bible.

345
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,880
I don't like reading.

346
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Learn to.

347
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,360
This book is not like any other book.

348
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,080
I don't have time to read.

349
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,320
You better make time.

350
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Let me rephrase that.

351
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
You better steward time.

352
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,660
I often say to Joseph and to our other children and to many of you, you cannot make time.

353
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,880
We cannot make time.

354
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960
We are stewards of time.

355
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,380
We can't make time.

356
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,360
We steward time.

357
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,320
You better steward time to read God's word.

358
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
It's not going to happen on accident.

359
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,160
It's not going to happen by chance.

360
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,360
You're going to have to purpose to read God's word.

361
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,320
We give out the Bible reading schedules.

362
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,919
I don't have any up here in the daily devotional that we gave you.

363
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,720
There's a Bible reading schedule in there.

364
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,300
There's all sorts of things that you can use.

365
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,919
You can use apps and so on and so forth that give you a daily reading schedule.

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,440
Can I tell you this evening that we're not reading the Bible simply to fill out a book

367
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,700
that we hand you in the beginning of the year?

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,400
That we give you this book that gives you so many chapters each day and so on and so

369
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
forth?

370
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
No.

371
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
We're giving you the book as a tool.

372
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,559
But we don't read the Bible so that we can check off that little box that's there in

373
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,559
that little booklet.

374
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,559
No.

375
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,200
We're not reading the Bible because we understand what the Bible is.

376
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,600
And if we love the Bible, we better be reading the Bible.

377
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,360
And if we're not reading the Bible, then we can't claim to love the Bible because the

378
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,559
evidence doesn't support the claim.

379
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,680
It's sad to me this evening that you can look at, and I understand statistics, and I shared

380
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,279
some statistics in the message this morning, and I understand the statistics can be skewed

381
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,320
one way or the other and so on and so forth.

382
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,040
I get all of that.

383
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,800
But the statistics do reveal something, and there's a number of statistics that have been

384
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,440
given over the last couple of decades with regard to the number of people that are professing

385
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,760
Christians that have never read Genesis to Revelation.

386
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,639
They've never read the entire Bible in their entire Christian life.

387
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,520
People that admit, acknowledge that they don't read the Bible daily.

388
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,919
They go to church, they believe the Bible is God's word, but they don't read the Bible.

389
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,639
This evening, Paul tells Timothy, and I understand that it's within the context of Paul coming

390
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:20,640
to where Timothy is, but he says, till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation,

391
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
to doctrine.

392
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,119
We teach our children to read the Bible.

393
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,119
Why?

394
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,480
Because we know what the Bible is.

395
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
We know what the Bible is capable of doing.

396
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,640
We know that it's God's word, that it's perfect, it's preserved, it's profitable.

397
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,239
We understand the power of God's word, so we teach them to read it.

398
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:46,959
I've not kept track over the years how many times I've read through the Bible from cover

399
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,080
to cover.

400
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,800
But I never get to the point where I finish reading the Bible and I say, well, I guess

401
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,720
I don't have to read it again.

402
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
No.

403
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,279
I just start right back the next day in Genesis 1.

404
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,559
I've shared with you from the pulpit before, I'm the kind of, I like reading Genesis to

405
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,200
Revelation, Genesis, that's just how I like reading it.

406
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,320
I understand the chronological aspect of it, I understand all of that, I'm not interested

407
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,040
really too much in the chronological reading of it, that's just my own preference.

408
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,239
I've done it that way before and I think it's good to be able to understand the chronological

409
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,920
order of things.

410
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm not one for reading some old and some, I just like doing it that way.

411
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,320
We all have our preference.

412
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,559
Somebody said this, I don't like the way, they were speaking to D. L. Moody, I don't

413
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,679
like the way that you share the Gospel.

414
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,480
And he said, okay, well, why don't you tell me how you do it?

415
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
He said, well, I don't.

416
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,040
And he said, well, I like my way better than your way.

417
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,279
You may have a preference on how you read, whether you read some old and some new, whether

418
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,779
you read, but you better be reading it, better be reading it.

419
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:01,660
The entrance of thy word, give it light.

420
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,339
As newborn babes desire the cereal milk of the word that you may grow thereby.

421
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:11,580
Strong me, in Hebrews chapter number 5, belonging to them who are full age.

422
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,660
In the time, he says in the same passage, that you ought to be teachers, you have need

423
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,420
that one teach you, and we find that we must be reading the Bible.

424
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,820
Bible reading is so important.

425
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,220
We sing the song with the little kids.

426
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,660
In fact, if I called the kids up here this evening to sing it, they'd sing it for you.

427
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,100
Read your Bible, pray every day, and you'll do what?

428
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:39,500
Grow, grow, grow, right?

429
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,700
It's absolutely imperative.

430
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,339
It is a, it's a daily discipline when we read God's word.

431
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:50,980
Not only do we read it, if we love God's word, we ought to be reading God's word.

432
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,700
The evidence to support the claim.

433
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,220
If we love God's word, we ought to be studying God's word.

434
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,140
I believe there's a difference between reading and studying.

435
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,500
I believe that as you look at the scriptures, that you'll find that we're to read the Bible,

436
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,339
but every time that I read the Bible, every time that you read the Bible, you may not

437
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,459
have opportunity to study the Bible at that very time.

438
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,820
But how are we studying the Bible?

439
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,420
Is there some time in our week, in our schedule that we've set aside for some Bible study

440
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,100
where we're going to dig deeper than just reading?

441
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,739
And one of the aids that I think is so important is that while you're reading, that you keep

442
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:32,420
a notebook or you keep something where you can jot down, hey, I want to go back and look

443
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
at this.

444
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,739
I want to go back and find out more about this.

445
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,500
What happened in this city?

446
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,820
Who are these people?

447
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
What's going on?

448
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
So on and so forth.

449
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,119
And we're going to dig deeper, maybe a connection, no scriptures of any private interpretation.

450
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,600
We interpret scripture with scripture and it requires study.

451
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,160
Can I tell you that study is work?

452
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,040
Study is work.

453
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Takes work.

454
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
It takes commitment.

455
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
It takes dedication.

456
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,279
It takes time.

457
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,200
But we find that the Bible says in a verse that we're most of us are familiar with, study

458
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,239
in 2 Timothy 2 and verse 15, to show thyself a proven to God, a workman that needeth not

459
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,520
to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

460
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,160
If you're not reading and studying your Bible, you know what's going to happen, you'll believe

461
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:23,800
a lie, false teachers, you listen to something on the internet, some YouTube channel, some

462
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,279
internet preacher, and you've not read and studied and you're not grounded in the truth

463
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,280
of God's word, start believing crazy things.

464
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,359
Seriously.

465
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,359
Happens all the time.

466
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,119
People say, what do you think about this?

467
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,359
Where did you get that idea?

468
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,239
Because you didn't get that idea from reading the Bible.

469
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:46,119
You got that idea from watching something online, watching something, and you try to

470
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,440
read it into the Bible.

471
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
But if you're reading the Bible, studying the Bible, oh, it's so important.

472
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,559
The psalmist says, I love God's word.

473
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,080
We must read it.

474
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
We must study it.

475
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,400
Can I say this evening we should memorize it?

476
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,239
I know that I mentioned this morning, I did on Wednesday as well, the importance of memorizing.

477
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:13,119
We have verses each month that we have given you to try to encourage you to memorize God's

478
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,119
word.

479
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,840
And oftentimes I think it's a misunderstanding or misconception that we have in our churches

480
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,960
that we think Bible memorization is for children.

481
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,919
We kind of have this idea that you get a memory verse on Sunday school and it's kind of for

482
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,160
the children.

483
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,720
And Joseph gave all the little kids today from Sunday school, gave them a memory verse

484
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,440
that they were going to work on this week.

485
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,080
And Holly gives the kids memory verses on Wednesday night in their class.

486
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
I think it's wonderful.

487
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,440
The Children's Church, Junior Church, Jennifer and Lena, the kids will come up here and they'll

488
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,559
give us some verses that they've memorized.

489
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,280
They'll sing some songs.

490
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,760
But we are to memorize God's word.

491
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,200
Hide God's word in our hearts.

492
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,440
Bible memorization requires…

493
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,480
requires labor. As some often will say, well, you just can memorize things better. You just

494
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:13,060
have a better mind. It just requires work. It requires work, commitment, dedication.

495
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:19,300
Take one verse a month, a week, however you do it, and just work on memorizing that verse,

496
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,420
hiding God's Word. Listen, it's a truth that God gives us throughout His Word, wherewithal

497
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,300
shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy Word. Thy Word

498
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,780
have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee, in Psalm 119 verses 9 and

499
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,340
11. But the Lord Jesus Christ, when He was tempted, He's led of the spirit into the wilderness

500
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:45,420
and the enemy, Satan, comes and tempts. And in each of those accounts He says, it is written.

501
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,720
What a great pattern for us this evening to understand that we can't say it is written

502
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,960
if we don't have Scripture memorized in our heart. At that moment of temptation, at that

503
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,960
moment of difficulty of trial, that we have God's Word memorized, that we can immediately

504
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,560
recite it and rehearse it and be able to use the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word

505
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:14,480
of God, in order to combat our enemy. Oh, we need to know, memorize God's Word. Yes,

506
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,440
it's work. Yes, it's labor. But I want to encourage you this evening to memorize God's

507
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,080
Word. Someone wrote, I don't remember if it was Harlan Popov or someone else, but they

508
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,480
posed the question this way. If someone took your Bible away, and I know that's a hard

509
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,200
thing for us to think about, but I want you to know there's many people groups that have

510
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,920
had that happen. Many people groups, they come in and they confiscate all the Bibles.

511
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,400
Why do they do that? Because they know the power of this book. They do. Take all the

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Bibles away. The question was this, if someone took your Bible away, how much Bible would

513
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,639
you still have? If someone took your Bible away, how much Bible would you still have?

514
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,600
While I was in Bible college, there was a, I think it was only one or two years that

515
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,440
I was there that they had it, but they had an old style camp meeting. It was a thing

516
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,040
called Camp Glory, Camp Glory. And Holly, when she was younger, her church would come

517
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,600
over and participate in that. It was, put a big tent out and had this Camp Glory. And

518
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,720
I remember all the sound equipment would be under there. And so as a college student,

519
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,839
they asked some of us on one of the evenings if we'd sleep under the tent so that there'd

520
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,800
be some people there to protect all of the valuable equipment with all the sound equipment

521
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,839
and what have you. And I remember at the time, Holly and I weren't married, I was in college,

522
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,919
but some of her brothers and myself and a couple of other college students, we slept

523
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,080
under the tent that night. And for a couple of hours, we just quoted scripture. And here's

524
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,559
how we do it. There's like six of us and they'd have to memorize and quote, rehearse

525
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,680
a verse. And then the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person,

526
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,160
just kind of go right in a circle. And just how many verses could we quote? How many verses

527
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,320
had we hid in our hearts? And you'd be laying there and you've already quoted five, six,

528
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,760
seven, however many verses. And you're trying to think of the next one you're going to say.

529
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,760
And then two people before you said it and you said, no, that was the one I was going

530
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,279
to say. Right. And you're trying to think about the verses, but, but hiding God's word

531
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,680
in our hearts. If we love God's word, you know, it's amazing to me. There's some people

532
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,800
that you can talk to that can tell you all kinds of statistics about all kinds of things.

533
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,180
They can rattle off sports information. They can tell you about all of these statistics

534
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:34,279
and so on and so forth. That stuff is going to matter nothing in eternity. But then you

535
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,520
challenge them to memorize a verse of scripture. Well, I just don't have a good memory. I just

536
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,199
can't do it. Are you kidding me? You know all of this stuff about all these other things,

537
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:46,880
but you can't. And it's just a, if I love God's word, if you love God's word, we're

538
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,559
going to be memorizing it. We talked about reading it and studying it, memorizing it.

539
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,520
The Psalmist said in Psalm 119, it is my meditation. Oh, how love I thy law. It is my meditation

540
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,600
all the day. I preached a message years ago from Psalm 119. Actually, it was a Sunday

541
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,040
school class that I taught that we need to get to the place where we think and act biblically.

542
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:21,040
To think and act biblically. That we have so much of God's word in us that it impacts

543
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,119
our thoughts, it impacts our behavior, and we begin to think and act biblically. When

544
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,799
someone asks you a question, I mean, without giving much thought to it, you're immediately

545
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:36,540
thinking about a Bible principle that you could give as an answer. When you're, I say

546
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,839
this to guys as I try to help them with preparing messages, and you know it, those of you that

547
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,480
have been here for any length of time, almost every illustration that I use with the Bible,

548
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,799
I try to use a Bible illustration. Go to a Bible passage that gives us and illustrates

549
00:34:54,799 --> 00:35:01,720
that truth that we're working with. Why? Because the Bible is full of it. It has so much rich

550
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,600
information for us where we can see, here's a Bible principle, but here's how it applied.

551
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,799
Here's how they used the Bible principle, or here's how they did not apply the Bible

552
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:18,080
principle, and here's what happened. Begin to think and act biblically. Why? Because

553
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,559
we're saturating our minds with the Bible. We're reading it. We're studying it. We're

554
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:28,000
memorizing it. It's on my mind throughout the day. And then I would say this, finally

555
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
this evening as we wrap up, if I love God's Word, I'm going to talk about it. I'm going

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,480
to share it with others. I'm going to share the truth of God's Word with others. And

557
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,119
it doesn't have to be something that's forced. It doesn't have to be something that is any

558
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,519
type of manipulation. No, it's just going to come natural. Why? Because it's so much

559
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,720
in me that it's just the overflow. But I want to talk about the Bible. And the reality this

560
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,679
evening is that you study throughout the pages of Scripture, you look at the Apostle

561
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,440
Paul, and I understand that as he's ministering there, and God used him to write so much of

562
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,320
our New Testament from a human perspective, but we find this evening that we as the people

563
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,040
of God, we need to be sharing the truth of God's Word. And if I love God's Word, I'm

564
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,559
going to talk about God's Word. How do I know that? Because you talk about what you love.

565
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,160
You talk about what you love. You meet somebody that you've never met before, and you talk

566
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,279
to them for a little while, and you can find out their likes, their dislikes, their loves.

567
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:39,640
You can find out their interests. Why? Because they talk about what they love. You ever meet

568
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,519
somebody that's all about cars? They're talking about cars, and they're just, I didn't look

569
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,080
at you, Ron, for that purpose. Sorry. But you're looking, and you're just talking about,

570
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:56,559
but it's, they, we understand it. But I wonder this evening, how often when we as God's people

571
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:04,160
just kind of are having fellowship, how often do we talk about God's Word? Like, just naturally.

572
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,360
Just when's the last time you said to someone, or maybe someone said to you, hey, what's

573
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:17,519
God teaching you from His Word? And the fact that we wouldn't be fearful of someone asking

574
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:25,080
us that question, that we are spending so much time in God's Word, that daily we're

575
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,320
in the Bible because we love it. We say, oh, how love I thy law, that I'm not afraid of

576
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,600
someone asking me, hey, what's God teaching you in His, from His Word? What did you read

577
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,799
today? What are you studying? What are you learning? What is God revealing? We shouldn't

578
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:48,880
have to be afraid of that question if we love God's Word. This evening I would submit

579
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,279
to you, as Bible-believing Christians, that we ought to echo the words of the psalmist

580
00:37:54,279 --> 00:38:03,880
and say, oh, how love I thy law. But there ought to be evidences in our lives that would

581
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:11,200
support the claim. Really, you say that you love God's Word? Does the evidence support

582
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:19,119
it? We're to inspect and examine ourselves, not someone else. We'll examine our own hearts.

583
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,559
How's my Bible reading? As you think about that this evening, just ask yourself, how's

584
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,959
my Bible reading? I've told you before, there's times that I go to read my Bible and I'm distracted.

585
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:33,720
You say, oh, you're the pastor. I'm a human being. There are times I go to read my Bible

586
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,799
and I'm distracted. I'll read a chapter, two, maybe three, and I'm like, I have no

587
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:43,080
idea what I just read. I'm distracted. So you know what I do? I've told you before,

588
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,760
from this pulpit what I do. I go back and I start over and I pray, God, help me to not

589
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,960
be distracted. Eliminate those distractions. Help me to be focused. Why? Because this is

590
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,559
your Word and you have something for me. And I want to get what you have for me because

591
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,960
I need it. We come to the place where we say, listen, how's my Bible reading? When's

592
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,679
the last time I shared something from God's Word with someone else? I mean, not forced

593
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,880
to, but just because it's got to come out, it's the overflow. Like it's just, I want

594
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,840
to talk about it. And that's why I see the psalmist, oh, how love I thy law. I hope this

595
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,640
evening that each of us would say, I love God's Word. And then we'd examine ourselves

596
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,840
and see if the evidence supports the claim. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you

597
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,919
for loving us. It's a joy to have the Bible. It's a joy this evening to know that you've

598
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:51,919
given us the opportunity to put together scriptures, John and Romans, these last couple of days.

599
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:57,919
It's a labor of love. It's a labor.

600
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:04,319
Because we know the power of Your Word. We know that it's profitable. Being born again

601
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,439
not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth

602
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:19,159
forever. God, I pray that You would help us to love Your Word. And I pray that the evidences

603
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:26,919
would be in our lives that as we examine ourselves, Lord, You'd help us to read and study and

604
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:37,519
memorize and meditate and share Your Word. Help it to be fresh. Lord, give us revival.

605
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,519
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only You can and we'll thank

606
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,639
You for it in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with us?
