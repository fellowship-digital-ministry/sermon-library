WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
this morning, and I am thankful for this Book of Colossians. Of course, we started

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.560
2021 by preaching through the Book of Colossians, and we took a couple of

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.960
months off dealing with some other subject matters and have returned to the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.479
Book of Colossians here over the last few weeks, and I'm thankful for the truth

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:25.360
that we have here in this short little book, only four chapters, but it's

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.760
powerful and it's helpful, and as we enter into this third chapter of the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.439
Book of Colossians, really the second half of the book, we find that the Book

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:40.439
of Colossians is going to become more practical in nature. We find that really

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.720
it's a very similar type of a pattern or outline, if you will, to the Book of

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.479
Ephesians, where the first several chapters are more doctrinal in nature

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.799
and the last part is more practical in nature, and so we find that to be the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.599
case here in the Book of Colossians as well. We know that the Apostle Paul did

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:02.479
not personally know the believers in Colossae. However, he heard about their

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.199
testimony, and he had received word, the Bible tells us in the first chapter, how

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:12.319
that he received word from Epaphras with regard to these believers in the city of

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.480
Colossae and how God was using them, and we find that the Apostle Paul says that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.480
he was thankful for these believers, and he desired to impart truth to these

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.440
believers, he desired that they would grow spiritually. We find that in the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.319
first chapter of the Book of Colossians that the Apostle Paul says to these

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.160
believers in Colossae that he's praying for them, and then he tells them

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.440
specifically how he is praying for them, and when you read through chapter number

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.680
1 in verses 9 through 14 and really read of the way in which Paul is praying for

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.599
these believers in Colossae, we find that Paul had a love for these

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.839
believers, and he had a great desire that he would have the opportunity to impart

00:01:54.839 --> 00:02:00.480
truth to these believers so that they could stand on truth, so that they could

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.360
not fall prey to the enemy. We find that, as we've mentioned throughout the study

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.600
of the Book of Colossians, that the false teachers were active, and the false

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.679
teachers continue to be active today. In fact, last Sunday morning, as we looked at

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:19.520
the message to finish up the second chapter, we dealt with the traps of false

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:24.880
teaching, and so the Apostle Paul desired for these believers to be able to avoid

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.839
the dangers of false teaching. I believe that these individual believers here in

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.479
Colossae, as they received this book, this letter that was written to them, and as

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.720
we find that Paul did not know them personally, nor did they know Paul

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.759
personally, but I believe that the book would cause them to rejoice, to have an

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:51.320
understanding that there was a spiritual leader, the Apostle Paul, who

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.039
was thankful for them. I mean, he genuinely was thanking God for these

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:02.880
believers, people that he never met, people that he may never meet, of course,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.839
on earth. We know that as we look at the history and the life of Paul, it seems

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.759
that many of these believers, probably a majority of them, he never met face to

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.160
face, but he was thankful for them with a genuine appreciation and thankfulness

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.320
for their testimony, for their salvation, for their service to God. We find that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.559
not only was he thankful for them, but he prayed for them. You know it's a blessing

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:32.160
that someone would pray for you, that you would pray for someone else. We dealt

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.839
with the subject matter of intercessory prayer, that we can go to God on the

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:40.080
behalf of others, and what a great ministry is the people of God to be able

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.960
to intercede on the behalf of our brothers and sisters in Christ. And many

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.639
of the missionaries that we have, that we support, some of them we have met, some of

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.240
them you have not met them, you do not know them personally, but yet you can

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.759
pray for them. What a blessing. And you think about some of the individuals, even

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:04.119
as we know some of the missionaries, but then you find that there are people

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.839
within their churches, within their influence, that we've not met, but yet

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.800
they say, would you pray for this person? Would you pray for that person? I sent a

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.440
note to a preacher friend this morning that's planting a church in Delaware, and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.640
I said, hey brother, I just want to let you know I'm praying for you this

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.559
morning. I trust you guys have wonderful services, that the Lord is honored and

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.359
glorified, and preached the word. Just tried to encourage him a little bit, and

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:29.839
he replied back, and he said, we have a man getting baptized this morning, and

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:34.239
his unsaved girlfriend is gonna be here. Would you pray for her? And I said,

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:37.959
brother, I'm gonna stop right now and pray for her, and I did. And he sent me her

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.519
name. Her name is Vanessa, and I prayed this morning that Vanessa's heart would

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:45.239
be prepared, that as they entered into the service, that she would trust Christ

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:50.320
as her Savior. She heard the gospel. I'm not sure. I don't know who this person is.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.480
I don't know her from anyone, but I prayed for this morning. And we can pray

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.959
for people. I mean, think about the believers in Colossae. What a blessing to

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:02.000
know that Paul was thankful for them, that Paul was praying for them. He taught

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.000
them. He warned them. I know that oftentimes we don't like warnings. We

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.160
would rather not be warned, but the reality is that warnings are good for us,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.079
and we have come accustomed to what it is to live in a world full of warnings.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:22.559
You go and you look at many of the items in your house, especially cleaning items,

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.920
you'll find there are a number of warnings on the back of those products

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.880
that tell you how to use and how not to use that particular product. But the word

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.359
of God also has warnings for us. Those warnings are good, by the way. They're

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:41.079
beneficial for us, and we ought to thank God for them. We find that, I would say

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:45.000
this, that spiritual leaders, one of the responsibilities that we see, that we find

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.559
in the book of Hebrews, is that a spiritual leader is to watch for the

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:54.959
souls of the people. And part of that includes not only praying for them and

00:05:54.959 --> 00:06:00.559
teaching them and warning them, loving them. And I just, as I enter into the

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.720
third chapter of the book of Colossians and just think about what we've been

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.559
able to study thus far, and now as we enter into the practical nature of this

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:12.320
particular book, I find that it's worthwhile for us to just pause for a

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.880
moment and rejoice, as I believe the believers in Colossae would rejoice in

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.200
knowing what a blessing it was to have a spiritual leader that was engaged in

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.679
these particular ministries. As we enter into the third chapter, we find the Bible

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.000
begins in verse number one,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.320
"...if ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.559
sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:50.799
things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." Just

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:53.920
look at these first three verses this morning, and you notice the phrase in

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.760
verse number one, "...if ye then be risen with Christ." I've simply titled the

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.440
message this morning, Risen with Christ. As we look at these few verses of

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.600
Scripture, I'd like for us, first of all, if you're taking notes, to be mindful of

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.640
our position. To be mindful of our position. As we find that the Apostle

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.880
Paul is writing to these believers, remember it was in Colossians 1 and

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.519
verse number 2 that he says to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.480
which are at Colossae. We find that Paul was writing to individuals that were

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.799
saved, these people he refers to them as being saints and faithful brethren in

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:37.279
Christ, which are at Colossae. A saint is one who has trusted the Lord Jesus

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:42.200
Christ as their personal Savior, one that would have confidence, assurance that

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.600
heaven is their home, not because anything that they've done, but because

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.799
of what Jesus Christ did for them on the cross of Calvary. We find that Paul was

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:54.799
rejoicing in their salvation, as he mentions in the first several verses of

00:07:54.799 --> 00:08:00.820
Colossians 1, and as we enter into the third chapter, and he says if, and really

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.760
we find that the word if throughout the Scriptures can carry with it that idea

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.799
of since. It's not if, as in if this happens or if that happens, but it also

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:19.000
carries the idea, the thought of since. So think about this, if ye then be risen

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.359
with Christ, since you are saved, being mindful of your position in Christ, and

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:30.239
as we think about this particular verse of Scripture to begin, verse number one,

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:35.640
we find that Paul is really trying to encourage these believers, and I believe

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.559
for us this morning we are being encouraged to be mindful of our position.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:46.039
You know, the reality is that the greatest way of identifying ourselves is

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:50.679
to say that we are followers of Jesus Christ. I mean, what a great identifier,

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:55.880
what a great thing for us to understand and know our position in Christ, that we

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.440
are risen with Christ, if ye then be risen with Christ, and so we know that we

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.440
were dead in our sins, in our trespasses, were we not? We understand that Paul

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.960
dealt with that in verse number 13 of chapter number 2, and says, and you being

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.840
dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.119
quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses? And we find

00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:27.200
that we were dead in our sins and our trespasses, but as we consider our

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.000
position in Christ and we're mindful of the very truth that now we are risen

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.119
with Christ. Isn't that wonderful? We are risen with Christ, and as we think about

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:43.440
our position, now remember, he's dealt with in the last section of chapter

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.880
number 2, the warnings with regard to the traps of these false teachers, and

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.760
thinking about these false teachers, and we looked at some of the truth in the

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.200
book of Galatians last week as well, where we don't want to be entangled with

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.359
that bondage. Listen, we're complete in him, we are

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:04.319
We are risen with Christ,

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:06.239
and we're mindful of that position.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.319
Hold your place in the book of Colossians

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:10.519
and turn to the Gospel of John, if you will,

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:13.639
the first chapter, John 1.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:15.999
In John 1, we are familiar

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:19.279
with the first few verses of this book

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.239
and just the great way in which it begins

00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:25.479
and teaches us the truth of the deity

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.159
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.679
And John 1 beginning in verse 1 says,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.719
in the beginning was the Word,

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:33.239
and the Word was with God,

00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:34.759
and the Word was God.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.679
The same was in the beginning with God.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:39.039
All things were made by Him.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.919
And without Him was not anything made

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.759
that was made.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:43.719
But notice verse 4.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:46.599
In Him was life,

00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:50.039
and the life was the light of men.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.119
You understand that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.399
gave us life.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.319
We find that here, He says in Him was life,

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:59.639
and the life was the light of men.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.439
And we understand that as we look at

00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:02.919
the truth of the Word of God,

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.959
that we are body, soul, and spirit.

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.399
And we understand that we were dead

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.999
in our sins and our trespasses.

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:10.519
But now, as we are risen with Christ,

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.639
He's given us life.

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.999
Notice what Jesus says in John 10.

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:20.159
Turn several pages over to John 10.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:22.119
And in this particular passage of Scripture,

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:23.879
we're just going to look at one verse

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:24.959
in verse 10.

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:28.039
But you'll find that it's a great chapter

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:31.399
dealing with the fact that He is the Good Shepherd.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.999
And He is.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.119
And He mentions in this text of Scripture

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:38.159
how that He gives His life for the sheep.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:40.759
But notice in verse 10 of John 10,

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.559
the Bible says the thief cometh not,

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:45.519
but for to steal, and to kill,

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:47.959
and to destroy.

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:49.519
What does Jesus say?

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:53.079
I am come that they might have life,

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.479
and that they might have it more abundantly.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.639
Isn't that wonderful?

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:01.119
Listen, we can live the abundant life

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:03.599
because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:04.959
on the cross of Calvary.

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.999
Because we are risen with Christ,

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.199
we can have that abundant life.

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:11.559
Listen, I'm thankful for the teaching

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.359
and the truth of eternal life.

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:15.279
And I'm thankful that one day,

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:18.279
I will spend eternity in heaven with my Savior.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.399
But the reality is that as long as

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.879
the Lord keeps us here upon this earth,

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:25.319
we must be mindful of our position in Him

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:27.679
and we must understand that He's given us life

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.159
and that we can have the abundant life.

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:32.839
We don't have to live under the circumstances.

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.399
We don't have to have a woe is me

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:37.239
type of an outlook on life.

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:39.759
We understand that we are risen with Christ.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.919
I am a child of the King.

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:43.399
I'm going to heaven.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:44.239
Amen?

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:45.079
Can't wait.

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:46.679
We sing that song with kids.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.719
Someone walked in this morning and said,

00:12:48.719 --> 00:12:50.799
Pastor, if my heart stops, don't worry,

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:53.119
don't call anyone, just let me go to heaven.

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:53.959
Amen?

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:58.839
The reality is that heaven is a wonderful place.

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:01.359
And yes, we're headed there,

00:13:01.359 --> 00:13:03.799
but at this particular time in our lives,

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.279
we're here upon this earth

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:09.279
and we have the ability God said He's given us life

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:13.039
and He's given us it more abundantly.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:14.719
Now notice this when we consider back

00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:17.719
to the book of Colossians in chapter number three,

00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:19.999
we notice in verse number one, the first phrase,

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.879
if ye then be risen with Christ.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:25.079
And so as we're mindful of our position,

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:26.839
we say that we're risen with Christ.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:29.199
We are, He gave us life.

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:32.319
But then notice what He says in verse number three.

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:37.319
For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.839
And you say, well, is there a contradiction?

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.999
No, there's no contradiction in the Word of God.

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:46.959
We find that here as He says in verse number three,

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.959
for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God,

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.959
we find that there's no contradiction

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.719
that really what He's telling us

00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:58.759
and as we'll look at another couple of passages

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:01.919
of Scripture here is that I am dead to self

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.079
and I am dead to the world.

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:05.839
I'm dead to sin.

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:07.239
Look over to the book of Romans, if you will,

00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:08.679
in chapter number six.

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:12.799
You know, the reality is that in Romans chapter number six,

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:15.359
Paul is giving this great discourse

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:18.559
with regard to the way in which we have been delivered

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.319
from the power of sin because of our salvation.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:25.199
And we find that here in Romans chapter number six,

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:27.679
he's giving this great teaching

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:31.000
with regard to yielding ourselves unto God.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.239
And, you know, you become the servant

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:36.119
of whoever you yield yourself to.

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:38.079
And we find here in Romans chapter number six,

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:41.199
look in verse number 11, if you will, it says this.

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:45.439
Likewise, reckon ye also yourselves

00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:49.639
to be dead indeed unto sin,

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:53.599
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:54.679
Now think about this.

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:59.159
Prior to salvation, I was bound by sin, right?

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:02.319
We talk about sinners and we say that we understand

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:05.479
that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:08.039
By the way, that's not a very popular teaching today.

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.839
By the way, a lot of these large churches today,

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:14.479
they're skipping over the whole idea of being a sinner

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.559
and the whole truth of needing to have repentance.

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:20.119
And they're just teaching and saying God loves you

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.679
and God accepts you as you are and so on and so forth.

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.079
And I'm thankful that God loves us,

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:27.959
but the reality is that He's a holy God

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:30.479
and we must acknowledge that we're sinners

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:32.759
or we're never gonna need a Savior.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.719
Amen?

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:36.599
Why do I need a Savior if I'm not a sinner?

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:40.000
All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.439
I've had people as we've left door hangers

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:43.919
and literature upon their doors,

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:45.879
I've had people call the church

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.959
and tell me how unkind it was

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.639
for us to tell them that they're sinners

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:51.279
and then they go into some tirade,

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.079
listening all sorts of filthy language

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.399
as to how they're not a sinner.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.559
And I'm like, well, you've just kind of proven

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.319
the case against yourself, amen?

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:04.079
But the reality is that, listen, we're all sinners.

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.159
And I was bound by sin.

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:09.239
Notice verse number 14 here, Romans 6,

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:11.559
for sin shall not have dominion over you

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:12.919
for you're not under the law but under grace.

00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:14.799
But the reality is that prior to salvation,

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.719
sin did have dominion over me.

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:21.000
It was not just a thing of needing

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
some reformation in my life

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.199
or you needing some reformation in your life.

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.879
We needed to be transformed.

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:29.159
We needed to be born again.

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:30.000
Why?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.399
Because we were dead in our sins and our trespasses

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:35.239
and sin had dominion over us.

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:38.759
But now in Christ, because I've been made alive,

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:42.359
we find that now the teaching of God's Word

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:46.319
is that we now are to reckon ourselves

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:51.319
to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.839
We sing a song this week.

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.359
We sang it several times this week.

00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:58.439
In fact, I said on Wednesday when we sang the song

00:16:58.439 --> 00:17:00.199
that maybe we should do it Wednesday evening.

00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:02.759
It'd be a great opportunity for our church family

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.439
to get involved with singing some of these

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:06.479
great vacation Bible school songs.

00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:08.039
And we skipped it.

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:09.839
It would have been quite interesting for sure.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.279
But the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:13.119
Why?

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.159
Because there's been a great change

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.799
since I've been born again.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:22.799
I've reckoned myself dead unto sin but alive unto God.

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:28.199
I think about what Paul said in Galatians 2.

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:31.719
Turn over if you will to that great passage of Scripture.

00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:34.199
Many of us are familiar and in fact could quote

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:36.639
this verse of Scripture here in Galatians 2

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.119
in verse number 20.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:44.039
When the Apostle Paul says I am crucified with Christ.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.959
Nevertheless, I live.

00:17:49.959 --> 00:17:53.639
Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:56.519
And the life which I now live in the flesh,

00:17:56.519 --> 00:18:00.519
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:03.679
and gave himself for me.

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:08.439
So we find that these believers in Colossians,

00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:11.559
we find for us this morning that we need to be mindful

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:13.359
of our position in Christ.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:16.000
We need to be mindful of the truth that we've had

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.519
as our theme this year, complete in Christ

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:21.319
that he says in Colossians 2 in verse number 10

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:23.519
for you're complete in him.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:27.359
And I am to be, as I recognize my position,

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:30.519
I am risen with Christ and at the very same time,

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:34.199
I am dead according to what he says in verse number three

00:18:34.199 --> 00:18:36.880
for you're dead and your life is hid with Christ and God.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.880
I'm alive unto God, but I've reckoned myself dead unto sin.

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:46.799
Now think about this position that we have in Christ.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.799
You know that we are in the world,

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.919
but we are not of the world.

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:53.519
John chapter number 17 teaches us that truth

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.719
is the Lord Jesus Christ is praying

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.359
before he would go to the cross of Calvary.

00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:02.000
He speaks about the position of the believers

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.959
and the fact that we're in the world,

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:05.440
but we're not of the world.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.479
We find that the Bible says in verse number 14 of John 17,

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:12.479
I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them

00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:14.640
because they are not of the world,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.919
even as I am not of the world.

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:20.479
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,

00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:24.679
but thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:27.839
We're in the world, but we're not of the world.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:32.839
You find that after conversion,

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:35.479
after you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:36.719
as your personal Savior,

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:38.839
and you begin to walk with God,

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:42.079
and you begin to seek to serve God,

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:45.279
and all of a sudden, that crowd of individuals

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:47.440
that you used to hang around with,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.239
there's not as many things in common with them anymore.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.440
Why? Because the things you used to do,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.839
you're not able to find the same level of pleasure

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:00.799
in those things anymore, because you've been born again.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.399
The Bible says, therefore, if any man be in Christ.

00:20:03.399 --> 00:20:05.299
He's a new creature.

00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:06.779
Old things are passed away.

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:09.559
Behold, all things are become new.

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:11.919
And we find as we're mindful this morning

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.559
of our position in Christ

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:14.959
that we are in the world,

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:16.299
but we're not of the world.

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.179
I'm mindful of what the book of Hebrews

00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:20.619
teaches us that we are strangers

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:22.599
and pilgrims.

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:24.639
What a great terminology that is used there

00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:25.739
in Hebrews 11.

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:27.599
If you want to jot the reference down,

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:30.399
you can look at v. 13-16 there in Hebrews 11,

00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:32.999
and you can find how that there

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:34.739
as we would consider the great

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:36.659
hall of faith chapter

00:20:36.659 --> 00:20:39.299
that in summary in those few verses

00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:40.939
he speaks about the fact that we are

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.539
strangers and pilgrims.

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:45.939
The reality is that we're not home,

00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:48.299
but we're heading home.

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.299
You've heard the song,

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:51.619
this world is not my home,

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:54.379
I'm just a passing through.

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.379
Right?

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.659
And we find that we are pilgrims.

00:20:57.659 --> 00:21:00.859
We are strangers and pilgrims.

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:05.119
This position that we have in Christ,

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.999
we are His ambassadors.

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.359
An ambassador by the very definition

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:12.719
is one that goes to another place

00:21:12.719 --> 00:21:16.059
representing the place from which He is sent.

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:17.919
We find that we have ambassadors

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:19.159
from the United States that go to

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:21.239
various countries around the world.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.519
They have U.S. citizenship

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:25.119
and they are going to some other country

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:28.119
to represent the affairs of the United States

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:30.039
in that particular country.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.059
In fact, we have some ambassadors

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:33.499
from other countries that are here

00:21:33.499 --> 00:21:35.059
in our country.

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:36.099
And they're doing the same thing

00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:37.339
that our ambassadors are doing

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:38.819
in their countries.

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:40.379
And we find that here

00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:42.499
in 2 Corinthians 5

00:21:42.499 --> 00:21:45.339
that God says that we as the people of God

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:49.779
that we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:51.779
My citizenship is in heaven.

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:52.779
Amen?

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:53.779
There's some people on earth

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.059
that have dual citizenship

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:56.259
meaning that they are citizens

00:21:56.259 --> 00:21:58.019
of two countries.

00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:59.499
And I would say as a believer

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.279
that I have dual citizenship.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.199
My citizenship is in heaven

00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:05.719
and I'm a citizen of the United States of America

00:22:05.719 --> 00:22:09.399
but I'm more thankful for my citizenship in heaven.

00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:10.239
Amen?

00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:11.359
I'm thankful to be a citizen

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:12.359
of the United States of America

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:14.799
but man, how important it is to know

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.439
that I'm a citizen of heaven.

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:18.659
That I'm going to heaven.

00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:20.999
My position in Christ.

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:22.799
See, sometimes in life

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:25.839
we can get to a place

00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:28.659
where we're not mindful

00:22:28.659 --> 00:22:31.459
of what our position is in Christ.

00:22:31.459 --> 00:22:32.459
We get so beat up

00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:33.619
and so bogged down

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:34.979
with the world in which we're living

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.699
and we get so influenced

00:22:36.699 --> 00:22:38.139
by the things in which we hear

00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:39.259
and the things in which we see

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:41.259
and all that's going on

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:44.699
and we can lose focus

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:47.779
of our position in Christ.

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:49.819
And how vital it is

00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:51.699
that we are mindful

00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:53.419
of our position in Christ.

00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:55.399
I'm a child of the King.

00:22:56.399 --> 00:22:57.839
I'm a child of the King.

00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.839
I mean, that's a wonderful,

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:02.719
wonderful truth of the Word of God.

00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:04.719
The truth of the citizenship

00:23:04.719 --> 00:23:06.039
that we have in heaven.

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:07.399
Philippians chapter number three

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:08.279
and verse number 20

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:09.759
if you want to jot the reference down

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:13.199
it talks about our conversation is in heaven

00:23:13.199 --> 00:23:15.159
and the very root word of that Greek word

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:16.759
that is translated in our English Bibles

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:20.199
is conversation means to be a citizen.

00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:21.599
To be a citizen.

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:25.219
Our conversation, our citizenship is in heaven.

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:28.459
Paul then says to those believers in Philippi

00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:29.899
as he enters into the fourth chapter

00:23:29.899 --> 00:23:30.899
of the book of Philippians

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:33.939
about the reality of having their names written

00:23:33.939 --> 00:23:36.059
in the book of life.

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:36.959
What a joy.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:40.059
In fact, the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:41.359
reminded the disciples

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:42.979
when they came back rejoicing

00:23:42.979 --> 00:23:45.899
that the spirits were subject unto them.

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:46.819
There in the book of Luke

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:49.079
he says, listen, in that rejoice not

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:51.899
but rather rejoice that your names

00:23:51.899 --> 00:23:54.039
are written in heaven.

00:23:54.979 --> 00:23:55.819
We sing the song,

00:23:55.819 --> 00:23:59.059
there's a new name written down in glory

00:23:59.059 --> 00:24:01.199
and it's mine.

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:03.239
Oh yes, it's mine.

00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:05.179
I understand that when we come to church

00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:06.499
and we sing about heaven

00:24:06.499 --> 00:24:08.739
and we sing about our position in Christ,

00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:09.739
man, we get excited

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:12.699
and then we go and live in the world.

00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:14.899
We go and live in the world.

00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:18.979
And we sometimes can lose focus

00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:21.939
upon what our position is.

00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:23.519
It's interesting in John 17

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:25.639
where Jesus says that we're in the world

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:26.479
but not of the world

00:24:26.479 --> 00:24:27.719
when he says there that I pray not

00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:30.019
that thou wouldest take them out of the world

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:33.119
but that thou wouldest keep them from the evil.

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:35.079
No doubt many of us over the years

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:36.279
have had the thought,

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:39.439
I wish Jesus just go ahead and take me home.

00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:41.319
Just take me out of this world.

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:44.799
But he's got a purpose for us here.

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.559
He's got a purpose for us

00:24:46.579 --> 00:24:49.019
and it's to be his representatives.

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:52.139
And what a joy as we enter into the third chapter

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:53.739
of the book of Colossians

00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:57.419
to be reminded of our position in Christ.

00:24:57.419 --> 00:24:59.499
Number one is to be mindful of your position.

00:24:59.499 --> 00:25:03.199
Number two, if you're taking notes this morning,

00:25:03.199 --> 00:25:06.599
be mindful of your pursuits.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:08.899
Be mindful of your pursuits.

00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:10.959
What is it that we are pursuing?

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:14.359
We understand that as we live in this world,

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:16.039
we understand that we come into contact

00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:17.579
with a variety of people

00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:19.699
and we understand that we could easily come

00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:23.019
to the conclusion that everyone is pursuing something.

00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:26.119
People are pursuing things.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:29.979
And there's obviously a particular time

00:25:29.979 --> 00:25:31.619
in our nation's history

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:34.619
and it's not maybe talked about as often today

00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:36.019
but in which people will talk about

00:25:36.019 --> 00:25:38.679
pursuing the American dream.

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:40.859
No doubt you've heard that phraseology,

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:42.339
you've heard that idea

00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:44.859
and you understand the concepts

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:47.199
that are behind the statement

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.839
that is made of pursuing the American dream.

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:53.399
But the reality is that everyone is pursuing something.

00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:58.119
There are people that are pursuing fame, popularity.

00:25:59.719 --> 00:26:01.919
There are people that are pursuing position.

00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:05.159
How high of a position can I get?

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:07.659
Well, remember, we just talked about our position.

00:26:08.879 --> 00:26:10.279
Paul deals with the position

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.759
before he deals with the pursuits.

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:14.799
If my position is that I'm a child of God,

00:26:15.739 --> 00:26:17.459
that I am joint heirs with Jesus Christ,

00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:19.939
that I am a child of the King,

00:26:19.939 --> 00:26:21.459
that I am heaven-bound,

00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:24.699
that I am alive in Him,

00:26:24.699 --> 00:26:26.739
that He's given me life

00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:28.939
and He's given me it more abundantly,

00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:32.219
what higher position could I ever want?

00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:35.699
So he deals with the position

00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:37.899
before he deals with the pursuits.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:41.479
But there's some people that are pursuing a position, right?

00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:43.019
Well, we know people that are.

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:46.839
People that are pursuing pleasure.

00:26:47.959 --> 00:26:52.879
People that are pursuing things, possessions, right?

00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:56.039
And you think about the pursuit of a position.

00:26:56.039 --> 00:26:59.699
You think about the pursuit of a possession.

00:26:59.699 --> 00:27:02.919
You think about these pursuits of pleasure.

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:03.759
You know what they do?

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:05.479
They leave you empty.

00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:06.559
They leave you empty.

00:27:07.719 --> 00:27:08.999
Because you get to the position

00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:10.239
that you thought you wanted to get to

00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:12.259
and then you find out that there's

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:13.719
another rung on that ladder.

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:17.359
And there's a higher position.

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:19.519
Or you find out, I want to be the boss,

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:21.039
I want to be the boss, I want to be the boss.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:21.879
And then you become the boss

00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:24.639
and you find out I really don't want to be the boss.

00:27:24.639 --> 00:27:26.799
It's not really fun being the boss, right?

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.859
You understand what I'm saying?

00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:29.759
I had to talk to a manager yesterday

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:31.159
at a particular store I went to

00:27:31.159 --> 00:27:32.859
and the manager just wanted to hide in the back

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:34.639
and just send the little guy out.

00:27:34.639 --> 00:27:37.479
And I'm like, if you're the manager, come talk to me, man.

00:27:37.479 --> 00:27:39.919
Like, you got that position for a reason, right?

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:41.439
Don't just send the little guy out and say,

00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:43.259
I'm sorry, we can't do anything about it.

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:44.819
No, no, you can do something about it.

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:46.299
You understand what I'm saying?

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:48.579
Joseph was with me, that's what the guy said, right?

00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:51.039
And the reality, and I wasn't being mean,

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.619
I wasn't being unkind, just okay, that's fine,

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:54.579
I understand, just have your manager come out.

00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:55.739
And then he just wants to stay in the back room.

00:27:55.739 --> 00:27:57.259
It's like, should I come over there and talk to you?

00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:58.099
You know what I mean?

00:27:58.099 --> 00:27:59.699
So you get a position, you find out

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:01.539
that there's somebody that has a greater position

00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:03.339
or you get a position, you find out,

00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:06.099
you know what, I really didn't want this position after all.

00:28:07.099 --> 00:28:07.939
Right?

00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:10.899
Possessions.

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:12.519
What happens to possessions?

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.799
How many of you have ever bought a brand new car?

00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.799
We bought brand new cars.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.559
What happens to that brand new car?

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:24.259
Gets old.

00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:26.599
You ever get a door ding in your brand new car?

00:28:27.879 --> 00:28:30.079
What's it make you feel like?

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:34.279
Ugh, yeah, whoever made that noise, ugh, right?

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.499
But then you're driving around a Mr. Edge truck.

00:28:38.879 --> 00:28:40.439
What year is it, 1991?

00:28:41.639 --> 00:28:42.719
92?

00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:45.719
I don't even care if somebody gives me a door ding.

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:47.359
Right, like, what does it matter?

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.439
You understand what I'm saying?

00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:51.519
I'm not trying to park in the back of the parking lot

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:53.699
at Walmart so that no one's around me.

00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:55.559
How many of you guys park, you got a brand new car,

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:57.479
you're trying to make sure no one's around you?

00:28:57.479 --> 00:28:58.799
Right?

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.079
Amen.

00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:01.479
And then you come out and you're like,

00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:04.759
why did everyone park around my car?

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:06.439
Like, there was nobody, right?

00:29:06.439 --> 00:29:07.559
I mean, it's happened, right?

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:09.719
But what happens to possessions?

00:29:09.739 --> 00:29:12.379
They deteriorate, they get old.

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:15.479
They break down, right?

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:16.699
Pleasure.

00:29:16.699 --> 00:29:20.199
The Bible says that there's pleasure in sin for a season.

00:29:20.199 --> 00:29:23.039
We think about the sinful pursuits of pleasure.

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:27.679
And we understand that as we look here of our pursuits,

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:31.839
that it is vital that as the people of God,

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:35.919
that we pursue God, that we pursue the Lord.

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:38.799
Think about what the psalmist says in Psalm 42.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:42.399
In Psalm 42, it's a...

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:45.239
Actually, there's a song that goes along with it,

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:46.719
I will spare you,

00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:50.079
but many of you might be familiar with the song.

00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:52.599
But in Psalm 42, verses one and two,

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.559
notice what the Bible says here.

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:16.719
As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:30:16.719 --> 00:30:23.919
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:28.799
When shall I come and appear before God?

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:33.039
Lord of those that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.359
Is that not what Jesus said?

00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:38.919
I wonder, have you ever been thirsty?

00:30:38.919 --> 00:30:43.999
I'm sure we've been thirsty, but I wonder if spiritually speaking and looking at that

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:50.519
truth of Psalm 42, have we ever thirsted after God?

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:53.159
Like we just, we just, we want to pursue God.

00:30:53.159 --> 00:31:00.559
We just want to get in God's presence and want to enjoy understanding that in thy presence

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:04.039
is fullness of joy.

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:12.319
You understand that nothing, no thing on this earth will satisfy you like Jesus will satisfy

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.319
you.

00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:20.199
Listen, the world, they spend millions, billions of dollars on advertising.

00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:24.799
The marketing industry is a huge industry in this country, but in all the world, the

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:29.999
marketing industry is a huge industry and they're trying to market their products and

00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:34.719
as they market their products, they're seeking to tell you why you need what they're trying

00:31:34.719 --> 00:31:40.719
to sell and how, if you get what they're trying to sell, it's going to satisfy you.

00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:43.639
It's going to bring you some level of fulfillment.

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:47.959
It's going to bring you some satisfaction, but there is nothing upon this earth that

00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:51.559
will satisfy you like the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:53.479
Nothing.

00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:59.159
And these believers in Colossae, and for us this morning, as we're mindful of our position

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:04.119
and then we must be mindful of our pursuits, notice back in Colossians 3, the Bible begins

00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:09.999
in verse number 1, if ye then be risen with Christ, since we understand our position in

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:17.719
Christ, notice what he says, seek those things which are above.

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:24.399
And in case you don't know specifically what he's referring to, he says, where Christ sitteth

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:27.999
on the right hand of God.

00:32:27.999 --> 00:32:31.159
Seek those things which are eternal.

00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:34.479
Seek those things which really matter.

00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:39.779
To seek something.

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:48.499
We understand that that requires a level of energy to be exerted, to seek for something.

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:53.619
You've ever lost something and you're going to seek for that item that you have misplaced

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:56.219
or you've lost.

00:32:56.219 --> 00:33:00.959
And you're going to exert some energy in order to find that thing.

00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:03.539
Someone that's seeking for some hid treasure.

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:12.019
We find that many times not only do they exert energy, but they spend money.

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:17.739
Sometimes give their lives in the pursuit of some treasure.

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:23.059
But we're to seek the Word of God.

00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:24.219
Seek the Lord.

00:33:24.219 --> 00:33:30.339
As we go to the Scriptures, we're to seek in the Scriptures those things that He has

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:31.339
for us.

00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:33.979
And we find that it's more precious than rubies.

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:36.259
It's more precious than gold.

00:33:36.259 --> 00:33:37.619
It's more precious.

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:44.939
The truth of God's Word is more precious than any of those earthly things.

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:47.019
What did Jesus say in Matthew?

00:33:47.019 --> 00:33:51.939
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.

00:33:51.939 --> 00:33:55.899
And all these things shall be added unto you.

00:33:55.899 --> 00:33:59.219
Do you know that He knows what you need?

00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:01.019
He knows what I need.

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:03.499
He made us.

00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:09.419
Did God know that the children of Israel needed water when He led them out of Egypt?

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:10.779
Sure He did.

00:34:10.779 --> 00:34:12.459
He's God.

00:34:12.459 --> 00:34:13.579
He made us.

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:14.779
He formed us.

00:34:14.779 --> 00:34:18.899
He created us with a need for water.

00:34:18.899 --> 00:34:21.219
Did He know that they needed food?

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:23.739
Sure He did.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.899
And He provided, did He not?

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:28.019
He provided.

00:34:28.019 --> 00:34:30.579
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.

00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:36.779
So we find here in Colossians 3, in verse number 1, after the position has been given

00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:41.099
and understood, and we're mindful of that truth of what our position is, we're then

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:45.059
taught about our pursuits that we're to seek those things which are above, where Christ

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:46.939
sitteth on the right hand of God.

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:57.459
Notice verse number 2, set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

00:34:57.459 --> 00:35:02.859
I understand that there are some things that we need on earth.

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:03.859
Understand that.

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:08.219
But you understand that as He speaks here, set your affection on things above, not on

00:35:08.219 --> 00:35:12.379
things on the earth, I wonder if we could look at this verse from the perspective of

00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:17.659
understanding that as I have set my affection on those things above, not on things of the

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:22.419
earth, I could ask it this way, maybe present it this way, is there anything that you have

00:35:22.419 --> 00:35:29.299
possession wise that you're not willing to give up for God?

00:35:29.299 --> 00:35:33.739
That I've set my affection so much on some thing of the earth that I'm unwilling to

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:37.619
give that up for God.

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:42.739
If so, that thing becomes an idol, correct?

00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:51.259
We find this morning that when I understand my position, it really affects my pursuits,

00:35:51.259 --> 00:35:52.379
does it not?

00:35:52.379 --> 00:35:57.859
That I understand when I'm mindful of what my position is, it helps to guide me as to

00:35:57.859 --> 00:36:00.059
those things that I pursue.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:06.099
It helps me to understand, listen, if a lost man is seeking to establish some name for

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:10.299
himself and to set up some kingdom here upon the earth, you kind of understand that.

00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:14.139
He has nothing more to live for.

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:17.539
He who has the most toys wins, kind of an idea, right?

00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:22.659
But the reality is that if we've been born again and since we understand our position

00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:26.379
in Christ, remember Paul's not writing to lost people, he's writing to believers, he's

00:36:26.379 --> 00:36:31.419
writing to saints, those that have been born again here in the book of Colossae, in the

00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:37.619
city of Colossae, and we have this morning, if you've been born again, you understand

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:44.619
what your position is, then having a knowledge of your position will influence what you pursue.

00:36:44.659 --> 00:36:48.699
What am I pursuing in life?

00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:55.459
It's more about the treasure I can lay up in heaven than the toys I can possess here.

00:36:55.459 --> 00:36:57.019
It really is.

00:36:57.019 --> 00:36:59.899
Look at what Jesus said, turn to the book of Matthew if you will.

00:36:59.899 --> 00:37:06.899
We mentioned a passage of Scripture here in Matthew 6 earlier, near the end of the chapter

00:37:07.539 --> 00:37:12.619
verse 33, seek ye first the kingdom of God.

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:19.619
But I want you to notice what Jesus says prior to giving that instruction in Matthew 6 in

00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:25.299
verse number 19.

00:37:25.299 --> 00:37:28.939
Matthew 6 in verse number 19, the Lord Jesus Christ says,

00:37:28.939 --> 00:37:34.859
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:37.579
thieves break through and steal.

00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:42.739
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,

00:37:42.739 --> 00:37:45.939
and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:51.219
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:58.219
In our society today, there's much emphasis upon financial planning, retirement planning,

00:37:59.739 --> 00:38:06.139
so on and so forth, and certainly there's advantages to understanding those things and

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:08.819
preparing for those things.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:13.059
But the reality is that as the people of God, we ought to be concerned about some eternity

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:15.179
planning as well.

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:20.979
I'm not suggesting that you skip over entirely the idea of retirement planning, but if our

00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:25.979
emphasis is so much upon retirement planning that we forget about the eternity planning,

00:38:25.979 --> 00:38:31.819
we're in trouble, we're in trouble.

00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:37.259
And so we find here that as we consider the pursuits, and he says, set your affection

00:38:37.259 --> 00:38:41.819
on things above, not on things of the earth, turn over to 1 John chapter 2, and notice

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:46.419
what is said here in this passage of Scripture.

00:38:46.419 --> 00:38:52.499
And look, we find here this morning that again, and to be repetitive, to just get it in our

00:38:52.499 --> 00:38:59.499
minds, when I understand my position, it's going to influence what I pursue.

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:09.419
In 1 John chapter 2, remember the verse there in Colossians 3, and verse number 2 said,

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:13.819
set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth, on the earth.

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:20.819
Here in verse number 15 of 1 John chapter 2, it says this, love not the world, neither

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:24.339
the things that are in the world.

00:39:24.339 --> 00:39:27.739
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:31.139
Notice what he says, for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:37.179
of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:44.179
And then notice what it says in verse 17, and the world passeth away, and the lust thereof.

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:49.859
But he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever.

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:56.339
Again, I understand that we have things in this world, and I think the idea, as we look

00:39:56.339 --> 00:40:00.659
at Colossians 3 and verse number 2, and even as we look here at 1 John 2 and verses 15

00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:03.659
through 17, the question is, do you have something?

00:40:03.659 --> 00:40:07.959
that you value greater than God?

00:40:07.959 --> 00:40:10.159
Is there something that you're not willing

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:12.119
to give up for God?

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:15.259
You've got such a grip on whatever that thing is.

00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:16.939
You've set your affection on it.

00:40:16.939 --> 00:40:18.179
You're loving it.

00:40:18.179 --> 00:40:25.419
You're saying I'm unwilling to give this up for God.

00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:27.179
The Bible tells us as it says there

00:40:27.179 --> 00:40:28.939
in 1 John 2 and verse 17

00:40:28.939 --> 00:40:31.599
that the world passeth away.

00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:33.639
In 2 Peter 3, you don't need to turn there,

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:37.519
the Bible tells us that the world will be dissolved

00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:40.379
with a fervent heat.

00:40:40.379 --> 00:40:42.419
I remember my dad years ago,

00:40:42.419 --> 00:40:44.139
I haven't heard him say it recently

00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:45.859
but I remember hearing him say it often

00:40:45.859 --> 00:40:48.619
when I was still living at home.

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:49.939
He would talk about things and he'd say

00:40:49.939 --> 00:40:52.299
well it's all going to burn up one day anyway.

00:40:52.299 --> 00:40:55.379
It's all going to burn up one day anyway.

00:40:55.379 --> 00:40:58.179
And that was kind of his perspective

00:40:58.179 --> 00:40:59.179
and he understood that.

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:02.019
Again, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't have nice things

00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:03.539
or we can't have nice things.

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:06.959
I'm not suggesting that this morning.

00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:09.399
But what I'm suggesting is that as we look and understand

00:41:09.399 --> 00:41:11.359
what our position is in Christ,

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:13.759
it will have an impact upon our pursuits.

00:41:13.759 --> 00:41:17.159
What is it that these believers in Colossae were pursuing?

00:41:17.159 --> 00:41:19.759
What is it that Paul is trying to help them understand

00:41:19.759 --> 00:41:24.039
as he's encouraging them to be mindful of your position

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:27.679
and to be mindful of your pursuits?

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:30.559
Am I pursuing God?

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:35.299
I mean, number one priority, pursuing God.

00:41:35.299 --> 00:41:37.419
Pursuing the things of God.

00:41:37.419 --> 00:41:39.699
You know, what is it that would cause someone to,

00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:41.059
we talk about our missionaries

00:41:41.059 --> 00:41:43.379
and one of the things that Brother Michael said this morning

00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:45.179
when he was praying for the McKinley family

00:41:45.179 --> 00:41:49.539
is that they took their family and moved to another country.

00:41:49.539 --> 00:41:51.779
You know that several of the missionaries on that board,

00:41:51.779 --> 00:41:52.859
they didn't become missionaries

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:56.659
because they had nothing else that they could do in life.

00:41:56.659 --> 00:41:59.459
Yes, it's that God placed a call upon their lives,

00:41:59.479 --> 00:42:03.519
but they were willing to do whatever God wanted them to do.

00:42:03.519 --> 00:42:06.639
And they were willing to give up perhaps some position,

00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:10.639
perhaps some whatever in order to go and pursue God

00:42:10.639 --> 00:42:12.499
and do what God wanted them to do.

00:42:14.439 --> 00:42:15.479
Think about what Paul says.

00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:16.999
We'll close with this passage of Scripture

00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:19.639
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four.

00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:21.559
2 Corinthians chapter number four,

00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:23.799
I want you to see what Paul says here.

00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:30.799
Speaking of our pursuits,

00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:34.799
I'm rejoicing in my position.

00:42:34.799 --> 00:42:39.799
What a joy to know that I belong to Jesus.

00:42:39.799 --> 00:42:41.799
Amen?

00:42:41.799 --> 00:42:44.799
What a joy to know that heaven is our home.

00:42:44.799 --> 00:42:47.799
I'm being mindful of my pursuits.

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:50.799
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 4,

00:42:50.799 --> 00:42:53.799
in verse number 18,

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:58.799
while we look not at the things which are seen,

00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:01.799
but the things which are not seen.

00:43:01.799 --> 00:43:06.799
For the things which are seen are temporal,

00:43:06.799 --> 00:43:11.799
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:43:11.799 --> 00:43:15.799
That treasure in heaven that Jesus spoke about in Matthew 6,

00:43:15.799 --> 00:43:20.799
that eternal perspective, that eternal focus.

00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:23.799
Seek those things which are above.

00:43:23.799 --> 00:43:25.799
Set your affection on things above.

00:43:25.799 --> 00:43:28.799
Having that eternal perspective in life.

00:43:28.799 --> 00:43:31.799
Because the reality is that the things which are seen,

00:43:31.799 --> 00:43:33.799
as Paul says here in verse 18,

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:34.799
they're temporal.

00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:35.799
They're temporal.

00:43:35.799 --> 00:43:38.799
We already gave illustration of that

00:43:38.799 --> 00:43:41.799
with regard to possessions and cars.

00:43:41.799 --> 00:43:44.799
Why is it that the first, maybe someone has,

00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:47.799
but typically the first brand new car you ever bought,

00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:49.799
you don't have it anymore.

00:43:49.799 --> 00:43:54.799
I remember the first brand new car I ever bought.

00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:58.799
I believe it was a 2000 Chevy Cavalier.

00:43:58.799 --> 00:44:00.799
Silver.

00:44:00.799 --> 00:44:02.799
I drove that thing for about 108,000 miles

00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:04.799
and it needed so much work on it

00:44:04.799 --> 00:44:07.799
that it was just sent into the junkyard.

00:44:07.799 --> 00:44:11.799
Honestly.

00:44:11.799 --> 00:44:12.799
Because why?

00:44:12.799 --> 00:44:14.799
It broke down.

00:44:14.799 --> 00:44:15.799
They're temporal.

00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:17.799
They're temporal.

00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:21.799
But he says the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:44:21.799 --> 00:44:25.799
This morning when you think about the Apostle Paul,

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:28.799
and I know that he has a different perspective about himself

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.799
than we would have of him,

00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:32.799
and he desires, even as he says,

00:44:32.799 --> 00:44:35.799
that men would not think of him more highly than they should,

00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:40.799
which is really the true understanding of humility.

00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:42.799
But you think about the Apostle Paul.

00:44:42.799 --> 00:44:46.799
Could we say this morning that he had an eternal focus?

00:44:46.799 --> 00:44:48.799
I believe he did.

00:44:48.799 --> 00:44:51.799
See, I don't believe that Paul is simply writing to the believers in Colossae

00:44:51.799 --> 00:44:54.799
and telling them to do something that he's not willing to do.

00:44:54.799 --> 00:44:58.799
I believe that Paul is seeking to encourage these believers in Colossae.

00:44:58.799 --> 00:45:03.799
Listen, as he is helping them to be mindful of their position,

00:45:03.799 --> 00:45:06.799
I hope this morning we'd be mindful of our position.

00:45:06.799 --> 00:45:08.799
If you say, I have no idea what you're talking about,

00:45:08.799 --> 00:45:10.799
I've never been born again,

00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:12.799
I don't know for sure that heaven's my home,

00:45:12.799 --> 00:45:15.799
I'm not a child of the King, I don't know,

00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:18.799
then today is the day of salvation.

00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:24.799
Today the decision for you is to trust Christ as your personal Savior.

00:45:24.799 --> 00:45:26.799
No man knows what a day would bring forth.

00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:29.799
Boast not, is what Proverbs says,

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:33.799
thyself of tomorrow.

00:45:33.799 --> 00:45:34.799
So get that settled.

00:45:34.799 --> 00:45:35.799
Be mindful of your position.

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:40.799
Know that you are complete in Christ, that you're a child of the King.

00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:43.799
And then evaluate your pursuits.

00:45:43.799 --> 00:45:45.799
What is it that I'm truly pursuing?

00:45:45.799 --> 00:45:47.799
Am I pursuing God?

00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:49.799
Am I pursuing God?

00:45:49.799 --> 00:45:52.799
The songwriter said this,

00:45:52.799 --> 00:45:55.799
O soul, are you weary and troubled?

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:57.799
No light in the darkness you see.

00:45:57.799 --> 00:45:59.799
There's light for a look at the Savior,

00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:02.799
in life more abundant and free.

00:46:03.799 --> 00:46:06.799
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.

00:46:06.799 --> 00:46:09.799
Look full in His wonderful face,

00:46:09.799 --> 00:46:14.799
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim

00:46:14.799 --> 00:46:19.799
in the light of His glory and grace.

00:46:19.799 --> 00:46:22.799
That we'd have that eternal perspective,

00:46:22.799 --> 00:46:24.799
that eternal pursuit.

00:46:24.799 --> 00:46:26.799
Those things which are not seen.

00:46:26.799 --> 00:46:28.799
There are two other verses to that song,

00:46:28.799 --> 00:46:29.799
Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus.

00:46:29.799 --> 00:46:31.799
What a great song it is.

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:34.799
And truly, as we are seeking those things which are above,

00:46:34.799 --> 00:46:36.799
as we set our affection on things above,

00:46:36.799 --> 00:46:39.799
the things of this earth will grow strangely dim.

00:46:39.799 --> 00:46:42.799
It doesn't mean that you don't need those things.

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:46.799
It doesn't mean that you don't have need for some of those items that are available.

00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:52.799
But it means that they no longer hold that same place in your life.

00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:54.799
Because they're just things.

00:46:54.799 --> 00:46:56.799
They're just things.

00:46:56.799 --> 00:46:57.799
Let's pray.

00:46:57.799 --> 00:46:59.799
Father, we love You this morning.

00:46:59.799 --> 00:47:02.799
We thank You for loving us.

00:47:02.799 --> 00:47:07.799
We thank You for the opportunity to study Your Word.

00:47:07.799 --> 00:47:09.799
We thank You for this great book

00:47:09.799 --> 00:47:17.799
and the way in which the Word of God helps us,

00:47:17.799 --> 00:47:19.799
encourages us,

00:47:19.799 --> 00:47:22.799
instructs us.

00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:26.799
Lord, this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:47:26.799 --> 00:47:31.799
I pray that You would help us to be mindful of our position in Christ.

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:35.799
Thank You for salvation.

00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:38.799
If there is one present that's not sure of heaven,

00:47:38.799 --> 00:47:41.799
oh, we pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin,

00:47:41.799 --> 00:47:44.799
of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come.

00:47:44.799 --> 00:47:46.799
That before it's eternally too late,

00:47:46.799 --> 00:47:52.799
they would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:47:52.799 --> 00:47:54.799
For those of us that have been born again,

00:47:54.799 --> 00:47:58.799
as we rejoice in our position in Christ,

00:47:58.799 --> 00:48:03.799
I pray also that You would help us to be mindful of that which we are pursuing.

00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:09.799
That we would truly evaluate our pursuits.

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:18.799
I pray that You'd give us a thirst and a hunger for Thee, O Lord.

00:48:18.799 --> 00:48:21.799
I pray that You'd do a work in these few moments of invitation

00:48:21.799 --> 00:48:23.799
that only You could do.

00:48:23.799 --> 00:48:28.799
Help us to be conformed to the image of Your dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:48:28.799 --> 00:48:32.799
That the decisions that would be made would be sealed.

00:48:32.799 --> 00:48:34.799
And we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray.

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:36.799
Would you stand with me?

00:48:36.799 --> 00:48:39.799
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:39.799 --> 00:48:41.799
We will conclude the service with an invitation

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:47.799
and ask you to respond to how the Lord may have spoken to your heart this morning through His Word.

00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:50.799
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:48:50.799 --> 00:48:53.799
Feel free to make your pew and altar come to this old-fashioned altar.

00:48:53.799 --> 00:48:55.799
But as she plays, the altar is open.
