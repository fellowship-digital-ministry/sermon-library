1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
chapter number one, and that shouldn't be hard to find.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,619
And then once you have your place there to turn,

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:09,060
if you will, to Psalm 147.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,420
And if you want to stick a bookmark there in Psalm 147,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,859
a ribbon, a something put there in Psalm 147,

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,459
we'll be there in just a moment.

7
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,500
And I want to look at a passage of scripture here

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,780
in Genesis chapter number one,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,700
and then we'll go there to Psalm 147.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,260
Last week, if you were here,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,700
you know that we examined creation.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,299
And as we looked at the truth of creation,

13
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,940
we looked at Psalm 34.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,939
He spake and it was done.

15
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,779
And then we looked at a number of verses here

16
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:38,060
in the book of Genesis in the first chapter

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,259
and dealing with the repeated phrases

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,180
where the Bible says God said, and it was so.

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,139
We mentioned that creation reveals to us

20
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,419
the greatness of God,

21
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:50,599
because we find that creation reveals

22
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,299
that our God is omnipotent,

23
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,900
that he has all power, that indeed he is great in power.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,299
We said not only does creation reveal to us

25
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,700
that our God is omnipotent,

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,660
but our God is omniscient, that he has perfect knowledge.

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,980
He is great in wisdom.

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,260
And I'm thankful that our God is great in power

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,300
and great in wisdom.

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm thankful for what Job said,

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,819
that the reality is that not only does our God

32
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,660
have the wisdom, but he has the power to do

33
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,699
what needs to be done.

34
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,459
And I'm so grateful for that.

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,580
And then as we concluded the message last week,

36
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,000
we dealt with the fact that creation reveals to us

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,040
that our God is a God of order.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,839
And I'm so thankful that our God is a God of order.

39
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:33,760
We live in the time of chaos and confusion

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,800
and all sorts of things going on,

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,480
but our God is a God of order and we can rejoice in that.

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,519
And we've mentioned as we have as our theme,

43
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,199
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,

44
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:48,199
that we wanna understand as we look at that truth

45
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,559
throughout the year,

46
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:52,160
number one, we wanna recognize his greatness.

47
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,959
And how is it when we come, we say,

48
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,440
yes, God is great, but how do we know that God is great?

49
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,120
And over these few weeks, we're going to deal with

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,720
recognizing God's greatness through creation

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,620
and how creation reveals to us that our God is great.

52
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,600
And as we enter into the end of the year,

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,660
really midpoint of the year,

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,360
we'll deal with our response to God's greatness.

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
And before we can respond to his greatness,

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
we must know that he is great.

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,839
And what a blessing to know the great God

58
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,940
and our savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

59
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:25,619
We're looking for his appearing, by the way,

60
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:28,699
that's what Titus is told by the apostle Paul,

61
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,820
looking for the blessed hope, right?

62
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,419
The glorious appearing of our great God and savior,

63
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,940
the Lord Jesus Christ.

64
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,660
And I'm so thankful that one day,

65
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,860
and I believe soon he's coming again.

66
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,059
In Genesis one, notice in verse number,

67
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,979
we'll read verses 14 and following.

68
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,580
Notice the Bible says in verse number 14,

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,380
and God said, let there be lights

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,960
in the firmament of the heaven

71
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,419
to divide the day from the night,

72
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,539
let them be for signs and for seasons

73
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,300
and for days and years.

74
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,940
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven

75
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,100
to give light upon the earth.

76
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,059
And it was so.

77
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,619
And God made two great lights,

78
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:03,619
the greater light to rule the day,

79
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,979
the lesser light to rule the night.

80
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,179
He made the stars also.

81
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,660
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven

82
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,940
to give light upon the earth

83
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,460
and to rule over the day and over the night,

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,119
divide the light from the darkness.

85
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,580
And God saw that it was good

86
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,779
in the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

87
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,100
This morning, I wanna consider a single aspect of creation

88
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,820
that God reveals to us that took place here

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,460
on the fourth day of creation.

90
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,539
We read the entirety of that day of creation

91
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,779
in verse 14 down through verse number 19,

92
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,740
the text that we read this morning.

93
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,059
But I wanna draw your attention

94
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,740
to the last portion of verse number 16.

95
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,100
It's just five simple words in the English language,

96
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,699
but oh, the depths of what is communicated

97
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,300
through these five simple words.

98
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,300
When the Bible says this, He made the stars also.

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,259
He made the stars also.

100
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,899
We'll use it as our title for the message this evening,

101
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,300
this morning, excuse me.

102
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,740
And I've already fast forward to tonight,

103
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,460
but for this morning, we'll look at this text of scripture.

104
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
He made the stars also.

105
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,139
Remember what Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 32 in verse 17,

106
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,140
all Lord God, thou hast made the heaven and the earth

107
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,779
by thy great power and stretched out arm.

108
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,260
And then notice how it impacted Jeremiah.

109
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,579
And there is nothing too hard for thee.

110
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,899
He recognized that God is the creator.

111
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,299
He says, God, you've made the heaven and the earth.

112
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:40,660
And obviously we understand all that is contained therein.

113
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,299
Oh, the power of our God.

114
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,059
He did it by his great power and his stretched out arm.

115
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,019
We find that in Genesis chapter 15,

116
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,059
if you take and turn over there, if you will,

117
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,980
and then eventually we'll get to Psalm 147.

118
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,019
But notice in Genesis 15,

119
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,420
this is the understanding of this covenant

120
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,980
that God would make with Abram.

121
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,380
His name would soon in a few chapters be changed to Abraham.

122
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,299
But at this particular time in history, His name is Abram.

123
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,739
And the Bible says in verse number one,

124
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,579
after these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abram

125
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,820
in a vision saying, fear not Abram.

126
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,940
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

127
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,299
By the way, that's a great entrance, is it not?

128
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,899
When God says, fear not,

129
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,619
the girls just sang about not having any fear.

130
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:25,779
And we see that the Bible says to Abram to fear not,

131
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,940
if you understand the context of chapter 14

132
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,380
and why there might be reason for fear

133
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,140
because of that coalition of armies that was defeated

134
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,059
and how Lot was rescued by Abram and so on and so forth,

135
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:39,260
that God shows up and says, hey, Abram, don't fear.

136
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
Why?

137
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

138
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,380
Notice in verse number two,

139
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,980
that Abram then says to the Lord, he says, Lord God,

140
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,459
what will thou give me seeing I go childless?

141
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,579
The steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus.

142
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,739
And Abram said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed

143
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:04,660
and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

144
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,339
This was his logic.

145
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:10,579
This was his reason on how God might use Eleazar

146
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,140
to be his heir.

147
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,019
But we find that God responds in verse number four

148
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,459
and says, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him

149
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,459
saying, this shall not be thine heir,

150
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:23,619
but he that shall come forth out of thine own mouth

151
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:24,579
shall be thine heir.

152
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,700
And then notice this in verse number five.

153
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,059
And he brought him forth abroad.

154
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:35,059
God brings Abram out and says, look now toward heaven.

155
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,380
And tell the stars.

156
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,700
Genesis one, the Bible says that he made the stars also.

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,619
And as God is giving this promise to Abram,

158
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:48,779
he takes him out in the night and he says to Abram,

159
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,779
he says, look toward heaven and tell the stars.

160
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:58,899
Notice what he says, if thou be able to number them.

161
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,339
Have you ever tried to count the stars?

162
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,739
Honestly, I never have.

163
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,779
I've never tried.

164
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,779
I know some that have.

165
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:14,459
When I was about 13 years old,

166
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,500
I went walking out of my house.

167
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,899
We lived in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

168
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,579
The neighbor that lived on this corner,

169
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,859
there was a road in between our house and their house.

170
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,260
They had three children, two daughters and a son.

171
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,220
The son was the oldest, I don't remember his name.

172
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,299
But I remember walking out one night, early evening,

173
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,739
and I walked out and he was standing

174
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,220
in the middle of his front yard and he was doing this.

175
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,019
And I thought, what is that guy doing?

176
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:40,940
He's crazy.

177
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,700
And I walked over there and I called him by name

178
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,540
and said, what are you doing?

179
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,500
He said, you made me lose count.

180
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,339
I said, count of what?

181
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,179
He said, I was counting the stars.

182
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,100
You're doing what?

183
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,859
But notice what God says.

184
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,619
So shall thy seed be.

185
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,260
God is giving, using his creation to reinforce a promise

186
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,779
that God has given to Abram.

187
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,820
And he says to Abram, look toward heaven.

188
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,140
You see all those stars out there?

189
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,100
Are you able to number them?

190
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,380
Of course he cannot.

191
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,980
We find that God would use his creation

192
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,859
to reinforce this promise.

193
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,660
And the Bible says that Abram, in verse number six,

194
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,099
that he believed in the Lord.

195
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,219
He counted it to him for righteousness.

196
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,940
Oh, isn't that wonderful to see the faith of Abram?

197
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,780
Many of us this morning would be familiar

198
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,099
with the declaration of the psalmist in Psalm 19

199
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,859
in verse number one, where the Bible says,

200
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,380
the heavens declare the glory of God

201
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,020
and the firmament showeth his handiwork.

202
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:52,979
This morning as we sit here

203
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,900
and I've asked the question already,

204
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,059
have you ever tried to count the number of stars?

205
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,780
The reality is that none of us would be capable

206
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,140
of counting the number of stars.

207
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,179
It's beyond our ability.

208
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,219
In fact, with all of the advancement in technology

209
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,739
and all of the things that exist,

210
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,859
we find that even still today,

211
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,340
that scientists are only able to offer us

212
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,419
with an estimate as to how many stars

213
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,119
are actually in the universe.

214
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,820
The number of stars that they estimate

215
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,659
to be in our universe is this, 200 billion trillion.

216
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,659
I mean, I don't even know how you think about it.

217
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,739
Honestly, when I think about that number,

218
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:33,679
my mind cannot wrap around that number.

219
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:40,219
200 billion trillion is the estimate

220
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,659
as to how many stars are in our universe.

221
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:47,419
You think about that number and you find

222
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:52,179
that that number is huge, beyond my ability,

223
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,219
at least, to comprehend.

224
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,299
How many zeros is that?

225
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,580
I have no idea.

226
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,900
I mean, scientific notation.

227
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,820
is needed for that, amen, because it's something to some big power, right?

228
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,780
I don't even know how many zeros there are.

229
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:15,880
But the reality is that with that many estimated to be that number of stars in our universe,

230
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:25,980
do you know, not including our sun, that the next closest star to earth is 25.3 trillion

231
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
miles away?

232
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,900
25.3 trillion miles, four and a half or so light years away, is the next closest star

233
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,020
to earth.

234
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,820
That's phenomenal to me.

235
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:50,100
And God simply says in Genesis, He made the stars also.

236
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,700
It's important for us to understand this morning that God did not make the stars so that mankind

237
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,740
would worship the stars.

238
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,940
Now we understand that there's a segment of human population throughout the centuries

239
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,540
that have worshipped the heavenlies, that have worshipped the stars, and that is not

240
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,300
in any way, shape or form, the reason that God created the stars.

241
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,540
In fact, He tells us there in Genesis why He did, but I find as we look at Psalm 147,

242
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,580
that rather than man worshipping the stars, we find that God created the stars in order

243
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:31,580
to demonstrate His great power and His infinite wisdom, so that man would worship the Creator.

244
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,100
That we'd understand how great He is.

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,140
It's interesting as we look at Psalm 147 this morning and examine these few verses of Scripture,

246
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,420
the Bible begins in verse number one, really our text will be verses three through six,

247
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,300
but let me read verse number one as we get into it.

248
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,980
The Bible says, praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for

249
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,380
it is pleasant, and praise is comely.

250
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,060
Oh, how important it is that we praise our God.

251
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,060
By the way, we have much to praise Him for.

252
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,700
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the outcast of Israel, He healeth

253
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,740
the broken and hardened, bindeth up their wounds, He telleth the number of the stars,

254
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,460
He calleth them all by their names.

255
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,980
Great is our Lord and of great power, His understanding is infinite.

256
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,220
The Lord lifteth up the meek, He casteth the wicked down to the ground.

257
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,140
I want to focus our attention this morning on verses three through six here from Psalm

258
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
147.

259
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,260
If you're taking notes, number one, I want you to note the powerful proclamation.

260
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,940
In verses four and five, God gives us this powerful proclamation and it really deals

261
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,640
with His power and His wisdom.

262
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,220
We mention as we look at Psalm 19 about the heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament

263
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,620
showeth His handiwork.

264
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,780
As we look there in Genesis chapter one that He made the stars also, we find that the psalmist

265
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,460
now again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, begins to reference the stars

266
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,180
in verses four and five.

267
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,260
Then we find this powerful proclamation is given to us with regard to the stars, God's

268
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,180
creation, and notice first of all in verse number four, the Bible says this, He, God,

269
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,340
the Lord, the one that's to be praised in verse number one, He telleth the number of

270
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
the stars.

271
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,060
Listen, God doesn't have to give an estimate.

272
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,420
He knows exactly how many stars there are.

273
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:30,380
He does not have to wonder as our scientists have given us these estimates of 200 billion

274
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
trillion.

275
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,940
No, God knows precisely exactly the number of stars.

276
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,340
The Bible declares to us that He telleth the number of the stars, but He stood before Abram

277
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,980
and He says, Abram, look up to heaven and see if you can tell the number of stars.

278
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,780
Abram's just a man.

279
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,980
He's like we are, flesh and blood.

280
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,760
Just as we can relate to Abram and say with Abram, no, it is impossible for me to number

281
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:06,240
the stars, but God, He telleth the number of them, of the stars.

282
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,900
Notice in this powerful proclamation, not only does God tell us that He knows the number

283
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,800
of the stars, but it's amazing in the end of verse number four, the Bible says this,

284
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,880
He calleth them, the stars, all by their names.

285
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,200
Isn't that amazing?

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:36,600
He knoweth the number of the stars and He calleth them all by their names.

287
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,320
This is absolutely fascinating to me when I consider the infinite wisdom and the great

288
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,080
power of our God and He says in Genesis one, He made the stars also, but He knows how many

289
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,800
He made and He gave each of them a name.

290
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
This is phenomenal.

291
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,320
How many names do you think you know?

292
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,760
How many people do you think within your circle that you know?

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,400
I mean, maybe a couple of hundred, maybe more for certain people, right?

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,680
But the reality, have you ever forgotten somebody's name?

295
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Miss Mariah and Mana were walking out of church last Sunday night and I looked straight at

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,760
Mariah and called her Mana and she, Mana was standing right next to her, but I called her

297
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,520
and I said, man, I'm sorry, Mariah, I know your name is Mariah.

298
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm normally pretty good with names and I'm not saying that to pat myself on the back,

299
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,320
I really work on it, I try to be careful with it, I try to learn people's names.

300
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:37,040
Cole over here, man, I was messed up thinking his name was Connor because he looks like

301
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
my niece's boyfriend in Texas, Connor.

302
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,820
He looks just like him, not just like him, but close.

303
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,600
And I knew it started with a C and man, every time I'd see him walk in, I'm like, what is

304
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
his name?

305
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,280
I know it's not Cole, I mean, I know it's not Connor, but that's what I want to call

306
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
him.

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,460
And so I finally put him aside one day and I said, listen, just remind me of your name.

308
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,080
And I don't think I've forgotten since.

309
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,800
I try to, but sometimes we forget people's names, right?

310
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Two hundred billion trillion is the estimate of man as to the number of stars.

311
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,400
God knows exactly how many there are and He calls them all by their name.

312
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,280
That's phenomenal to me.

313
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,680
Now this great, powerful proclamation of Psalm 147 in verse number four is followed up in

314
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,040
verse number five by revealing to us and helping us understand what God is seeking to communicate

315
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,580
to us as His creation with this reference to the stars.

316
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,280
It is this, number one, He is great.

317
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,800
Notice in verse number five, great is our Lord.

318
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,880
I mean, how else do you walk away from the powerful proclamation of verse number four

319
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,200
without or with any other response than God's great?

320
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:10,400
I mean, that's the immediate response, great is our Lord, notice, and of great power.

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,840
Yes, we mentioned last week the power of God.

322
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,280
And the psalmist continues and says, His understanding is infinite.

323
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,600
His understanding is infinite.

324
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,680
And so when we begin to notice this powerful proclamation in Psalm 147 verses four and

325
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,560
five, we see that He knows exactly the number of stars and He has given all of them a name

326
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:45,520
and He knows them, He calls them by their names, reveals to us that He's a great God,

327
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,800
He has great power, and that His understanding is infinite.

328
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,680
But I want you to understand this morning that this powerful proclamation is sandwiched

329
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,760
in between some precious promises.

330
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,720
And if you're taking notes, the second thought this morning is consider the precious promises.

331
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,840
We find that verse four and five, this great proclamation of our God and His power and

332
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,760
His wisdom, His understanding, and we can understand that He transcends us, His power

333
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,840
and His knowledge is so far greater than anything we could even begin to comprehend.

334
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,240
But this truth is sandwiched between some precious promises that God is giving to us

335
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,520
as the crown of His creation, mankind.

336
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,160
Next week, I'm going to preach and it's on the front of our bulletin this week, so we're

337
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,080
a week off, but it says, I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

338
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,119
I'm going to preach a message on that very title next week, I am fearfully and wonderfully

339
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,119
made.

340
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,400
I say we're a week off just joking on that, we don't create the bulletins, they just come

341
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,040
in and we use them and I saw them and Holly got done printing them and I said, oh, that's

342
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
my title for my message next week.

343
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,840
But anyhow, I want you to notice these precious promises.

344
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:20,860
The all-powerful, all-wise God who spoke the world into existence, who knows the number

345
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:32,220
of stars, who calls them all by their name, is concerned about you as an individual.

346
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:40,660
With all the wonder and the beauty of creation, with all that we see and we can look into

347
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,260
the heavenlies and we can see the power, the glory, the work of our God, we understand

348
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:55,420
that He is concerned about you, He's concerned about me, He's concerned about us as individuals.

349
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,340
Do you think this morning that if He knows the stars by name?

350
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,020
Have you considered that He knows your name?

351
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,540
Isn't that precious?

352
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,740
There's a song last week, Brianna and Joseph sang, in the middle of my storm, the same

353
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,620
fella that wrote that song sang another song, I didn't write the song, but He knows my name.

354
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,220
And some of you may have heard that song at some point, but He knows my name.

355
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,580
Listen, I'm so thankful that He knows my name and that He knows your name because He's concerned

356
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
with us as individuals.

357
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,340
Now let's consider these promises, let's note them here in verses 3 and verse number 6.

358
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,580
There are three of them and they're so precious.

359
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,020
Notice in verse number 3, the first of these three promises, the Bible says this, He healeth

360
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,020
the broken in heart.

361
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,860
He healeth the broken in heart.

362
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,340
This same God who knows the number of the stars, the same God who calls them all by

363
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,020
their names, this God that is great in power, that His understanding is infinite, that for

364
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:11,100
us as His people, His creation, He says this, that He healeth the broken in heart.

365
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,940
Oh, that's a precious truth of the Word of God.

366
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,780
I want you to understand this morning that God does not say in Psalm 147 and verse number

367
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,100
3, He does not say that you would not have a broken heart.

368
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:34,100
He says that He healeth the broken in heart, and that ought to be precious to us.

369
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,420
See, there are times in our lives where perhaps we go around and we think that we're never

370
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,340
going to have a broken heart, we're never going to have this difficulty, we're never

371
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,620
going to experience this hardship, but God, the God who said He made the stars also, the

372
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,620
one who knows their number, and He calls them by their name, He says, listen, I understand

373
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:00,380
that as an individual at some point you might have a broken heart, but He healeth the broken

374
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
heart.

375
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,460
Oh, that's so precious to me.

376
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,440
And I hold it dear, why?

377
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,860
Because we are frail people.

378
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,620
God knows our frame, He's made us and He knows what we're made of, and He knows what we endure,

379
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,020
and He knows what we go through, and He knows that there are times that we might have a

380
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:25,820
broken heart, but He heals.

381
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,620
Do you not think this morning that the God who spoke it all into creation, the God who

382
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,060
the Bible says He made the stars also, that He knoweth their number and He calls them

383
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:46,020
by name, do you think this morning that He doesn't know about your condition?

384
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,820
He knows, listen, if you have a broken heart this morning, God knows it, and the wonderful

385
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,500
thing is not just that God knows that you have a broken heart, but the precious truth

386
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:04,700
of the Word of God is that the Bible says that He healeth the broken in heart.

387
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:13,180
We do not need to be shamed or shameful if we have a time in which our heart is overwhelmed,

388
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,500
a time in which we would say our heart is breaking over the things that we're dealing

389
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,400
with.

390
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,580
We need not pretend, we need not to put on a facade, we need not to act as if we got

391
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,420
it all under control, no, we go to the One who heals the broken heart, and that's such

392
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,700
a precious truth of the Word of God.

393
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,820
Turn back if you will, keep your place here, we'll be back in just a moment, but turn to

394
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:47,340
the book of…we're in the book of Psalms, turn to Psalm 61.

395
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,700
So many of the Psalms are so precious to us.

396
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,660
I mentioned to you a few Sunday nights ago that I'm going to, by God's grace and with

397
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,740
God's help, in addition to reading through the Scriptures this year, I'm going to read

398
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,580
the book of Psalms and Proverbs each month.

399
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,900
I've already been so encouraged and so blessed.

400
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,380
Psalm 61 begins, we look at the Psalms and we see how the psalmist is so transparent.

401
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,260
Hear my cry, O God, attend unto my prayer.

402
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,420
From the end of the earth will I cry unto Thee.

403
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,820
Notice what he says, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

404
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:40,500
You say, I don't know, my heart's overwhelmed, I'm just not…you're human, it happens.

405
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,300
There are times in which our hearts are broken, but how we rejoice in understanding even what

406
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,980
the psalmist says here in Psalm 61, that when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock

407
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,660
that is higher than I, that we find that the psalmist tells us here in Psalm 147 in verse

408
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,820
number 3, he healeth the broken in heart.

409
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,180
Oh, this morning.

410
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,460
We know people that have broken hearts.

411
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,340
You say, pastor, I'm one of them.

412
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,620
Maybe you are, you know.

413
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:23,540
You're going through something this morning, a season, whatever it might be.

414
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Maybe you know someone.

415
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,540
Man, I don't know how people do it without Jesus, honestly.

416
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:39,460
I don't know how people do it without Jesus, because we face some difficulties in life.

417
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:46,140
We face a troubled time, but isn't it wonderful to know that our God reigns?

418
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,860
Isn't it wonderful to know the one that heals the broken heart?

419
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,500
And again, sandwiched in between these promises is the fact that he knows the number of the

420
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
stars.

421
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
He calls them by their name.

422
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
He's great in power.

423
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
He's great.

424
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
He's great in power.

425
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,420
His understanding is infinite.

426
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,540
And it helps me because I understand that, listen, if he's able to do all of that, that

427
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,620
powerful proclamation in verse 4 and 5, if he's able to do all of that with regard to

428
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,060
creation and all of the stars and all of his power and his wisdom, then certainly he has

429
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:27,740
the ability to heal my broken heart and to heal your broken heart and to give you what

430
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:33,180
you need in the moment of what you're going through.

431
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,500
But it's God that heals the broken heart.

432
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,900
Sometimes we look for someone else to heal the broken heart.

433
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,980
We think some other circumstance or some other thing is going to heal our broken heart, but

434
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,540
it is God who makes the proclamation.

435
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,940
He makes this precious promise that it is He that healeth the broken heart.

436
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh, this morning, I hope that you would take great comfort in this first promise.

437
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
But he continues.

438
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:10,940
Notice again in verse number 3, the Bible says this, and bindeth up their wounds.

439
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,100
He bindeth up their wounds.

440
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,500
The word wounds means sorrow, pain, or hurt.

441
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,180
The word bindeth literally carries with it the context of a, of bandaging something.

442
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,380
And I want you to, in your mind this morning, get this picture where the Bible says that

443
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,020
He, God, the Lord, the one who created the stars, the one who knows their number that

444
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,340
calls them by their names, that He binds your wounds.

445
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,740
Again, as I mentioned in the first promise, again here we find that He does not say that

446
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,980
your life will be free from wounds.

447
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:54,420
Rather, He says that He bindeth up their wounds.

448
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,220
I think about the little child.

449
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,940
I think about our children.

450
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,620
I think about when I was a child.

451
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,300
I think about our children.

452
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,260
You think about the times in which they would get hurt, learning to ride a bike.

453
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,060
That's always a difficult time in life, isn't it?

454
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,300
Trying to get a child to learn how to ride a bike, and get to that point where you're

455
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,940
going to take those training wheels off, right?

456
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
And what's going to happen?

457
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,700
You better have a good supply of Band-Aids, right?

458
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,820
Have any of you, you remember your kids learn how to ride a bike, or maybe your kids are

459
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,900
in that stage of learning to ride a bike?

460
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,220
We have some in church that like Band-Aids a whole lot.

461
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,940
I see them with Band-Aids on all the time, right?

462
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,900
There's something about riding the bike, and skinning up your knees, right?

463
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,460
And it happens, your elbows, and all sorts of things.

464
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,740
See, back when I was a kid learning how to do it, they didn't have all these knee pads,

465
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,660
elbow pads, and all this helmet stuff.

466
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,660
Man, you just had to rub some dirt on it and get over it, you know?

467
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Like just whatever.

468
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,220
And my dad, he just said amen.

469
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,460
He was not the person I went to when I had a wound that had to be bound up, amen?

470
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,380
And he took my thunder already.

471
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:12,300
But the reality is that when our kids were going through those stages, they'd fall and

472
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,580
they'd cut up their knee, or their hand, or their elbow.

473
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,380
You know who they'd come running to?

474
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,820
Holly, mom.

475
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:32,700
And they'd be crying, and it would be almost just beyond the ability to calm them down.

476
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,900
And Holly would calmly take them into the bathroom, try to get them cleaned up, bandage

477
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
that wound.

478
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,580
You know when all of a sudden it starts happening to that child?

479
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,860
They're calm.

480
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,740
Why?

481
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:58,900
Because someone who loves them is binding up, bandaging their wounds.

482
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,420
And maybe...

483
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,420
moms from time to time have other means of helping calm

484
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,060
and soothe their children.

485
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,500
Let's go get a popsicle, a cookie, a something, right?

486
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,660
And man, it just seems to make everything better.

487
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,580
We understand that physically speaking,

488
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,140
that we understand the idea of having a wound,

489
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,020
having something that someone then bandages up

490
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,780
and provides that comfort for us that we need

491
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,020
and helps us to heal that thing up.

492
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,420
But we look at the word of God and the Bible says,

493
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,780
not only does God heal the broken in heart,

494
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,320
but he says that he bindeth up their wounds.

495
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,380
You say, pastor, I have some pains, I have some hurts,

496
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,220
I have some sorrow, then rejoice in knowing

497
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,200
that God binds them up.

498
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,240
Oh, what a joy, what a blessing.

499
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Why didn't my children come to me?

500
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,480
Maybe I was not as compassionate.

501
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,480
Why did I go to my mom and not to my dad?

502
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,140
Because he was not as compassionate.

503
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,560
You ever have a thought that you broke something?

504
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,620
You know what my dad would do?

505
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,640
Tim, stand up for just a minute.

506
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,720
I'd tell him I thought I broke my arm, he'd say,

507
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,760
nah, it's good.

508
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,820
That's how it works sometimes.

509
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
But God is compassionate.

510
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,960
God is full of grace and mercy.

511
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,080
And he knows what your wounds are.

512
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,440
He knows what your hurts are.

513
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,880
He knows that if you're carrying that load,

514
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,480
he knows and he tells us, he gives us this precious promise

515
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,880
that he bindeth up their wounds.

516
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm so thankful that I don't have to just live life

517
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
with my wounds.

518
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,760
Again, he didn't say that we'd never have wounds.

519
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,400
He says that he would bind them up.

520
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,480
They don't have to stay as open wounds.

521
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,960
They don't have to become infected wounds.

522
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,200
You know what happens when they stay open

523
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,120
and they become infected?

524
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,440
Starts to impact other areas of your life.

525
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Spiritually, we're speaking now.

526
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,080
We see it physically.

527
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,160
You gotta deal with the wounds.

528
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,720
You gotta deal with them.

529
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
You gotta medicate them.

530
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,720
You gotta make sure infection doesn't set in, right?

531
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,400
There are times in which people have wounds

532
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,640
and doctors will put marks on their arms

533
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,760
to see where the infection has spread to

534
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,680
and they need to come back.

535
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,240
And if it passes this line, that stuff happens.

536
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,120
But can I tell you what happens in our hearts

537
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,760
and our lives when we have wounds

538
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
and we don't go to the one that binds up the wounds?

539
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,680
We get bitter.

540
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,680
We get bitter.

541
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,080
And bitterness destroys.

542
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,600
When we get bitter, no longer are we able to be in a place

543
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,800
where we're used of God for his honor and for his glory.

544
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,340
We get so focused on ourselves and we're so angry

545
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,120
at whoever it was that hurt us and whatever took place

546
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,480
and whatever those wounds are.

547
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,120
And we're just bitter.

548
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,280
Someone said this, it's not original with me,

549
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,400
but bitterness destroys the vessel in which it's stored

550
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,940
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

551
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,240
The reality this morning is that when wounds

552
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,520
are not addressed and taken care of,

553
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,740
it can cause this root of bitterness.

554
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,480
Aren't you thankful this morning

555
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,560
that though we experience wounds in our lives,

556
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,280
that they don't have to go as open wounds.

557
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,520
They don't have to become infected wounds.

558
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,360
Why?

559
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,760
Because our God, the Bible says,

560
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,660
that he bindeth up their wounds.

561
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,760
You say, oh, you don't know how deeply hurt I am.

562
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,720
Remember, he spoke and it was so.

563
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,080
The Bible says he made the stars also.

564
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
He knows their number.

565
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,560
He calls them by name.

566
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,880
You're gonna tell me that you have a wound

567
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
that he can't heal?

568
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,160
Come on.

569
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,280
He bindeth up their wounds.

570
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,880
Notice verse number six,

571
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,860
the third promise that is given to us.

572
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,240
The powerful proclamation is verses four and five,

573
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,480
but these precious promises by which

574
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,240
we receive great comfort this morning,

575
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I hope that we're encouraged this morning.

576
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,000
He healeth the broken in heart.

577
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
He bindeth up their wounds.

578
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,840
Notice in verse number six,

579
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,760
the Lord lifteth up the meek.

580
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,660
The word lifteth up literally means to restore.

581
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,520
The word meek is used in a variety of contexts

582
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,760
throughout the Bible.

583
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,520
Some have looked at meek and looked at it

584
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,600
as being weakness, and not always

585
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,680
is it looked at in that frame.

586
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,000
Power under control is a great way to define meekness.

587
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,640
Meekness in the New Testament,

588
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
when you look at the fruit of the spirit,

589
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,720
it's akin to gentleness.

590
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
We find here that in the context

591
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,540
that's talking about this one that's meek,

592
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,780
that's cast down, and all of that that's taking place,

593
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,200
and all of these things that have really taken place

594
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,720
in the life of this individual,

595
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,480
but the Bible says that the Lord,

596
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,520
the same God who spoke it all into existence,

597
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,000
the one that made the stars also,

598
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
that knows their number, that calls them by their names,

599
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,280
that he lifteth up the meek that he restores.

600
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,480
This morning, as we look at these precious promises,

601
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,320
and we consider them for just a few moments this morning,

602
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,920
I hope that our hearts would be encouraged.

603
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,580
I hope that we would receive great comfort

604
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,960
from the God who is the God of all comfort.

605
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,320
That we understand that though we live in this world,

606
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,180
that we will endure hurt, and we will have times

607
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,840
of brokenheartedness, and wounds,

608
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,040
and times that we're overwhelmed,

609
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,040
that God heals, and he binds, and he lifts, he restores.

610
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,440
I mentioned that this, our God,

611
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,880
who knows the number of the stars,

612
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,960
who calls them all by their names,

613
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,360
that he's interested in us as individuals.

614
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,560
His greatest concern for us is our salvation.

615
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
It's his greatest concern for us.

616
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,080
This morning, I'm thankful for the promises

617
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,820
that we find in verse three and verse number six.

618
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,640
But you know the greatest work

619
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,240
that God's ever done in my life is saving my soul.

620
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,880
And I believe this morning that if you're here,

621
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,320
and you've trusted Christ as your savior,

622
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,600
that you too would testify that the greatest work

623
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,800
he's ever done in your life is saving your soul.

624
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,720
See, he's not willing that any should perish,

625
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,780
but that all should come to repentance.

626
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,520
He's given us the plan of redemption in his word

627
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,320
that mankind can only be saved

628
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,640
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

629
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,440
There's no other name under heaven given among men

630
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,580
whereby we must be saved.

631
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,080
The precious, wonderful name of Jesus.

632
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,880
It's not by works of righteousness which we have done.

633
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,920
It's not by some religion that we've held to.

634
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,040
It's all through the work of Jesus Christ

635
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,820
on the cross of Calvary.

636
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,060
His death, his burial, and his glorious resurrection.

637
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,280
It's Jesus alone.

638
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,000
It's not grace plus works.

639
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,360
It's not grace and anything else.

640
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,960
It's just Jesus.

641
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,920
And this morning, as the people of God,

642
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,500
if you're here this morning and you've been saved

643
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,080
by the blood of Christ, oh, you should rejoice.

644
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,400
But though we've been saved by the,

645
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
and if you've not been saved by the blood of Christ,

646
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,760
if you've not, if you don't know,

647
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,680
if you don't have that assurance,

648
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,280
you're trying to get to heaven on your own some way,

649
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,180
through some church or through some other work,

650
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,400
oh, come to Christ.

651
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
He died for you.

652
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,060
He loves you.

653
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,280
He knows you individually.

654
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
And he died for you.

655
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,280
But for those of us that know Christ as our Savior,

656
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,120
oh, those of us that know that he is the creator,

657
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,240
the truth that we find this powerful proclamation

658
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,400
in verses four and five, yes,

659
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,560
should cause us to stand in awe of who he is.

660
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,200
And we should have the same response as the psalmist has,

661
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,040
great is the Lord and of great power.

662
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
And his understanding is infinite.

663
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,880
But understand this morning

664
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,840
that this powerful proclamation

665
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,280
in verses four and five of Psalm 147

666
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,800
is sandwiched in between

667
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,740
some precious promises for God's people.

668
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,280
And those precious promises

669
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,560
that he healeth the broken in heart,

670
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,060
that he bindeth up their wounds,

671
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,160
that he lifteth up the meek,

672
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,680
that the same God who has promised to do that for you

673
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,640
made the stars also.

674
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
He calls them all by their names.

675
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
He knows their number.

676
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,640
See, it's kind of like,

677
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,600
and the reason that I went to Genesis 15,

678
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,140
it's kind of like Abram.

679
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,320
You ever have your own logic and your own reason?

680
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,400
Abram did.

681
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
Abram said, God, I'm having a child.

682
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
You promised me a seed.

683
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,720
God, can this Eliezer, maybe he'd be the heir?

684
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,840
God says, no, no, Abram, that's not my plan.

685
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,600
God says, listen, I'm going to illustrate.

686
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,940
Come on out here, look up toward the heaven, see all those stars, can you tell the number

687
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
of them?

688
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,880
Of course not.

689
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,800
He says, so shall thy seed be.

690
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,120
This morning, God says to you and He says to me, He made the stars also.

691
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
He knows their number.

692
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:37,160
He calls them all by their names, but He says, I know that my people, they have broken hearts.

693
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,320
I know that my people have wounds.

694
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:47,120
I know that they face difficulties and hardships, but I'm the God who heals the broken heart.

695
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600
That's what God says.

696
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:54,400
I'm the God who bindeth up their wounds.

697
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,080
Can you see God's mercy and His compassion?

698
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:06,840
Like the mother and the child, binding up your wounds, literally to bandage.

699
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,640
He says, I lift up, I restore the meek.

700
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:20,960
Maybe this morning, you say to the Lord, Lord, You know my heart and You know what I'm going

701
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
through.

702
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,440
God, I know who You are, I know that You've created all these things and God, I'm going

703
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,200
to claim these promises.

704
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,320
Maybe you have a wound.

705
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,160
Maybe you've got a wound that's been neglected, it's not been tended to.

706
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,720
You've allowed it to just kind of be open and fester and become infected, if I could

707
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,000
use that terminology this morning.

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,280
Maybe you need to let God bind up, bandage that wound because it's just destroying you

709
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,840
Maybe this morning, say, Lord, I need to be restored.

710
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,520
He lifteth up the meek.

711
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,400
I'm not sure what it is this morning, but I know that the Creator God, who knows the

712
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,920
number and the names of the stars, He knows you as an individual and He loves you and

713
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,840
He knows what you're going through and He says, I can take care of that.

714
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,400
I can handle that, but we've got to let Him.

715
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
We've got to come to Him.

716
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,960
That's why the psalmist says, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is

717
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
higher than I.

718
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,400
Oh, that I would not just try to figure it out myself, try to resolve the matter.

719
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,560
No, no, God, You're the one that heals and binds and lifts.

720
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,640
Let Him have His way.

721
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,800
Let Him do what only He can do.

722
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,000
Aren't they some precious promises?

723
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,360
I mean, it's a powerful proclamation of what God has done with the stars, knowing their

724
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,760
number and their name, but what's more precious to me than He cares about me, He cares about

725
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
you.

726
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,840
He heals, He binds, and He lifts.

727
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
Let's pray.

728
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,320
Lord, we love You this morning and we thank You for loving us.

729
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:39,080
Lord, I don't know, but I take great comfort in knowing that You know every circumstance

730
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:47,720
and situation that every person, under the sound of my voice, is dealing with today.

731
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,320
God, You did not promise that we'd have no broken hearts.

732
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,440
You did not promise that we'd have no wounds, but You promised that You heal and that You

733
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
bind.

734
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Oh, I'm so thankful.

735
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,840
I praise You and I rejoice in You.

736
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,360
Thank You for the testimony of the psalmist.

737
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,480
I thank You for the work You've done in my life over the years.

738
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:24,820
God, I pray this morning, in the time of invitation, as we reflect upon that which we've heard

739
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,440
and we respond to that which we've received from Your Word, as we allow the Holy Spirit

740
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,020
of God to have His will and way in our lives, I pray this morning, God, that we'd respond

741
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,900
in faith, in obedience, in brokenness.

742
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:47,300
God, I don't know the needs, but I'm thankful that You do.

743
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:56,180
And God, I pray that You would work in such a way that You alone would be glorified.

744
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,820
We pray that in these few moments of invitation, there's one that's not sure of heaven.

745
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,420
Oh, God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

746
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,180
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure, 100% certainty that heaven is their

747
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,780
home.

748
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:18,380
I pray that no one would leave this place with a broken heart or a wound, but God, we'd

749
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:24,460
allow You to heal and bind, lift us up.

750
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,500
I pray that You'd be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
