WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
chapter number one, and that shouldn't be hard to find.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.619
And then once you have your place there to turn,

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:09.060
if you will, to Psalm 147.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.420
And if you want to stick a bookmark there in Psalm 147,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.859
a ribbon, a something put there in Psalm 147,

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.459
we'll be there in just a moment.

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:19.500
And I want to look at a passage of scripture here

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.780
in Genesis chapter number one,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.700
and then we'll go there to Psalm 147.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.260
Last week, if you were here,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.700
you know that we examined creation.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.299
And as we looked at the truth of creation,

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:31.940
we looked at Psalm 34.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.939
He spake and it was done.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.779
And then we looked at a number of verses here

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:38.060
in the book of Genesis in the first chapter

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.259
and dealing with the repeated phrases

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.180
where the Bible says God said, and it was so.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.139
We mentioned that creation reveals to us

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:48.419
the greatness of God,

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:50.599
because we find that creation reveals

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.299
that our God is omnipotent,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.900
that he has all power, that indeed he is great in power.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.299
We said not only does creation reveal to us

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.700
that our God is omnipotent,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.660
but our God is omniscient, that he has perfect knowledge.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.980
He is great in wisdom.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.260
And I'm thankful that our God is great in power

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.300
and great in wisdom.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
I'm thankful for what Job said,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.819
that the reality is that not only does our God

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.660
have the wisdom, but he has the power to do

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.699
what needs to be done.

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:20.459
And I'm so grateful for that.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.580
And then as we concluded the message last week,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.000
we dealt with the fact that creation reveals to us

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.040
that our God is a God of order.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.839
And I'm so thankful that our God is a God of order.

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:33.760
We live in the time of chaos and confusion

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.800
and all sorts of things going on,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.480
but our God is a God of order and we can rejoice in that.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.519
And we've mentioned as we have as our theme,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.199
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:48.199
that we wanna understand as we look at that truth

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:49.559
throughout the year,

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:52.160
number one, we wanna recognize his greatness.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.959
And how is it when we come, we say,

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.440
yes, God is great, but how do we know that God is great?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.120
And over these few weeks, we're going to deal with

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.720
recognizing God's greatness through creation

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.620
and how creation reveals to us that our God is great.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.600
And as we enter into the end of the year,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.660
really midpoint of the year,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.360
we'll deal with our response to God's greatness.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.320
And before we can respond to his greatness,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320
we must know that he is great.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.839
And what a blessing to know the great God

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.940
and our savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:25.619
We're looking for his appearing, by the way,

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.699
that's what Titus is told by the apostle Paul,

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.820
looking for the blessed hope, right?

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.419
The glorious appearing of our great God and savior,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.940
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.660
And I'm so thankful that one day,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.860
and I believe soon he's coming again.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.059
In Genesis one, notice in verse number,

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.979
we'll read verses 14 and following.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.580
Notice the Bible says in verse number 14,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.380
and God said, let there be lights

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.960
in the firmament of the heaven

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.419
to divide the day from the night,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.539
let them be for signs and for seasons

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.300
and for days and years.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.940
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.100
to give light upon the earth.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.059
And it was so.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.619
And God made two great lights,

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.619
the greater light to rule the day,

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.979
the lesser light to rule the night.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.179
He made the stars also.

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.660
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.940
to give light upon the earth

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.460
and to rule over the day and over the night,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.119
divide the light from the darkness.

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.580
And God saw that it was good

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.779
in the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.100
This morning, I wanna consider a single aspect of creation

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.820
that God reveals to us that took place here

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.460
on the fourth day of creation.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.539
We read the entirety of that day of creation

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.779
in verse 14 down through verse number 19,

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.740
the text that we read this morning.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.059
But I wanna draw your attention

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.740
to the last portion of verse number 16.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.100
It's just five simple words in the English language,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.699
but oh, the depths of what is communicated

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.300
through these five simple words.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.300
When the Bible says this, He made the stars also.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.259
He made the stars also.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.899
We'll use it as our title for the message this evening,

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.300
this morning, excuse me.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.740
And I've already fast forward to tonight,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.460
but for this morning, we'll look at this text of scripture.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.460
He made the stars also.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.139
Remember what Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 32 in verse 17,

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.140
all Lord God, thou hast made the heaven and the earth

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.779
by thy great power and stretched out arm.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.260
And then notice how it impacted Jeremiah.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.579
And there is nothing too hard for thee.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:32.899
He recognized that God is the creator.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.299
He says, God, you've made the heaven and the earth.

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:40.660
And obviously we understand all that is contained therein.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.299
Oh, the power of our God.

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:45.059
He did it by his great power and his stretched out arm.

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.019
We find that in Genesis chapter 15,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:50.059
if you take and turn over there, if you will,

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.980
and then eventually we'll get to Psalm 147.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.019
But notice in Genesis 15,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.420
this is the understanding of this covenant

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.980
that God would make with Abram.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.380
His name would soon in a few chapters be changed to Abraham.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.299
But at this particular time in history, His name is Abram.

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:06.739
And the Bible says in verse number one,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.579
after these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abram

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.820
in a vision saying, fear not Abram.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.940
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.299
By the way, that's a great entrance, is it not?

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:19.899
When God says, fear not,

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.619
the girls just sang about not having any fear.

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:25.779
And we see that the Bible says to Abram to fear not,

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.940
if you understand the context of chapter 14

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.380
and why there might be reason for fear

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.140
because of that coalition of armies that was defeated

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.059
and how Lot was rescued by Abram and so on and so forth,

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.260
that God shows up and says, hey, Abram, don't fear.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.100
Why?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.100
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:46.380
Notice in verse number two,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.980
that Abram then says to the Lord, he says, Lord God,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.459
what will thou give me seeing I go childless?

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.579
The steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.739
And Abram said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:04.660
and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.339
This was his logic.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.579
This was his reason on how God might use Eleazar

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.140
to be his heir.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.019
But we find that God responds in verse number four

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:17.459
and says, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.459
saying, this shall not be thine heir,

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.619
but he that shall come forth out of thine own mouth

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:24.579
shall be thine heir.

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.700
And then notice this in verse number five.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.059
And he brought him forth abroad.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:35.059
God brings Abram out and says, look now toward heaven.

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.380
And tell the stars.

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:42.700
Genesis one, the Bible says that he made the stars also.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.619
And as God is giving this promise to Abram,

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.779
he takes him out in the night and he says to Abram,

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:53.779
he says, look toward heaven and tell the stars.

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.899
Notice what he says, if thou be able to number them.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.339
Have you ever tried to count the stars?

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.739
Honestly, I never have.

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:06.779
I've never tried.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.779
I know some that have.

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:14.459
When I was about 13 years old,

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:16.500
I went walking out of my house.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.899
We lived in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:22.579
The neighbor that lived on this corner,

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:24.859
there was a road in between our house and their house.

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:27.260
They had three children, two daughters and a son.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.220
The son was the oldest, I don't remember his name.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.299
But I remember walking out one night, early evening,

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:34.739
and I walked out and he was standing

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:38.220
in the middle of his front yard and he was doing this.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.019
And I thought, what is that guy doing?

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:40.940
He's crazy.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:43.700
And I walked over there and I called him by name

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.540
and said, what are you doing?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.500
He said, you made me lose count.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.339
I said, count of what?

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:52.179
He said, I was counting the stars.

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:53.100
You're doing what?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.859
But notice what God says.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.619
So shall thy seed be.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.260
God is giving, using his creation to reinforce a promise

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.779
that God has given to Abram.

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:16.820
And he says to Abram, look toward heaven.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.140
You see all those stars out there?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.100
Are you able to number them?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.380
Of course he cannot.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.980
We find that God would use his creation

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.859
to reinforce this promise.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.660
And the Bible says that Abram, in verse number six,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.099
that he believed in the Lord.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.219
He counted it to him for righteousness.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:38.940
Oh, isn't that wonderful to see the faith of Abram?

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.780
Many of us this morning would be familiar

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.099
with the declaration of the psalmist in Psalm 19

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.859
in verse number one, where the Bible says,

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:47.380
the heavens declare the glory of God

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.020
and the firmament showeth his handiwork.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:52.979
This morning as we sit here

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.900
and I've asked the question already,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.059
have you ever tried to count the number of stars?

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:59.780
The reality is that none of us would be capable

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.140
of counting the number of stars.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.179
It's beyond our ability.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.219
In fact, with all of the advancement in technology

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:08.739
and all of the things that exist,

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:10.859
we find that even still today,

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:13.340
that scientists are only able to offer us

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.419
with an estimate as to how many stars

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.119
are actually in the universe.

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.820
The number of stars that they estimate

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.659
to be in our universe is this, 200 billion trillion.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.659
I mean, I don't even know how you think about it.

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:30.739
Honestly, when I think about that number,

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:33.679
my mind cannot wrap around that number.

00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:40.219
200 billion trillion is the estimate

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:42.659
as to how many stars are in our universe.

00:09:44.219 --> 00:09:47.419
You think about that number and you find

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:52.179
that that number is huge, beyond my ability,

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.219
at least, to comprehend.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.299
How many zeros is that?

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:56.580
I have no idea.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.900
I mean, scientific notation.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.820
is needed for that, amen, because it's something to some big power, right?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.780
I don't even know how many zeros there are.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:15.880
But the reality is that with that many estimated to be that number of stars in our universe,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:25.980
do you know, not including our sun, that the next closest star to earth is 25.3 trillion

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.980
miles away?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:37.900
25.3 trillion miles, four and a half or so light years away, is the next closest star

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.020
to earth.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.820
That's phenomenal to me.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:50.100
And God simply says in Genesis, He made the stars also.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.700
It's important for us to understand this morning that God did not make the stars so that mankind

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.740
would worship the stars.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.940
Now we understand that there's a segment of human population throughout the centuries

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.540
that have worshipped the heavenlies, that have worshipped the stars, and that is not

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.300
in any way, shape or form, the reason that God created the stars.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:17.540
In fact, He tells us there in Genesis why He did, but I find as we look at Psalm 147,

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.580
that rather than man worshipping the stars, we find that God created the stars in order

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:31.580
to demonstrate His great power and His infinite wisdom, so that man would worship the Creator.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.100
That we'd understand how great He is.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.140
It's interesting as we look at Psalm 147 this morning and examine these few verses of Scripture,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.420
the Bible begins in verse number one, really our text will be verses three through six,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.300
but let me read verse number one as we get into it.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.980
The Bible says, praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.380
it is pleasant, and praise is comely.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.060
Oh, how important it is that we praise our God.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.060
By the way, we have much to praise Him for.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.700
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the outcast of Israel, He healeth

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.740
the broken and hardened, bindeth up their wounds, He telleth the number of the stars,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.460
He calleth them all by their names.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.980
Great is our Lord and of great power, His understanding is infinite.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.220
The Lord lifteth up the meek, He casteth the wicked down to the ground.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.140
I want to focus our attention this morning on verses three through six here from Psalm

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.140
147.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:32.260
If you're taking notes, number one, I want you to note the powerful proclamation.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.940
In verses four and five, God gives us this powerful proclamation and it really deals

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.640
with His power and His wisdom.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.220
We mention as we look at Psalm 19 about the heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.620
showeth His handiwork.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.780
As we look there in Genesis chapter one that He made the stars also, we find that the psalmist

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.460
now again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, begins to reference the stars

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.180
in verses four and five.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.260
Then we find this powerful proclamation is given to us with regard to the stars, God's

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:08.180
creation, and notice first of all in verse number four, the Bible says this, He, God,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:14.340
the Lord, the one that's to be praised in verse number one, He telleth the number of

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.340
the stars.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.060
Listen, God doesn't have to give an estimate.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.420
He knows exactly how many stars there are.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:30.380
He does not have to wonder as our scientists have given us these estimates of 200 billion

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.380
trillion.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.940
No, God knows precisely exactly the number of stars.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.340
The Bible declares to us that He telleth the number of the stars, but He stood before Abram

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.980
and He says, Abram, look up to heaven and see if you can tell the number of stars.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.780
Abram's just a man.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.980
He's like we are, flesh and blood.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:57.760
Just as we can relate to Abram and say with Abram, no, it is impossible for me to number

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:06.240
the stars, but God, He telleth the number of them, of the stars.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.900
Notice in this powerful proclamation, not only does God tell us that He knows the number

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.800
of the stars, but it's amazing in the end of verse number four, the Bible says this,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.880
He calleth them, the stars, all by their names.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.200
Isn't that amazing?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:36.600
He knoweth the number of the stars and He calleth them all by their names.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.320
This is absolutely fascinating to me when I consider the infinite wisdom and the great

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.080
power of our God and He says in Genesis one, He made the stars also, but He knows how many

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.800
He made and He gave each of them a name.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.880
This is phenomenal.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.320
How many names do you think you know?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.760
How many people do you think within your circle that you know?

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.400
I mean, maybe a couple of hundred, maybe more for certain people, right?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.680
But the reality, have you ever forgotten somebody's name?

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.680
Miss Mariah and Mana were walking out of church last Sunday night and I looked straight at

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.760
Mariah and called her Mana and she, Mana was standing right next to her, but I called her

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.520
and I said, man, I'm sorry, Mariah, I know your name is Mariah.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.560
I'm normally pretty good with names and I'm not saying that to pat myself on the back,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.320
I really work on it, I try to be careful with it, I try to learn people's names.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:37.040
Cole over here, man, I was messed up thinking his name was Connor because he looks like

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.680
my niece's boyfriend in Texas, Connor.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.820
He looks just like him, not just like him, but close.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.600
And I knew it started with a C and man, every time I'd see him walk in, I'm like, what is

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600
his name?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.280
I know it's not Cole, I mean, I know it's not Connor, but that's what I want to call

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
him.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.460
And so I finally put him aside one day and I said, listen, just remind me of your name.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.080
And I don't think I've forgotten since.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.800
I try to, but sometimes we forget people's names, right?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:14.600
Two hundred billion trillion is the estimate of man as to the number of stars.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:22.400
God knows exactly how many there are and He calls them all by their name.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.280
That's phenomenal to me.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:32.680
Now this great, powerful proclamation of Psalm 147 in verse number four is followed up in

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:39.040
verse number five by revealing to us and helping us understand what God is seeking to communicate

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.580
to us as His creation with this reference to the stars.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.280
It is this, number one, He is great.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.800
Notice in verse number five, great is our Lord.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.880
I mean, how else do you walk away from the powerful proclamation of verse number four

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.200
without or with any other response than God's great?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:10.400
I mean, that's the immediate response, great is our Lord, notice, and of great power.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.840
Yes, we mentioned last week the power of God.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:24.280
And the psalmist continues and says, His understanding is infinite.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.600
His understanding is infinite.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.680
And so when we begin to notice this powerful proclamation in Psalm 147 verses four and

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.560
five, we see that He knows exactly the number of stars and He has given all of them a name

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:45.520
and He knows them, He calls them by their names, reveals to us that He's a great God,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.800
He has great power, and that His understanding is infinite.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.680
But I want you to understand this morning that this powerful proclamation is sandwiched

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.760
in between some precious promises.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.720
And if you're taking notes, the second thought this morning is consider the precious promises.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.840
We find that verse four and five, this great proclamation of our God and His power and

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.760
His wisdom, His understanding, and we can understand that He transcends us, His power

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:27.840
and His knowledge is so far greater than anything we could even begin to comprehend.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.240
But this truth is sandwiched between some precious promises that God is giving to us

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.520
as the crown of His creation, mankind.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.160
Next week, I'm going to preach and it's on the front of our bulletin this week, so we're

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.080
a week off, but it says, I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.119
I'm going to preach a message on that very title next week, I am fearfully and wonderfully

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:54.119
made.

00:18:54.119 --> 00:19:00.400
I say we're a week off just joking on that, we don't create the bulletins, they just come

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.040
in and we use them and I saw them and Holly got done printing them and I said, oh, that's

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.400
my title for my message next week.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.840
But anyhow, I want you to notice these precious promises.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:20.860
The all-powerful, all-wise God who spoke the world into existence, who knows the number

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:32.220
of stars, who calls them all by their name, is concerned about you as an individual.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:40.660
With all the wonder and the beauty of creation, with all that we see and we can look into

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:47.260
the heavenlies and we can see the power, the glory, the work of our God, we understand

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:55.420
that He is concerned about you, He's concerned about me, He's concerned about us as individuals.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.340
Do you think this morning that if He knows the stars by name?

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.020
Have you considered that He knows your name?

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.540
Isn't that precious?

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:12.740
There's a song last week, Brianna and Joseph sang, in the middle of my storm, the same

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.620
fella that wrote that song sang another song, I didn't write the song, but He knows my name.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.220
And some of you may have heard that song at some point, but He knows my name.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.580
Listen, I'm so thankful that He knows my name and that He knows your name because He's concerned

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.580
with us as individuals.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.340
Now let's consider these promises, let's note them here in verses 3 and verse number 6.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.580
There are three of them and they're so precious.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:44.020
Notice in verse number 3, the first of these three promises, the Bible says this, He healeth

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.020
the broken in heart.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.860
He healeth the broken in heart.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.340
This same God who knows the number of the stars, the same God who calls them all by

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:03.020
their names, this God that is great in power, that His understanding is infinite, that for

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:11.100
us as His people, His creation, He says this, that He healeth the broken in heart.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.940
Oh, that's a precious truth of the Word of God.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.780
I want you to understand this morning that God does not say in Psalm 147 and verse number

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:27.100
3, He does not say that you would not have a broken heart.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:34.100
He says that He healeth the broken in heart, and that ought to be precious to us.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.420
See, there are times in our lives where perhaps we go around and we think that we're never

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.340
going to have a broken heart, we're never going to have this difficulty, we're never

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.620
going to experience this hardship, but God, the God who said He made the stars also, the

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.620
one who knows their number, and He calls them by their name, He says, listen, I understand

00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:00.380
that as an individual at some point you might have a broken heart, but He healeth the broken

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.380
heart.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.460
Oh, that's so precious to me.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.440
And I hold it dear, why?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.860
Because we are frail people.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.620
God knows our frame, He's made us and He knows what we're made of, and He knows what we endure,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.020
and He knows what we go through, and He knows that there are times that we might have a

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:25.820
broken heart, but He heals.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:34.620
Do you not think this morning that the God who spoke it all into creation, the God who

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:39.060
the Bible says He made the stars also, that He knoweth their number and He calls them

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:46.020
by name, do you think this morning that He doesn't know about your condition?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.820
He knows, listen, if you have a broken heart this morning, God knows it, and the wonderful

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.500
thing is not just that God knows that you have a broken heart, but the precious truth

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:04.700
of the Word of God is that the Bible says that He healeth the broken in heart.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:13.180
We do not need to be shamed or shameful if we have a time in which our heart is overwhelmed,

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.500
a time in which we would say our heart is breaking over the things that we're dealing

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.400
with.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.580
We need not pretend, we need not to put on a facade, we need not to act as if we got

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.420
it all under control, no, we go to the One who heals the broken heart, and that's such

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.700
a precious truth of the Word of God.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.820
Turn back if you will, keep your place here, we'll be back in just a moment, but turn to

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:47.340
the book of…we're in the book of Psalms, turn to Psalm 61.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.700
So many of the Psalms are so precious to us.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.660
I mentioned to you a few Sunday nights ago that I'm going to, by God's grace and with

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.740
God's help, in addition to reading through the Scriptures this year, I'm going to read

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.580
the book of Psalms and Proverbs each month.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.900
I've already been so encouraged and so blessed.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.380
Psalm 61 begins, we look at the Psalms and we see how the psalmist is so transparent.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:20.260
Hear my cry, O God, attend unto my prayer.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.420
From the end of the earth will I cry unto Thee.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:28.820
Notice what he says, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:40.500
You say, I don't know, my heart's overwhelmed, I'm just not…you're human, it happens.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:47.300
There are times in which our hearts are broken, but how we rejoice in understanding even what

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.980
the psalmist says here in Psalm 61, that when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.660
that is higher than I, that we find that the psalmist tells us here in Psalm 147 in verse

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.820
number 3, he healeth the broken in heart.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.180
Oh, this morning.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.460
We know people that have broken hearts.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.340
You say, pastor, I'm one of them.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.620
Maybe you are, you know.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:23.540
You're going through something this morning, a season, whatever it might be.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.540
Maybe you know someone.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:31.540
Man, I don't know how people do it without Jesus, honestly.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:39.460
I don't know how people do it without Jesus, because we face some difficulties in life.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:46.140
We face a troubled time, but isn't it wonderful to know that our God reigns?

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:51.860
Isn't it wonderful to know the one that heals the broken heart?

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:58.500
And again, sandwiched in between these promises is the fact that he knows the number of the

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500
stars.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500
He calls them by their name.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.500
He's great in power.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500
He's great.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
He's great in power.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.420
His understanding is infinite.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.540
And it helps me because I understand that, listen, if he's able to do all of that, that

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.620
powerful proclamation in verse 4 and 5, if he's able to do all of that with regard to

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.060
creation and all of the stars and all of his power and his wisdom, then certainly he has

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:27.740
the ability to heal my broken heart and to heal your broken heart and to give you what

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:33.180
you need in the moment of what you're going through.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.500
But it's God that heals the broken heart.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.900
Sometimes we look for someone else to heal the broken heart.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.980
We think some other circumstance or some other thing is going to heal our broken heart, but

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.540
it is God who makes the proclamation.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.940
He makes this precious promise that it is He that healeth the broken heart.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:59.540
Oh, this morning, I hope that you would take great comfort in this first promise.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.540
But he continues.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:10.940
Notice again in verse number 3, the Bible says this, and bindeth up their wounds.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.100
He bindeth up their wounds.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.500
The word wounds means sorrow, pain, or hurt.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:22.180
The word bindeth literally carries with it the context of a, of bandaging something.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.380
And I want you to, in your mind this morning, get this picture where the Bible says that

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:32.020
He, God, the Lord, the one who created the stars, the one who knows their number that

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.340
calls them by their names, that He binds your wounds.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.740
Again, as I mentioned in the first promise, again here we find that He does not say that

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.980
your life will be free from wounds.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:54.420
Rather, He says that He bindeth up their wounds.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.220
I think about the little child.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.940
I think about our children.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.620
I think about when I was a child.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.300
I think about our children.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:10.260
You think about the times in which they would get hurt, learning to ride a bike.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.060
That's always a difficult time in life, isn't it?

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.300
Trying to get a child to learn how to ride a bike, and get to that point where you're

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.940
going to take those training wheels off, right?

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.940
And what's going to happen?

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.700
You better have a good supply of Band-Aids, right?

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.820
Have any of you, you remember your kids learn how to ride a bike, or maybe your kids are

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.900
in that stage of learning to ride a bike?

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.220
We have some in church that like Band-Aids a whole lot.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.940
I see them with Band-Aids on all the time, right?

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:42.900
There's something about riding the bike, and skinning up your knees, right?

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.460
And it happens, your elbows, and all sorts of things.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.740
See, back when I was a kid learning how to do it, they didn't have all these knee pads,

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.660
elbow pads, and all this helmet stuff.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.660
Man, you just had to rub some dirt on it and get over it, you know?

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.660
Like just whatever.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.220
And my dad, he just said amen.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.460
He was not the person I went to when I had a wound that had to be bound up, amen?

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.380
And he took my thunder already.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:12.300
But the reality is that when our kids were going through those stages, they'd fall and

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.580
they'd cut up their knee, or their hand, or their elbow.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.380
You know who they'd come running to?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.820
Holly, mom.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:32.700
And they'd be crying, and it would be almost just beyond the ability to calm them down.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:39.900
And Holly would calmly take them into the bathroom, try to get them cleaned up, bandage

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.900
that wound.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.580
You know when all of a sudden it starts happening to that child?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.860
They're calm.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.740
Why?

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:58.900
Because someone who loves them is binding up, bandaging their wounds.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.420
And maybe...

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.420
moms from time to time have other means of helping calm

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.060
and soothe their children.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.500
Let's go get a popsicle, a cookie, a something, right?

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.660
And man, it just seems to make everything better.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.580
We understand that physically speaking,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.140
that we understand the idea of having a wound,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.020
having something that someone then bandages up

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.780
and provides that comfort for us that we need

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.020
and helps us to heal that thing up.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.420
But we look at the word of God and the Bible says,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.780
not only does God heal the broken in heart,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.320
but he says that he bindeth up their wounds.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.380
You say, pastor, I have some pains, I have some hurts,

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.220
I have some sorrow, then rejoice in knowing

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.200
that God binds them up.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.240
Oh, what a joy, what a blessing.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.240
Why didn't my children come to me?

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.480
Maybe I was not as compassionate.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.480
Why did I go to my mom and not to my dad?

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.140
Because he was not as compassionate.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.560
You ever have a thought that you broke something?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.620
You know what my dad would do?

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.640
Tim, stand up for just a minute.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.720
I'd tell him I thought I broke my arm, he'd say,

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.760
nah, it's good.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.820
That's how it works sometimes.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.560
But God is compassionate.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.960
God is full of grace and mercy.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.080
And he knows what your wounds are.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.440
He knows what your hurts are.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.880
He knows that if you're carrying that load,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.480
he knows and he tells us, he gives us this precious promise

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.880
that he bindeth up their wounds.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.080
I'm so thankful that I don't have to just live life

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.200
with my wounds.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.760
Again, he didn't say that we'd never have wounds.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.400
He says that he would bind them up.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.480
They don't have to stay as open wounds.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.960
They don't have to become infected wounds.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.200
You know what happens when they stay open

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.120
and they become infected?

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.440
Starts to impact other areas of your life.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.440
Spiritually, we're speaking now.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.080
We see it physically.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.160
You gotta deal with the wounds.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.720
You gotta deal with them.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.560
You gotta medicate them.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.720
You gotta make sure infection doesn't set in, right?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.400
There are times in which people have wounds

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.640
and doctors will put marks on their arms

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.760
to see where the infection has spread to

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.680
and they need to come back.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.240
And if it passes this line, that stuff happens.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.120
But can I tell you what happens in our hearts

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.760
and our lives when we have wounds

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.760
and we don't go to the one that binds up the wounds?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.680
We get bitter.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.680
We get bitter.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.080
And bitterness destroys.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.600
When we get bitter, no longer are we able to be in a place

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.800
where we're used of God for his honor and for his glory.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.340
We get so focused on ourselves and we're so angry

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.120
at whoever it was that hurt us and whatever took place

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.480
and whatever those wounds are.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.120
And we're just bitter.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.280
Someone said this, it's not original with me,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.400
but bitterness destroys the vessel in which it's stored

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.940
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.240
The reality this morning is that when wounds

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.520
are not addressed and taken care of,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.740
it can cause this root of bitterness.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.480
Aren't you thankful this morning

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.560
that though we experience wounds in our lives,

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.280
that they don't have to go as open wounds.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.520
They don't have to become infected wounds.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.360
Why?

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.760
Because our God, the Bible says,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.660
that he bindeth up their wounds.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.760
You say, oh, you don't know how deeply hurt I am.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.720
Remember, he spoke and it was so.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.080
The Bible says he made the stars also.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.240
He knows their number.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.560
He calls them by name.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.880
You're gonna tell me that you have a wound

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.000
that he can't heal?

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.160
Come on.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.280
He bindeth up their wounds.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.880
Notice verse number six,

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.860
the third promise that is given to us.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.240
The powerful proclamation is verses four and five,

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.480
but these precious promises by which

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.240
we receive great comfort this morning,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.240
I hope that we're encouraged this morning.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.000
He healeth the broken in heart.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.280
He bindeth up their wounds.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.840
Notice in verse number six,

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.760
the Lord lifteth up the meek.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.660
The word lifteth up literally means to restore.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.520
The word meek is used in a variety of contexts

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.760
throughout the Bible.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.520
Some have looked at meek and looked at it

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.600
as being weakness, and not always

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.680
is it looked at in that frame.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.000
Power under control is a great way to define meekness.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.640
Meekness in the New Testament,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.680
when you look at the fruit of the spirit,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.720
it's akin to gentleness.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.640
We find here that in the context

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.540
that's talking about this one that's meek,

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.780
that's cast down, and all of that that's taking place,

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.200
and all of these things that have really taken place

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.720
in the life of this individual,

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.480
but the Bible says that the Lord,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.520
the same God who spoke it all into existence,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.000
the one that made the stars also,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.280
that knows their number, that calls them by their names,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.280
that he lifteth up the meek that he restores.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.480
This morning, as we look at these precious promises,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.320
and we consider them for just a few moments this morning,

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.920
I hope that our hearts would be encouraged.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.580
I hope that we would receive great comfort

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.960
from the God who is the God of all comfort.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.320
That we understand that though we live in this world,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.180
that we will endure hurt, and we will have times

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.840
of brokenheartedness, and wounds,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.040
and times that we're overwhelmed,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.040
that God heals, and he binds, and he lifts, he restores.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:29.440
I mentioned that this, our God,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.880
who knows the number of the stars,

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.960
who calls them all by their names,

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.360
that he's interested in us as individuals.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.560
His greatest concern for us is our salvation.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.840
It's his greatest concern for us.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.080
This morning, I'm thankful for the promises

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.820
that we find in verse three and verse number six.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.640
But you know the greatest work

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.240
that God's ever done in my life is saving my soul.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.880
And I believe this morning that if you're here,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.320
and you've trusted Christ as your savior,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.600
that you too would testify that the greatest work

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.800
he's ever done in your life is saving your soul.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.720
See, he's not willing that any should perish,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.780
but that all should come to repentance.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.520
He's given us the plan of redemption in his word

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.320
that mankind can only be saved

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.640
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.440
There's no other name under heaven given among men

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.580
whereby we must be saved.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.080
The precious, wonderful name of Jesus.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.880
It's not by works of righteousness which we have done.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.920
It's not by some religion that we've held to.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.040
It's all through the work of Jesus Christ

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.820
on the cross of Calvary.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.060
His death, his burial, and his glorious resurrection.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.280
It's Jesus alone.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.000
It's not grace plus works.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.360
It's not grace and anything else.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.960
It's just Jesus.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.920
And this morning, as the people of God,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.500
if you're here this morning and you've been saved

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.080
by the blood of Christ, oh, you should rejoice.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.400
But though we've been saved by the,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.480
and if you've not been saved by the blood of Christ,

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.760
if you've not, if you don't know,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.680
if you don't have that assurance,

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.280
you're trying to get to heaven on your own some way,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.180
through some church or through some other work,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.400
oh, come to Christ.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.240
He died for you.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.060
He loves you.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.280
He knows you individually.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.960
And he died for you.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.280
But for those of us that know Christ as our Savior,

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.120
oh, those of us that know that he is the creator,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.240
the truth that we find this powerful proclamation

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.400
in verses four and five, yes,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.560
should cause us to stand in awe of who he is.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.200
And we should have the same response as the psalmist has,

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.040
great is the Lord and of great power.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.440
And his understanding is infinite.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.880
But understand this morning

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.840
that this powerful proclamation

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.280
in verses four and five of Psalm 147

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.800
is sandwiched in between

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.740
some precious promises for God's people.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.280
And those precious promises

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.560
that he healeth the broken in heart,

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.060
that he bindeth up their wounds,

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.160
that he lifteth up the meek,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.680
that the same God who has promised to do that for you

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.640
made the stars also.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.280
He calls them all by their names.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.440
He knows their number.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.640
See, it's kind of like,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.600
and the reason that I went to Genesis 15,

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.140
it's kind of like Abram.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.320
You ever have your own logic and your own reason?

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.400
Abram did.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.200
Abram said, God, I'm having a child.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.960
You promised me a seed.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.720
God, can this Eliezer, maybe he'd be the heir?

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.840
God says, no, no, Abram, that's not my plan.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.600
God says, listen, I'm going to illustrate.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.940
Come on out here, look up toward the heaven, see all those stars, can you tell the number

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.940
of them?

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.880
Of course not.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.800
He says, so shall thy seed be.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:28.120
This morning, God says to you and He says to me, He made the stars also.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.840
He knows their number.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:37.160
He calls them all by their names, but He says, I know that my people, they have broken hearts.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.320
I know that my people have wounds.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:47.120
I know that they face difficulties and hardships, but I'm the God who heals the broken heart.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.600
That's what God says.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.400
I'm the God who bindeth up their wounds.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.080
Can you see God's mercy and His compassion?

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:06.840
Like the mother and the child, binding up your wounds, literally to bandage.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.640
He says, I lift up, I restore the meek.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:20.960
Maybe this morning, you say to the Lord, Lord, You know my heart and You know what I'm going

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.960
through.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:27.440
God, I know who You are, I know that You've created all these things and God, I'm going

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.200
to claim these promises.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.320
Maybe you have a wound.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.160
Maybe you've got a wound that's been neglected, it's not been tended to.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.720
You've allowed it to just kind of be open and fester and become infected, if I could

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.000
use that terminology this morning.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.280
Maybe you need to let God bind up, bandage that wound because it's just destroying you

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.840
Maybe this morning, say, Lord, I need to be restored.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.520
He lifteth up the meek.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:12.400
I'm not sure what it is this morning, but I know that the Creator God, who knows the

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:19.920
number and the names of the stars, He knows you as an individual and He loves you and

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:26.840
He knows what you're going through and He says, I can take care of that.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.400
I can handle that, but we've got to let Him.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.400
We've got to come to Him.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.960
That's why the psalmist says, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960
higher than I.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:44.400
Oh, that I would not just try to figure it out myself, try to resolve the matter.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:51.560
No, no, God, You're the one that heals and binds and lifts.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.640
Let Him have His way.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.800
Let Him do what only He can do.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.000
Aren't they some precious promises?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.360
I mean, it's a powerful proclamation of what God has done with the stars, knowing their

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.760
number and their name, but what's more precious to me than He cares about me, He cares about

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760
you.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.840
He heals, He binds, and He lifts.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.840
Let's pray.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.320
Lord, we love You this morning and we thank You for loving us.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:39.080
Lord, I don't know, but I take great comfort in knowing that You know every circumstance

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:47.720
and situation that every person, under the sound of my voice, is dealing with today.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.320
God, You did not promise that we'd have no broken hearts.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.440
You did not promise that we'd have no wounds, but You promised that You heal and that You

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440
bind.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.440
Oh, I'm so thankful.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.840
I praise You and I rejoice in You.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.360
Thank You for the testimony of the psalmist.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.480
I thank You for the work You've done in my life over the years.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:24.820
God, I pray this morning, in the time of invitation, as we reflect upon that which we've heard

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:30.440
and we respond to that which we've received from Your Word, as we allow the Holy Spirit

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:36.020
of God to have His will and way in our lives, I pray this morning, God, that we'd respond

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.900
in faith, in obedience, in brokenness.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:47.300
God, I don't know the needs, but I'm thankful that You do.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:56.180
And God, I pray that You would work in such a way that You alone would be glorified.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.820
We pray that in these few moments of invitation, there's one that's not sure of heaven.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.420
Oh, God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:10.180
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure, 100% certainty that heaven is their

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.780
home.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:18.380
I pray that no one would leave this place with a broken heart or a wound, but God, we'd

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:24.460
allow You to heal and bind, lift us up.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.500
I pray that You'd be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
