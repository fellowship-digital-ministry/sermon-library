1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Revelation, unlike Brother Hummel this morning

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,559
that kept talking about Revelation,

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,239
well, he's in 1 Thessalonians and 2 Timothy,

4
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:09,359
and he was so excited to hear about

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,960
we're studying through the book of Revelation,

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,119
he just wanted to go ahead and preach from it

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,779
for Sunday school and Sunday morning,

8
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,760
although he was not really in the book,

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,239
but we certainly had some good fellowship with them.

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,559
They extend their gratitude to the church family,

11
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,020
and they just absolutely love being here with us,

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,879
and we love having them with us as well.

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,599
The book of Revelation, wow, what a great study,

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,840
and I am certainly thankful for the opportunity

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,060
to have a Bible, to have the whole canon of Scripture.

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,040
I'm thankful that God has given us this book of Revelation.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,080
I'll say this, there's much interest

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,279
surrounding the book of Revelation.

19
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,779
It is the final book in our Bible,

20
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:53,020
and I would say that it's a fascinating book to study.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,779
As we look through this book of Revelation,

22
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,580
and we consider the content of the book,

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,380
we find that there have been volumes of books

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,860
written throughout the ages in order to try to explain

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,459
various elements of this book,

26
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,819
and there are volumes of just books

27
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,339
that have been written on prophecy, on end times,

28
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,419
on the book of Revelation specifically,

29
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,480
and we understand that there's much interest

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,059
with regard to the book of Revelation.

31
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:23,339
I believe that it's important

32
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,019
as we start our study this evening

33
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,980
that we establish some principles, if you will,

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,419
that will guide our study through the book of Revelation.

35
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm gonna give you a number of thoughts here

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,940
just by way of introduction

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,860
before we get into the message tonight

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,779
on just principles that are important for us to remember,

39
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,339
not only when we study the book of Revelation,

40
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,900
when we study any book of the Bible,

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,300
but specifically with regard to the book of Revelation

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,180
because of the amount of interest

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,739
and the number of things that have been written

44
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,620
and spoken about, videos, et cetera,

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,660
I think these are important principles and guidelines

46
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,319
for us to be mindful of.

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,819
Number one is this, the book of Revelation is scripture.

48
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,419
It is God's word.

49
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:10,419
It's not man's word, it is God's word,

50
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,539
and it's important for us to understand that.

51
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,139
I preached on Wednesday evening

52
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,539
doing what we ought to do, that we ought to listen up,

53
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,339
and I said that when we approach the Bible,

54
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,940
it's important that we approach the Bible

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,600
with the understanding that it is God's word.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,279
It's not man's word, it is authoritative,

57
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,320
and the Bible tells us that all scripture

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,600
is given by inspiration of God and is profitable,

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,360
and so when we're mindful of the fact

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,199
that the book of Revelation is scripture

61
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,399
and that it is given to us by God

62
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,679
and that it is profitable,

63
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:44,360
it causes us to approach the book

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,360
understanding that God has a purpose for us in this book,

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,440
and we'll deal with that a little bit

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
as we get into the message this evening.

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,720
Number two, we must interpret the scriptures literally,

68
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,360
and this is a huge issue,

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,080
especially when we begin to deal

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
with the book of Revelation specifically.

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,600
There's a lot of comparison speech

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,759
that you'll read throughout the book of Revelation.

73
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,639
You'll use the English words that are used,

74
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,839
like, as, as it were,

75
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,000
and it's important that we understand

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,039
that as we're interpreting the book of Revelation,

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
that we're interpreting the book literally.

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,479
I'll say this as well, number three,

79
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,919
symbolism is used heavily throughout the book of Revelation,

80
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,839
and we understand that symbolism is used.

81
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,800
In fact, in verse number one,

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,399
it says, and he sent and signified it by his angel

83
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:43,039
unto the servant John, unto his servant John,

84
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,179
and we see that idea of signified symbols

85
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,240
and signs and what have you,

86
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,160
and there's much symbolism in the book of Revelation,

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,960
but we must be careful that,

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
though there's much symbolism in the book,

89
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,639
that we do not over-spiritualize

90
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,360
or allegorize what God has said,

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
and so we have to be really careful of that

92
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
because symbols, we need to be careful

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
not to just let our minds grow,

94
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,320
you know, and develop some thoughts and what have you.

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,839
With that, number four,

96
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,480
we must compare scripture with scripture,

97
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,600
and it's absolutely vital.

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,279
In fact, many of the symbols that are used

99
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,720
in the book of Revelation,

100
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
other portions of scripture unlock those symbols for us,

101
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,679
and it's not for us to just simply try to figure out

102
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,760
what does this symbol mean,

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,920
but we have the scripture, the whole canon of scripture,

104
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,260
that helps us to be able to interpret

105
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,160
the symbols that are used,

106
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,140
and so that symbolism that is used,

107
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,119
we still must take the truth of 1 Peter

108
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,119
that we interpret scripture with scripture,

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,739
and so we have to deal with that.

110
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:55,640
Let me say this.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,119
The book of Revelation, there's some arguments,

112
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:02,239
and I haven't read it in the sense

113
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,480
of trying to take every verse

114
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,399
and find a counterpart in the Old Testament,

115
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,160
but I'm told from what I read

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,260
that there are between 300 and 500 references

117
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,480
in the book of Revelation to the Old Testament, okay?

118
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,480
So what that means is 70% of the verses

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,559
in the book of Revelation have some reference

120
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,519
to an Old Testament passage of scripture.

121
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,720
Now, think about that.

122
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,279
How's somebody gonna be able to understand

123
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,679
and interpret the book of Revelation

124
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,519
if they don't read the Old Testament?

125
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,519
You understand what I'm saying?

126
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,959
See, sometimes what happens, I hear it so often,

127
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,880
that we have this view of the Old Testament

128
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,660
as we're New Testament believers,

129
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,579
we're New Testament Christians,

130
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,899
we don't really need it, it's not really necessary.

131
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,179
It unlocks the scripture for us,

132
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:57,179
and God has providentially preserved it for us.

133
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,260
I was told of an individual

134
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,540
that's actually studying for the ministry

135
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,660
in Bible college, studying for the ministry.

136
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,220
I received this firsthand, studying in the ministry,

137
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,540
and they had this opinion of the Old Testament.

138
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,980
Now, I didn't understand the verbiage because I'm 44,

139
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,779
so I had to get some interpretation

140
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,000
from a younger generation as to what it meant,

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,739
but they said this, that the Old Testament is just mid,

142
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,339
right, that was the word that they used,

143
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,739
meaning it's just kinda, eh, take it or leave it,

144
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:31,859
like, eh, it's just, no, no, no, it's scripture.

145
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,420
It's God's word, and here's the problem.

146
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,459
If we wanna go and understand the book of Revelation,

147
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,899
and we have a wrong view of the Old Testament,

148
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,779
but 70% of the verses in the book of Revelation

149
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,220
have a reference to the Old Testament,

150
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,920
we're never gonna be able to properly understand

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,700
the book of Revelation if we ignore the Old Testament,

152
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,660
and so it's absolutely vital,

153
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
and so that's an important principle

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,480
that we interpret scripture with scripture.

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,799
Let me say this.

156
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,420
God said what he said,

157
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,739
and he means what he says, okay?

158
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,220
God is the all-wise God.

159
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,700
It bothers me when somebody goes to the Bible and says,

160
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,500
well, God actually meant to say this.

161
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,019
No, no, no, no, no, no, he's God.

162
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,899
God said exactly what he wanted to say,

163
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,579
and so when we come to the book of Revelation,

164
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,820
and we begin to read and study

165
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,059
through the book of Revelation,

166
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,859
it's not to allow our minds to wander as to,

167
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,260
oh, I wonder how this could be,

168
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,940
or what this, and so on and so forth.

169
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,899
No, no, God said what he said, and he means what he says,

170
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,700
and it's important that we understand that.

171
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,660
Let me say this along with that thought.

172
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,380
Number six, where God is silent,

173
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,899
we must be careful not to add our opinions.

174
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,059
You know there's some places that God is silent?

175
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,420
What do I mean by that?

176
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,700
He gives us some truth,

177
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,380
and he doesn't maybe explain every detail

178
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,299
with regard to he knows what we need,

179
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,579
and he gave us what we need,

180
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,359
and so there are places,

181
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,619
especially in the book of Revelation,

182
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,600
where there are some areas

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,019
where God is silent on some things,

184
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,019
and it is important that we do not try to fill in

185
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,019
those areas with our own opinions,

186
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,940
or reading some commentary,

187
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,220
and reading some theologian's opinion

188
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,420
of what should be there.

189
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,320
No, we gotta be careful.

190
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,559
If God was silent on it,

191
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,619
then I guess that means we didn't need to know it,

192
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,760
and we just trust God, and we carry on,

193
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,059
and so that's an important thing for us to understand,

194
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,739
and I hope all of these will make sense

195
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,900
as we get through the whole message this morning,

196
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,739
this evening.

197
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,099
I wanna say this, number seven,

198
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,020
there are alternating scenes

199
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,700
throughout the book of Revelation,

200
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,619
and it's important for us to understand

201
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,419
that as we read the book of Revelation,

202
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,219
as we study through the book of Revelation,

203
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,900
that there are alternating scenes.

204
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
In other words, there are times

205
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,679
when we're reading through the book of Revelation

206
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,340
that the scene is Earth,

207
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,299
but then there are times

208
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,419
that we're reading the book of Revelation,

209
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,539
and the scene is Heaven,

210
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,179
and if we're not careful of being mindful

211
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,059
of which scene we're reading about,

212
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,539
is this an event that's taking place on Earth,

213
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,619
or is this an event that's taking place in Heaven,

214
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:13,780
we can get kinda messed up in our interpreting

215
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,780
because we're not understanding the alternating scenes

216
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,940
that God gives us in the book of Revelation,

217
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,760
and so it's important.

218
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,700
I've preached from Revelation chapter four and five

219
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,539
over the years.

220
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,820
I've read in some messages,

221
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,419
I think one even this year,

222
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,460
the entirety of chapter five of the book of Revelation

223
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,500
to conclude one of our morning services,

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,340
and the reason,

225
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,700
what a view that God gives us in Revelation five

226
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,500
of the throne room of Heaven.

227
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,659
I mean, it's amazing.

228
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,099
It causes us to wanna worship.

229
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,739
It's awesome,

230
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,780
and so we have to be mindful of these alternating scenes

231
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,619
and so that we can understand

232
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:55,059
that there are times in which God is giving us truth

233
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,619
with regard to something that's happening here on Earth

234
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,059
versus something happening in Heaven.

235
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,379
By the way, there are times in which

236
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,619
the events are taking place simultaneous, all right?

237
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:10,059
Here's the difficulty when you're writing a timeline

238
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,219
of something that's taking place simultaneous

239
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,139
and something's happening in heaven

240
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,779
and something's happening at earth at the same time.

241
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,859
You can't, you have to separate them

242
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:23,039
from a page to another page,

243
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,659
but it doesn't mean that they're happening

244
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,879
in chronological different order.

245
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,979
Does that make sense?

246
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:32,079
And so it's a matter of understanding that truth.

247
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
Let me say this, the Book of Revelation was recorded,

248
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,879
it was written down according to what we can understand

249
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,039
historically in the AD 90s.

250
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,319
It was, the best estimate that we have is AD 96,

251
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,799
Domitian was the evil Roman emperor

252
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,959
and God's people were facing continued persecution.

253
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,439
So often we've referenced Nero

254
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,479
as being a wicked Roman emperor, and he was,

255
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,899
and he's rightly due that term

256
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,899
of being a wicked Roman emperor,

257
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,579
and he did much harm and brought much persecution

258
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,819
to the people of God,

259
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,739
but Domitian was an evil Roman emperor as well,

260
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:10,860
and we find that he was described this way

261
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,860
as being a ruthless but efficient autocrat.

262
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,099
Okay, here's what he did.

263
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:24,099
He demanded to be worshiped as Lord and God.

264
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,959
That's what he demanded.

265
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,919
And when God's people refused to worship him, praise God,

266
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,239
the persecution intensified greatly.

267
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,720
And when that persecution intensified,

268
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,939
and we find that those who refused to worship him

269
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,919
as he demanded to be so,

270
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,159
that they were subject to this severe persecution.

271
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,119
John is therefore, as we read

272
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,759
and we understand the historical aspects,

273
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,579
in fact, in verse number nine, we read this truth,

274
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,479
that John is therefore exiled to the island Patmos.

275
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:02,220
That island is a small island in the Aegean Sea,

276
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,540
which is in the southwest,

277
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,699
it's located southwest of Ephesus,

278
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,139
and we find that it is with this backdrop

279
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,419
that God gives this book of Revelation.

280
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:17,619
Now, I hope, and just, it's a simple thing,

281
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:19,220
but it's an important thing.

282
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,319
Sometimes in the top of the Bible that you might have,

283
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,020
it might say the Revelation of John the Apostle.

284
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,039
This is not the Revelation of John,

285
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,880
it is the Revelation of Jesus Christ.

286
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,839
Okay, so if your Bible says that in the top,

287
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,440
sometimes it will say the book name or whatever,

288
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
so mine says the Revelation to John.

289
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
And I'm okay with that, because it's the Revelation to John.

290
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,599
It is not the Revelation of John,

291
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,759
it is the Revelation of Jesus Christ.

292
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,139
We see that in verse number one.

293
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,860
Notice with me this evening,

294
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,259
as we look at these just first three verses,

295
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,739
introductory into the book of Revelation.

296
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,500
The Bible says this in Revelation 1.1.

297
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,959
The revelation of Jesus Christ,

298
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,099
which God gave unto him to show unto his servants

299
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:09,459
things which must shortly come to pass.

300
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,179
And he sent and signified it by his angel

301
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,300
unto his servant John,

302
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,059
who bear record of the word of God

303
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,959
and of the testimony of Jesus Christ

304
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,199
and of all things that he saw.

305
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,239
Blessed is he that readeth,

306
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,720
and they that hear the words of this prophecy

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,279
and keep those things which are written therein

308
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,959
for the time is at hand.

309
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,839
If you're taking notes,

310
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,880
I've titled the message very simply this evening,

311
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
the Revelation of Jesus Christ.

312
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,839
Number one, as we look at verse number one,

313
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,819
we see the purpose of the book.

314
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,639
God reveals to us in this singular verse of Scripture

315
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,179
the purpose of this book.

316
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,300
And we find first and foremost,

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,339
it is the revelation of Jesus Christ.

318
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,660
The word revelation literally means an unveiling,

319
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,179
to lift the veil, to reveal something.

320
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,559
And we find that first and foremost,

321
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,580
this book, the book of Revelation,

322
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,440
is the unveiling of Jesus Christ.

323
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,899
We find that throughout the book of Revelation,

324
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,940
we see the glory of Jesus Christ.

325
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,220
And what a joy.

326
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,779
We understand that as we read

327
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,020
through the book of Revelation,

328
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,079
this is the book that reveals to us

329
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,480
how Jesus is going to come back to this earth.

330
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
We read that this is the book that reveals to us

331
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,359
that he is the Lion of the tribe of Judah,

332
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,839
that he is a conquering king.

333
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,320
I'm thankful that on his first visit to earth,

334
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,040
that he came in that human form,

335
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,679
and we're soon approaching to the Christmas season,

336
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,519
and we read and understand about the incarnation

337
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,779
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

338
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,880
when God took upon himself the form of a man.

339
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,760
God robed in flesh.

340
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,179
What an amazing truth of God's word.

341
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,919
But we understand that Jesus Christ came that first time,

342
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,119
not as a conquering king, but as a sacrificial lamb.

343
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:04,040
He came to give his life a ransom for all.

344
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,559
He came to go to a cruel cross,

345
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,940
so that we, as his creation, that we could be redeemed,

346
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,679
because sin had to be paid for.

347
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,899
But we find, as we read the book of Revelation,

348
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,220
that here, we find that God is revealing to us

349
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,279
that unveiling of the Lord Jesus Christ,

350
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,299
and I would submit to you this evening,

351
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,500
that as we approach the book of Revelation,

352
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
as we study through the book of Revelation,

353
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
if you're just going to read the book of Revelation,

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,660
if you're just gonna come to hear the preaching

355
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,739
from the book of Revelation,

356
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:37,619
so that you can satisfy your mind

357
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,299
with regard to end times prophecies,

358
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:43,260
and the timing of this, and the timing of that,

359
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,799
can I tell you that we miss the point?

360
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,320
Because the point is the revelation of Jesus Christ.

361
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,419
I'll say a little more of that in just a moment,

362
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:57,220
but understand with me that the Bible also tells us

363
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,619
here in this verse of Scripture,

364
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,100
that his purpose is not only to reveal Jesus Christ,

365
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,419
but to show unto his servants things

366
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,980
which must shortly come to pass.

367
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,339
Notice there again in verse number one,

368
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,179
it says the revelation of Jesus Christ,

369
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,619
which God gave unto him,

370
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:20,419
notice this, to show unto his servants.

371
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,899
That word is plural.

372
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,899
It's interesting because at the end of the verse,

373
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,200
it says that he sent and signified it by his angel

374
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,160
unto his servant, singular, John.

375
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,899
The book of Revelation was not given specifically to John

376
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,940
for himself, it's to reveal Jesus Christ,

377
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,139
and these things which must shortly come to pass

378
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,739
to his servants, plural.

379
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,779
By the way, I'm thankful to be a servant

380
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,540
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

381
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm thankful that we, as the saved people of God,

382
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,299
that we are his servants,

383
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,839
and that he has preserved this book for us.

384
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,779
We find that we can, as we look at this book,

385
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,859
and we find that many of the events

386
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,619
that we will study through in weeks and months to come,

387
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,260
many of the events of this book will take place

388
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,359
after the church is raptured.

389
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,220
We find that as we begin reading in the first three chapters

390
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,859
of the book of Revelation, that you begin to read again

391
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,799
those scenes, if you will, on Earth,

392
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,660
where God is referencing and sending these messages

393
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,700
to these churches, and we read of the seven churches

394
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,299
in Asia, then you find that the church

395
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,980
is no longer visible on Earth

396
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,899
after the start of chapter number four,

397
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,880
all the way until chapter 19.

398
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,480
You find that there's many things that take place,

399
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,500
the tribulation, so on and so forth,

400
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,579
and we will study through and we'll deal with those things,

401
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,139
but it's interesting that many of the events in this book,

402
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,279
the book of Revelation, they're going to take place

403
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,119
after the church is raptured.

404
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,660
But I would say this, that the truth that is given to us

405
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,380
in the book of Revelation should cause us to do two things.

406
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Number one, it should cause us to adore our Savior.

407
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,179
The Bible says that we're to stand in awe of God,

408
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,700
to stand in awe of God.

409
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:18,139
Truly, this evening, our God is an awesome God.

410
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:22,419
Truly, this evening, our God is worthy of our adoration.

411
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,059
We seek every service, we seek in our lives daily

412
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,940
that God would be exalted, that the Lord Jesus Christ

413
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,619
would be magnified in our lives,

414
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,460
that we would say, as John said, John the Baptist said,

415
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,979
he must increase and I must decrease.

416
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,940
And the reality is that when we study

417
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,159
through the book of Revelation,

418
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,460
though many of the events will take place

419
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,419
after the church is raptured,

420
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,059
that the content of the book still causes us

421
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,080
to adore our Savior.

422
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,919
Why?

423
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,640
Because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ.

424
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,700
Not only does it cause us to adore our Savior,

425
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,500
but I would say this, it causes us,

426
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,340
it should cause us anyway, to accept his plan.

427
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,859
By the way, aren't you thankful that God has a plan?

428
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,099
Aren't you thankful that God's plan

429
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,979
is better than your plan?

430
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,020
Amen.

431
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Sometimes we look around and we see all these things

432
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,820
that are going on, and I'm about,

433
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,799
I'm just being straight, honest with you,

434
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,219
I'm about sick and tired of election cycles in our nation.

435
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,979
It'd drive me up a wall.

436
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,820
Everywhere you turn, there's something going on.

437
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,580
Listen, I'm thankful that our God sits on this throne

438
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,380
and I'm thankful that he has a plan,

439
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,340
and when everything seems to be going absolutely insane,

440
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,619
we can rejoice in knowing that God has a plan.

441
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,739
God has a plan.

442
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:41,340
None of this stuff surprises him.

443
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,140
You say, did you see this alert?

444
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,580
Did you see what was going on over here?

445
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Did you see this?

446
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,840
God knew all about it.

447
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,080
God knew all about it, and that caused us to rejoice.

448
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,739
By the way, it caused us to have peace,

449
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:55,580
and to have joy.

450
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,320
Somebody shared this with me on Friday.

451
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,880
I don't know, I don't live there,

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,919
and I'm just telling you what I was told.

453
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,839
that in the state of Washington, of course you already know some things

454
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,039
about the state of Washington, not talking about Washington DC, in the state

455
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,639
West Coast, state of Washington, you do not vote in person. Everything is an

456
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:22,159
absentee ballot type of vote and that's how it works. And when you submit your

457
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,079
vote you have to write on the outside of the envelope whether you are voting

458
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:33,239
Republican or Democrat. Okay, that's what I was told by a resident of Washington

459
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:39,479
on Friday morning and here's what I said to him. If I didn't know God and if I

460
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:44,319
didn't know what he has given to me in his Word, I'd go absolutely insane with

461
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,759
that kind of stuff. But you know what I can rest in? My God's in control. My God

462
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,679
reigns. My God has a plan and when I understand that I don't have to get so

463
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,599
fixated and so consumed with all the things that are happening around me on

464
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,199
this earth. No, I can go to the Bible and I can adore my Savior and I can accept

465
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,319
his plan and I can have joy and I can have peace because I'm telling you if we

466
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,679
had to live in this world without the truth of this book we'd go absolutely

467
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,239
insane. But I'm so thankful that we serve a God who has a plan. His plan is

468
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:28,959
perfect. Notice with me in verse number one the Bible says the revelation of

469
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:34,159
Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants, then notice this,

470
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,759
things. So he's going to show, he doesn't listen, he wants us to know. You know

471
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,279
there's a difference between showing something and hiding something. Do you

472
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,559
know that Daniel was told to hide it, to keep? No, we find in the book of

473
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:56,639
Revelation that God is saying from the onset to show, to make known. God wants us

474
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:01,159
to know these things unto his servants, notice these things, which must shortly

475
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,559
come to pass. I'm gonna tell you that in verse number one that phrase must

476
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,039
shortly come to pass has caused people throughout the centuries to really mess

477
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,239
up their interpretation of the book of Revelation because in there, listen, do

478
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,679
you know that what's short to you and what's short to me is not what's short

479
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,519
to God? Do you understand that God is outside of time? Do you understand this

480
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,599
evening that God's timetable is not your timetable or my timetable? By the way, let

481
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,639
me say this, when we talk about time, do you know this evening that many of us

482
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,439
here tonight, we could understand when we start talking in measurements of time

483
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:42,199
of months and even years. We can understand that. We've lived for years, we

484
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:46,039
could talk to somebody about, well in four years I'm planning to do, and we got

485
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,399
an idea, but you know some of the little kids in here, you tell them that

486
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,279
something's gonna happen in four years and they're like five years old and

487
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,159
they're like, it's their whole lifetime. It's just like us talking about a

488
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:05,319
million years. It's hard for us to comprehend that, but God is outside of

489
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,119
time and so some have taken this which must shortly come to pass and they've

490
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,079
taken and they've actually, there's some that would have the position that

491
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,579
everything in the book of Revelation has already happened, it's already taken

492
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:20,079
place. Well I'm gonna tell you what, it's a preterist position is the

493
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:31,339
terminology that's used and let me tell you this, this ain't heaven. Let me say

494
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:36,419
that again, this ain't heaven. You say that's not good English, it ain't. This

495
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,899
is not heaven, amen? Listen, when I read the book of Revelation and I read

496
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:44,579
everything that takes place in the book of Revelation, if you come away from that

497
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,499
and say all of that's been fulfilled, then where's the a thousand-year reign

498
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:54,859
of Christ on earth and where's the eternity? Because if all of that took

499
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,579
place in the first century, which is what a preterist position would be, that it

500
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:04,459
happened during that first, second century of human, of our time, then

501
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:12,419
a thousand years passed there, you're at 1200, 1400, we're at 2024! This is not

502
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:17,579
heaven. There's a problem with that interpretation and so we must understand

503
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,219
what does it mean when God says that these things must shortly come to pass.

504
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:26,459
Understand with me, there's a difference between something being imminent and

505
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:33,659
something being immediate. There's a difference between something being

506
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,339
imminent and something being immediate. Not only that, but the idea of this word

507
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:44,859
shortly, it's not so much dealing with when, but how. In other words, these events

508
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,099
that are given to us, these things that God is going to show us in the book of

509
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:55,099
Revelation, once they start happening, it's swift. It's very quick, the way that

510
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:59,179
it works. Listen, when you start reading about the sealed judgments, I mean, one

511
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,099
gets done and there's another one coming. The vials, the trumpets, I mean, it's just

512
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:10,259
quick, right? And so we begin to see this truth and so do not allow yourselves to

513
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:16,859
get confused or to inappropriately interpret the truth of this book by this

514
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:20,339
thought that they must come shortly or shortly come to pass.

515
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,259
Understand with me that the Bible tells us in Psalm 90, take a moment and turn

516
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:29,019
there if you will, Psalm 90, it's important for us to understand these

517
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:34,059
truths. In Psalm 90, that's a psalm of Moses, and we find that in this psalm,

518
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:39,379
many times we talk about the truth of, Lord, teach us to number our days, three

519
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:46,379
score and ten, if by, you know, the truth with regard to having four score, if by

520
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:51,659
reason of strength they be four score years. But understand that prior to God

521
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:58,299
working in this truth given to us about 70 or 80 years with regard to

522
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,659
Moses, notice in verse number four of the text, the Bible says for a thousand

523
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:14,179
years. How long is a thousand years? That's a long time. To us. To us. For a

524
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:21,419
thousand years in thy sight. Now, who's thy? That's God. In thy sight are but as

525
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:27,099
yesterday when it is passed. Now, I know sometimes we think about yesterday like,

526
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,939
man, what happened yesterday? It seems like it was so long ago. But yesterday

527
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:38,219
really wasn't that long ago. For us. And as a watch in the night, verse 5, there

528
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:42,699
thou carryest them away as with a flood, there as they sleep in the morning, they

529
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:46,579
are like grass which groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up, in

530
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:50,379
the evening it is cut down and withereth. But we find that truth in verse number

531
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:54,539
four that God says that, listen, for a thousand years in thy sight are but as

532
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,139
yesterday when it is passed. Notice this truth coupled with what we find in

533
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:04,659
2nd Peter chapter 3. And so often we talk about 2nd Peter chapter 3 in

534
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:09,579
verse number 9, which is a precious truth of God's Word with regard to the long

535
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:13,059
suffering of God. And he's not willing that any should perish, but that all

536
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:16,939
should come to repentance. But in 2nd Peter 3 and verse number 8, the Bible

537
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:22,799
says this, but beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing. So what's he saying? He

538
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,359
wants us to be aware of it, he wants us to be informed of it, he wants us to know

539
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:33,599
it, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as

540
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,839
one day. So when God says something is going to come to pass shortly, his

541
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,359
shortly is different than your shortly and then my shortly. I've said this at

542
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,639
the end of 2nd Peter, it talks about that if we suffer for a season. I don't know how

543
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:55,279
long a season is. God knows how long a season is. And here we find that he's

544
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,959
given to us the purpose of this book, that it's the revelation of Jesus

545
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:04,559
Christ that is to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass.

546
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,359
Notice at the end of the verse it says, and he sent and signified it by his

547
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:16,079
angel unto his servant John. We find again, as I mentioned by way of

548
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,919
introduction, that word signified the use of symbolism. I think it's quite

549
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,719
interesting that as you study through the book of Revelation and you see the

550
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,919
symbolic, the symbols that are used and the symbolism that you find throughout,

551
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,760
that there's something about symbols that are not weakened by time like

552
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:43,679
language can be. Language can be weakened by time. Why? Because language kind of

553
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,719
evolves. Let me give you an example. The word conversation is used in our Bibles

554
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:56,119
in 1st Peter, that we're to walk in humility, excuse me, in holiness in all

555
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:04,079
manner of conversation. What that word means is behavior, our lifestyle. But you

556
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,959
know that's normally not how we use the word conversation today. We use the word

557
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,119
conversation that, hey, before service Armando and I had a conversation. That's

558
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:19,839
how we use the word. So the word, because language kind of evolves, in fact if you

559
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,440
get a dictionary today and you start looking up words, what usage or what

560
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,599
definition is provided first in a dictionary is the one that's most

561
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,559
commonly used at the time of the writing of the dictionary. So in other words, when

562
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,320
you're looking up words in the Bible, it's better to get an older dictionary

563
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,799
than a newer dictionary. That's why I recommend the 1828 Noah Webster's

564
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,880
Dictionary. Why? Because almost always the first definition given for a word in

565
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,880
that dictionary is the definition that we're to go by here in God's Word.

566
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,959
And so symbolism is outside of that aspect.

567
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:06,079
of language being weakened over time,

568
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,259
and I think, listen, it's the wisdom of God

569
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,159
to use these symbols.

570
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,859
By the way, the Bible talks about,

571
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,579
I believe it's in Revelation 17 here,

572
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,819
I didn't jot it down, where it talks about

573
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:21,419
the woman that was drunk with the blood of the martyrs.

574
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,479
That's a little bit different

575
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:27,039
than just saying somebody's evil, or they're wicked.

576
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,859
It gives to us a depth, and we see how God uses

577
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:34,859
the symbolism throughout the book of Revelation.

578
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,019
So we see the purpose, number two, if you're taking notes.

579
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,659
Notice with me in verse number two,

580
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,579
the precise record of the book.

581
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,779
We see the purpose of the book,

582
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,379
but I want you to notice the precise record.

583
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,699
We find that in verse number two,

584
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:52,099
it's very interesting to me how God uses

585
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,299
and records this for us to help us as the readers,

586
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:57,699
and those that are studying it.

587
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,899
It says, speaking about the fact that the angel

588
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,619
signified unto his servant John,

589
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:06,579
notice in verse two, who bear record of the word of God,

590
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:09,739
and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,

591
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:12,759
and of all things that he saw.

592
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,939
We find that, of course, I mentioned already

593
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,219
in verse number one, that the truth of inspiration

594
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:20,219
is clearly seen, that all scripture

595
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:22,299
is given by inspiration of God,

596
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,539
but we find that as we come to verse number two,

597
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,759
and we think about the precise record,

598
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,659
you think about precision, and you think about

599
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:29,899
somebody being precise.

600
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,819
Listen, John was not just being haphazardly

601
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:36,419
just jotting down, just kind of let his mind wander,

602
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,099
oh yeah, I missed something, no, no, it's precise.

603
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,259
I don't know if you ever spent time in maybe college,

604
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,059
and you had a class, and you missed a class,

605
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,819
and you needed to get notes from a fellow student.

606
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,839
There's certain people that you wanted to get notes from,

607
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,019
and then there's other people that you said,

608
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,219
you know what, I don't know if I want their notes, why?

609
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:56,579
I wanna go to somebody that takes good notes.

610
00:31:57,739 --> 00:31:59,399
Why, because I wanna be able to get

611
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,039
whatever was given in that class.

612
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,139
You know, not everybody takes good notes.

613
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,279
Am I not right?

614
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,939
Not everyone takes good notes.

615
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:14,639
And so we find here that the faithfulness of John

616
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:16,959
is given to us in verse number two,

617
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,759
where it says, who bear record.

618
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,079
I think about even that terminology of someone

619
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,399
that is diligent, and faithful, and studious,

620
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,759
to make sure they're bearing record,

621
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,559
they're writing it down, they don't wanna miss a thing.

622
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,839
He understood that it was from God.

623
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,759
He understood that it was given to him,

624
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,239
but it was for the servants, according to verse number one.

625
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,619
And so he's bearing record.

626
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:46,279
Now we understand that God is the one

627
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,439
that promised to preserve,

628
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:53,199
but I'm thankful for a faithful record taker, keeper.

629
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,359
He was faithful.

630
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,759
Notice it tells us that it tells us there at the verse

631
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,919
that the record of the word of God,

632
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,039
so he knew that it was the word of God.

633
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,759
He knew the authority of what it was.

634
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:07,559
By the way, that will cause you to keep better records,

635
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,979
by the way, when you know that it's from God.

636
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:12,039
It says, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,

637
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,719
and then notice this phrase, and of all things that he saw.

638
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:19,719
Of all things that he saw.

639
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,199
So what does that help me to understand?

640
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,939
Well, going back to some of those principles

641
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:26,539
that I mentioned by way of introduction this evening,

642
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:30,199
he gave us a record, a complete record.

643
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:33,859
If there's a place where there's a silent area,

644
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,399
I don't need to try to put my opinion in there.

645
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,499
I don't need to try to add things in there.

646
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,379
He gave a good record.

647
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:44,019
He put down what God gave him,

648
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:47,859
and he put down accurately, and with precision,

649
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,419
he gave us this record, and of course, God has preserved it,

650
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,099
and it says, and of all things that he saw.

651
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:56,739
Notice with me, look over at verse 19 here in Revelation 1.

652
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:58,579
The Bible says this.

653
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,499
Write the things which thou hast seen,

654
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,179
and the things which are,

655
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,539
and the things which shall be hereafter.

656
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:08,899
It's an interesting verse of scripture

657
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:11,279
because it deals with really all the aspects

658
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:14,219
of past, present, and future.

659
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,099
He says, write down the things which thou hast seen, past,

660
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,779
and the things which are, present,

661
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,439
and the things which shall be, future, hereafter.

662
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:29,579
And John was faithful to bear record

663
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,979
of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,

664
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:36,299
and of all things that he saw.

665
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:39,219
That should cause us to rejoice this evening.

666
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,879
Should cause us to have a measure of confidence this evening.

667
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,579
We find the purpose, we find the precise record.

668
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,659
I want you to notice number three.

669
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,379
There's a promise of blessing.

670
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,639
A promise of blessing.

671
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,819
Verse three is a great verse of scripture

672
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,639
that I would submit to you is a verse

673
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,639
that is obviously applicable to this book of Revelation,

674
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,419
but it's also applicable to the whole of scripture.

675
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:10,459
To all 66 books, this promise that is mentioned

676
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:13,059
in verse number three, it's a promise that we see

677
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:15,179
throughout the pages of scripture.

678
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,739
It's something that we see interwoven

679
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,579
through the pages of scripture

680
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,819
that we're to hear and to do the things

681
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:25,299
that God has given to us in his word.

682
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:28,219
That we are to, God didn't just give it to us

683
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,059
so that we keep it on a bookshelf somewhere.

684
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:31,939
God didn't give it to us so that we could

685
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:35,839
answer some questions of some Bible game,

686
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,679
or whatever it might be.

687
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:39,339
No, God gave it to us because he wants us

688
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,859
to know something, he wants us to apply something,

689
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:44,099
he wants us to do something.

690
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,819
It's interesting, however, that though the truth

691
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:49,859
of verse number three is a truth that is applicable

692
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:53,339
to all of scripture, it's only found in the way

693
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,419
that it's given to us here in the book of Revelation.

694
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:59,459
In other words, in this concise statement.

695
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,099
Notice what the Bible says in verse number three.

696
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,719
Blessed is he that readeth.

697
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:08,859
Blessed is he that readeth.

698
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:11,219
Now let me ask you, is that singular or plural?

699
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,219
It's singular.

700
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:16,859
Blessed is he that readeth.

701
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,059
So in other words, when I come to verse number three,

702
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:21,219
here's what I'm understanding that God is seeking

703
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:23,159
to communicate to us as his people,

704
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,319
that as individual believers,

705
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:27,379
I ought to read the book of Revelation.

706
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,539
Not only the book of Revelation,

707
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,099
but the whole of scripture,

708
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,099
because there's a blessing in reading the word of God.

709
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:43,099
And so we find that he says, blessed is he that readeth.

710
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:46,599
You know, there are some denominations

711
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,899
that absolutely flat out ignore

712
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,499
the entire book of Revelation.

713
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,019
It's as if it's not even part of the Bible.

714
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,579
But it's in this book in the opening statements

715
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,119
that say, blessed is he that readeth.

716
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,699
And so there's an expectation that God communicates to me,

717
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,179
and I hope to you this evening,

718
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,599
that God expects his people to read his word.

719
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,619
Yes, the book of Revelation,

720
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,699
as it's contained here in verse number three,

721
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,779
but I believe that it's applicable to Genesis 1-1

722
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,779
through Revelation 22-21,

723
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:22,619
that there is a blessing in reading God's word.

724
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:26,139
What a joy.

725
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,259
But does it stop there?

726
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:32,259
Notice, and they, now that's plural,

727
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:37,859
that hear the words of this prophecy.

728
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:41,299
Now, that's kind of interesting,

729
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:43,779
because it's the blessed is he that readeth,

730
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,059
so that's an individual reading,

731
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,979
but then it says, and they, plural,

732
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,619
that hear the words of this prophecy.

733
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,479
Now, how do you hear the words of the prophecy?

734
00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:01,479
Somebody else publicly reading it or preaching it, right?

735
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,739
That's how, you're hearing it tonight,

736
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,539
because I'm reading it, so you're hearing it.

737
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:09,219
Now, you're following along in your Bible,

738
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,759
so you're getting a double blessing, amen?

739
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:14,719
You're reading it and you're hearing it, praise the Lord.

740
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,259
And it says, so again, if the expectation

741
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,659
in verse number three in the beginning part of the verse

742
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,859
is that God's people would read it,

743
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,919
the expectation also is that the people of God

744
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:31,399
would gather together and hear the word of God.

745
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:34,219
You ever read the book of Ezra?

746
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,939
Man, they gathered together for a big part of the day.

747
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:40,779
Why?

748
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,979
To hear the word of the Lord.

749
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:48,299
He stood up on a pulpit of wood, amen?

750
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:49,839
And he just read.

751
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,839
Now, they confessed, but they read publicly.

752
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,499
The reading of God's word is so important.

753
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:00,499
You know, there's a pastor that I know,

754
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:02,179
I actually went to have the opportunity,

755
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:03,819
when we went to Israel a couple of years ago,

756
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,139
he and his wife were on the trip with us,

757
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:06,619
got to know him a little better,

758
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,239
but I've known him kind of from a distance

759
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,059
for a number of years and then got to know him better

760
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,379
as we're on that trip together.

761
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:15,679
And he pastors a church in the inner, inner, inner parts

762
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,619
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kensington.

763
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:21,179
And man, it's a bad place.

764
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,939
And they had all kinds of things going on in Kensington.

765
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:27,199
They were just drugs people, I mean, all kinds of craziness.

766
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,859
They go out into the church yard and it's all fenced in,

767
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,779
but man, they'd find needles in the church yard

768
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,779
all the time from drug users and this, that,

769
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:34,619
and the other thing.

770
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,119
And it was just a real problem.

771
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,099
They try to have kids, the church is growing,

772
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,959
kids trying to go out and play after church

773
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:42,619
and there's drug stuff all over, it's a mess.

774
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:44,079
So you know what he did?

775
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,939
How many of you heard of Alexander Scorby?

776
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:49,379
All right, he's the guy that read the Bible on cassette.

777
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:52,059
That's the first time I ever heard Alexander Scorby.

778
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,859
Back when they had cassettes, little kids,

779
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,699
you have no idea what cassettes are.

780
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:59,019
But back in the day before everything that you know

781
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,659
about hearing something audibly, they had cassettes.

782
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:03,059
And Alexander Scorby read.

783
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,979
the Bible on cassette. Now if you have an app today, maybe your app, your Bible app,

784
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:13,939
you can have it read to you. Here's what the pastor did. He got some some sound

785
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:18,259
equipment, he put it out in the play in the in the parts of the church outside,

786
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:24,699
and he put it on continuous play of the Bible being read. You know what he

787
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:33,099
noticed? Drugs were gone. People weren't coming around. You know why? It brought

788
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:40,099
conviction. They didn't want to hear God's Word being read. I thought that's

789
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:53,099
genius. There's a blessing in hearing God's Word. Notice verse number three, it

790
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,819
says this, blessed be he that readeth and they that hear the words of this

791
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:05,459
prophecy and keep those things which are written therein. The key that we find

792
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:13,819
here in verse number three, it's good to read, it's good to hear, but if we don't

793
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:21,019
keep, if we don't do, if we don't apply, we've missed the whole point. There's a

794
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:25,819
blessing in reading, there's a blessing in hearing, and there's a blessing in

795
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:32,219
keeping. Can I tell you this evening that God gave us the book of Revelation, He

796
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:36,899
gave us the whole canon of Scripture so that we could read it, we could hear it,

797
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:42,779
and we would keep it, that we would obey it, that we'd apply it. I often encourage

798
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:50,619
people, I do this in my own life, what has God given me this passage for? Why has

799
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:55,019
God recorded this book, these chapters that I read? When I read the Bible this

800
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,019
morning, what does God have for me? Is there something from this portion of

801
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:04,699
Scripture that should cause me to change my behavior in some manner? Let me tell

802
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:11,139
you, the answer is yes, and we're to comply with, we're to apply the truth of

803
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:15,659
our of our Bibles in our lives, and we're to to be doers of the Word and not

804
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,459
hearers only. We find that there are times in which we read the Scriptures

805
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:24,219
and say, what has God given this to me for? He's given to us truth about Himself

806
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:28,659
that should cause me to praise Him more, that should cause me to exalt Him and to

807
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:35,619
stand in awe of who He is, and we find that there's a promise of blessing. Now

808
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:42,459
if you read verse number three and then you decide, you get that far and say, yeah

809
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:47,359
I think I'm gonna put this aside, I'm not gonna read it, you're crazy because it

810
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,519
says there's a blessing. There's a blessing. We notice that the verse ends

811
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,679
again with this thought as it was in verse number one, these things which

812
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,799
must shortly come to pass, it says at the end of verse number one, for the time is

813
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:12,959
at hand. Can I tell you this evening that if the time was at hand in AD 96, the

814
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:21,999
time is at hand in 2024. And we find that as we study this book of Revelation, I

815
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,479
mentioned this in the beginning with those principles, the book of Revelation

816
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:33,039
is not simply given to us so that we can understand a timeline or so that we can

817
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,759
satisfy our curiosity about the future. A lot of people that are curious about

818
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:41,959
the future, what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen? What's gonna happen? People

819
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:47,999
have that curiosity. The book of Revelation is not simply given so that

820
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:52,959
we can have a timeline or so that we can satisfy our curiosity. I believe that the

821
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,839
book of Revelation is given and yes, many things are revealed to us about those

822
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,999
things, but if we only get those things and don't see our Savior, we've missed

823
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:11,159
the point. Because it should encourage every believer as we read through this

824
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,159
book of Revelation to be mindful of the fact that it's the revelation of Jesus

825
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:22,279
Christ. I believe that we can certainly develop a timeline based on the

826
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:25,399
events that are given to us in the book of Revelation, that we can have an

827
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:30,239
understanding of what's going to happen, and we can have that. But listen,

828
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,519
understand that the purpose is that we'd see our Savior in his rightful place.

829
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:43,079
I want you to think about this for a moment as we close. As Domitian is ruling as an

830
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,159
evil Roman Emperor and bringing great persecution against the believers

831
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:55,719
because of their refusal to bow and worship him as Lord and God. And it's at

832
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:02,279
that time that God gives this revelation of Jesus Christ, the book that we'll be

833
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:08,679
studying. You understand that those people were suffering greatly, and it was

834
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:16,119
not given to them simply for them to understand a sequence of events, but for

835
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:23,719
them to see that their God is in control, and that their God is on the throne, and

836
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:31,159
that their God has a plan. Because it was not just that during that terrible

837
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,479
persecution and all that they're faced with that they sit down say, well I know

838
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:42,239
that this is going to happen, and then this is going to happen. No, no, they're seeing God. And yes, God reveals those

839
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:48,439
things to us, and I'm thankful for that. But if all we do is approach the book of

840
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:55,999
Revelation for a timeline to satisfy our curiosity, we're going to miss the

841
00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:03,599
biggest point of the book of Revelation. And I hope, it's my desire, that as we

842
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,719
study through the book of Revelation, that we will see God as Isaiah did in

843
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:13,799
chapter 6 of the book of Isaiah, high holy and lifted up. That we'll see him in

844
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:19,119
his rightful place, that we will worship and adore him, that we will accept and

845
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,719
rejoice in the fact that he has a plan, that we will be motivated to tell others

846
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,399
about our wonderful Savior. And yes, we'll be able to understand things about

847
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:32,999
the sequence of events, and we'll be able to understand and answer things with

848
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:37,839
regard to what's going to happen, because God's revealed it to us. But we must

849
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,319
remember that it's God who has revealed it to us, and ultimately it is the

850
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,519
revelation of Jesus Christ and of his plan. Let's pray together. Father, we love

851
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,359
you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your word. Thank you for this

852
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:58,519
book of Revelation. We thank you for the entirety of Scripture. How thankful we

853
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:07,079
are to have a Bible tonight. Lord, so many around the globe don't have a Bible. We

854
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:15,079
have one. In fact, many of us, probably most of us, have more than one. We can

855
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:21,919
read it anytime we want. We can gather here at least four times a week and hear

856
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:31,039
the word of God taught and preached. Lord, we are a blessed people, because you've

857
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,119
given to us your word, and you have revealed yourself to us. I pray that you'd

858
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:43,039
help us, Lord, to be doers of the word. I pray that as we even begin tonight this

859
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,239
study into the book of Revelation, that you'd help each of us to determine even

860
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:57,519
at this moment in this message that our purpose and our desire would be to see you in your

861
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:06,439
rightful place. That we'd accept that you have a plan and a purpose. That we'd seek

862
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:12,039
to live for you and to serve you faithfully. I pray that in these moments of invitation

863
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:16,479
that you'd move and work as only you can. I pray, God, that you'd be glorified in

864
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:22,159
and through our lives. I pray that every decision would be made in such a way that

865
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,359
you'd be glorified. For it's in Christ's name we pray. We just end with...
