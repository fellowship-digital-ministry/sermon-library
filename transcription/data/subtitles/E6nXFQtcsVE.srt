1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,239
at verses 7 through 11 of this passage of Scripture and dealt with my fellow

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:11,439
workers. And we talked about the recognition of those fellow workers.

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,719
Paul references them, he talks about them. We spoke about not only the recognition

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,840
but then the role. What was the responsibility? What was it that these

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,959
fellow workers were doing? And then we spoke of the reward for the fellow

6
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:30,959
workers. And what a blessing to know that our God has given us, not only it's

7
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:35,639
through His grace and His Spirit that we serve Him, but then He's given us the

8
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:41,080
truth that He will reward us for our faithful service. And what a blessing to

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,000
understand that truth. This morning we're gonna look at verses 12 and 13 and we're

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
gonna look specifically at Epaphras. Notice in verse 12 the Bible says,

11
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,000
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always laboring

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,200
fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,120
will of God. For I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,839
that are in Laodicea and them in Heropolis. As we look at these verses of

15
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:15,239
Scripture, we're reminded that we first meet Epaphras or learn of Epaphras in

16
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,199
the first chapter of the book of Colossians. We understand also that he's

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:24,160
mentioned in the book of Philemon and these are the three references of this

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,839
particular character that we find throughout the Word of God. Once in

19
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,839
Colossians 1, here in Colossians 4, and then briefly mentioned in the book of

20
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:36,559
Philemon. You may remember that it was through Epaphras that the Apostle Paul

21
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:41,720
learned about these group of believers or this group of believers in Colossae.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,959
Remember in the first chapter that Paul, we mentioned this as we began studying

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,120
the book of Colossians, that Paul did not personally know the believers in

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,760
Colossae. Paul was not on a missionary journey and went to the city of Colossae

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,559
and planted a church. It didn't work that way. Now we understand with some of the

26
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,559
books that we read and some of the churches, you think about the church in

27
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,839
Ephesus, you think about the church in Philippi, these are places where Paul

28
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:16,000
went specifically on missionary journeys and knew the people personally that he's

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,880
writing to. We can think about the churches in the region of Galatias. The

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,720
book of Galatians is written to those churches in those four cities and during

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,479
the first missionary journey, the Apostle Paul visited those particular

32
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,720
locations and souls were saved and churches were established and what a joy.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,240
But here in the book of Colossians, we understand that Paul never was in the

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,479
city of Colossae. He heard about these believers, this group, this church in

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:49,639
Colossae through Epaphras. We're not sure, it's not a hundred percent clear

36
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,520
whether Epaphras simply visited the Apostle Paul while he was in Roman

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,199
prison or if Epaphras was imprisoned as well. But we understand that this book of

38
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,360
Colossians is one of those books that we refer to as being a prison epistle and

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,679
the Apostle Paul is in prison writing to this church and he mentions in the first

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,759
chapter how that from the first day that he heard about their faith that he was

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,440
rejoicing with them and he was praying for them and he gives them distinctly in

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,279
the first chapter how he was praying for them and his desire for them and all of

43
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:33,039
those things that he knew about this body of believers including the conflict

44
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,320
that they were dealing with because of the entry of false teachers was a result

45
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,919
of the ministry of Epaphras bringing that word to the Apostle Paul. I believe

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,160
that as we look at these two verses of Scripture here in the fourth chapter as

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,639
we near the end of our study of the book of Colossians we would find that from

48
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,199
these two verses of Scripture it seems quite evident that Paul spent some time

49
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,720
with Epaphras and I believe that as we look at these verses of Scripture that

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,479
we are given insight to the character of this man. We find that it was that it

51
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,000
seems as we look at these verses of Scripture that Epaphras was a genuine

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,160
sincere follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am sure this morning that

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,200
Epaphras was an encouragement to the Apostle Paul. And you think about the

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,040
ways in which God allows believers brethren to encourage one another and no

55
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,679
doubt that while Paul was imprisoned in Rome because of his faith we find that

56
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:41,920
God allowed for he and Epaphras to cross paths and what an encouragement it must

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,760
have been. As we look at these verses of Scripture it seems as if as I mentioned

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,959
a moment ago that there's some time that they spent one with another for we find

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,559
that some of the statements that are made are not made simply after a brief

60
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:03,399
30-minute kind of interaction. We find that there was definitely some length of

61
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,640
time there and you'll notice in verse number 13 that it says that he speaking

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,519
of Epaphras hath a great zeal for you as you've noticed on the back of the

63
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,920
bulletin this morning on a preacher message that I've simply entitled the

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,359
zeal of Epaphras. The zeal of Epaphras. To have zeal is to have passion. We find

65
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:27,480
that this man was a man of passion. As we begin to look at this man and look at

66
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,320
what Paul says of Epaphras if you're taking notes this morning I want you to

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,640
first note the devotion of Epaphras. Note his devotion. I believe that the

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,559
devotion of Epaphras is revealed to us through the way in which he is described.

69
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:48,040
Notice the Bible tells us that he is one of you. In other words that Epaphras had

70
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,600
been in Colossae. He had ministered there and we find that he is one of you but

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,040
notice this phrase, a servant of Christ. What a great way to be known. In fact

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,559
oftentimes as you read books of the Bible and especially in the New

73
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:08,720
Testament epistles you'll find that the particular human penman of those

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,519
particular books will begin by saying a servant of Jesus Christ. Paul, a servant

75
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,600
of Jesus Christ. James, a servant of Jesus Christ. Peter, a servant. You think about

76
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,480
the title of being a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. We mentioned last week as

77
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,320
we noted some reasons to rejoice and we spoke about being thankful for his

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,079
person that he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and to consider this morning

79
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,160
that we have the ability, the opportunity, the privilege to be his

80
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,200
servant. Wow. Many times the term servant is a term that is used in a negative

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,700
context. It's looked down upon but to consider this morning that we are

82
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,200
servants of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, to consider the privilege that

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,000
is ours to be his servant, it is a great truth of the Word of God and we find

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,040
that the Bible says that he, Epaphras, is a servant of Christ. I find also the

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Bible tells us here in verse number 12 that he's a man of prayer. A man of

86
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,119
prayer. Notice what the Bible says. He says that he saluteth you, he sends his

87
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:31,000
greetings, but notice this phrase, always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,559
The Word of God reveals much to us on the subject of prayer. We find that Jesus

89
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:43,040
often is praying. We find that of all the things that the disciples could have

90
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,959
asked the Lord to teach them, they make this request, Lord, teach us to pray. We

91
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,040
find that the Lord Jesus Christ was a man of prayer. He prayed. He gave us that

92
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,640
example that we should follow his steps. We find that the Word of God contains a

93
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,600
number of promises with regard to prayer. In fact, as you read and study the Word

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,640
of God, you can read and study the prayers of God's people and you can see

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,399
the way in which they pour out their heart to God and the way in which the

96
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:23,119
hand of God is moved through the prayers of his people. God has chosen that

97
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:29,079
prayer is the vehicle by which his hand is moved. Isn't that awesome? And when you

98
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,719
begin to think about the privilege again of prayer, we mentioned about the

99
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,159
privilege of being a servant of Jesus Christ, but you know that it is a unique

100
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,599
privilege that is reserved for the child of God to pray to the God of heaven. What

101
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:50,599
a privilege. That at any time, for any reason, we can go to God in prayer and we

102
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,760
can stay there as long as we want. Aren't you thankful for that? He never says your

103
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:03,119
time is up. He never says, wait, I'm busy. No, no. At any time, at any moment, for any

104
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:09,719
reason, for as long as we want, we can come boldly to the throne of grace. Why?

105
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:14,719
Because he's given us access through his death, burial, and resurrection. We have

106
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:20,159
direct access to the throne room of heaven and we can bring our petitions

107
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,000
before the face of God who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,919
ask or think. He said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show

109
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,159
thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. You read over in the book of

110
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,000
Lamentations and you read how the Bible tells us that Jeremiah cried out to God

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,200
and how God answered. It's a direct just example of the the fulfillment of that

112
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:55,239
promise of Jeremiah 33 in verse number 3. Prayer. He, Epaphras, as we know his

113
00:09:55,239 --> 00:10:01,080
devotion, we say first he's a servant of Christ.

114
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,000
We say, second, he's a man of prayer.

115
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,760
Notice the Bible says with regard to his prayer

116
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,040
that he's always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,060
We're mindful of the truth of James 5

118
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,640
in verse 16 when the example of the prayer of Elijah

119
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,680
is mentioned here in this passage of Scripture.

120
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
And the Bible says,

121
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,160
confess your faults one to another

122
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,240
and pray one for another

123
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
that ye may be healed,

124
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,600
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
availeth much.

126
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,520
And then the Bible uses that example of Elijah.

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,120
It says he was a man of subject to like passions as we are.

128
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain.

129
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
And what happened?

130
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,600
It rained not on the earth

131
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,440
by the space of three years and six months.

132
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,020
And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain.

133
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,560
And the earth brought forth her fruit.

134
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
You know, there was another prayer of Elijah

135
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,960
in between the prayer of no rain

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,400
and the prayer of rain.

137
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,360
You know what that prayer was?

138
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,440
It was a prayer for fire.

139
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,720
Amen?

140
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,560
And what happened when he prayed that fire?

141
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,340
He said, Lord, I've spoken all these things

142
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,860
according to Thy Word.

143
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,960
Remember the servants of Baal,

144
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,940
they're running around and they're crying out

145
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,120
and they're cutting themselves

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,020
and they're doing all that they can do

147
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,240
to appease their false God

148
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,040
and nothing, nothing happens.

149
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Elijah, he says, let's fix this altar up.

150
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Bring some water.

151
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Bring some more water.

152
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,180
He prays.

153
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,420
And fire fell from heaven.

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,800
Listen, this man, Epaphras,

155
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
we speak of his devotion this morning.

156
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,880
And I believe that his devotion is revealed to us

157
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
through the way in which he's described.

158
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
And first, he's described as being a servant

159
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
of Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,920
Second, he's described as being a man of prayer.

161
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,800
I find not here in these verses of Scripture,

162
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,360
but back in chapter number one,

163
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,600
that he's described as being a faithful minister.

164
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
Look back at Colossians 1 in verse number seven.

165
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,240
The Bible says this,

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,680
as he also learned of Epaphras,

167
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,040
our dear fellow servant,

168
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,760
who is for you,

169
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,680
notice what it says,

170
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,200
a faithful minister of Christ.

171
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,920
What a great way to be described

172
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,720
as being a faithful minister.

173
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,440
The book of 1 Corinthians says that moreover,

174
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,080
it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful.

175
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,200
And we mentioned as we studied in verses seven through 11

176
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
a couple of Sundays ago,

177
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,800
dealing with these fellow workers

178
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,600
and how the faithfulness of these men was revealed to us.

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,640
And we find that Epaphras,

180
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,160
as we consider this morning his devotion,

181
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
we find that he was a servant,

182
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,800
he was a man of prayer,

183
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
but he was a faithful minister.

184
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,960
What a way to be described.

185
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,280
Servant, man of prayer, faithful minister.

186
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,440
I want you to think about his devotion.

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,200
We see that his devotion is revealed

188
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,160
through the ways in which he's described.

189
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,680
But I would say this of his devotion, number one,

190
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,000
I would say that his devotion was sincere.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,480
His devotion was sincere.

192
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,600
I believe that this man Epaphras,

193
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
had a genuine walk with God.

195
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
There was no pretense,

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,480
there was no facade,

197
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,640
there was no trying to put on an act or a show

198
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,080
for someone to pretend to be something you were not.

199
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,360
No, I believe that as we look at this man Epaphras

200
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,720
and I think about his devotion to God

201
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
and I think about his walk with God,

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,920
it was sincere.

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,400
It was genuine.

204
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
He was a man that had been born again.

205
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,600
He's a man, we don't know how he heard the Gospel,

206
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,360
we don't know when he heard the Gospel,

207
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,800
but he was a man that heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ

208
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,920
and trusted Christ as his Savior.

209
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,080
He was a man that was used by God.

210
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,720
He was a man that was a servant,

211
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,840
that was a man of prayer, that was faithful.

212
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,320
And I would say that his devotion was sincere.

213
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,320
So often, in the day and age in which we live,

214
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,560
we find that there's so often people of pretense

215
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,200
and people with facade,

216
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,920
but oh, that we just be genuine, sincere followers of Jesus Christ.

217
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
That devotion of Epaphras, I believe,

218
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,200
can be described as being sincere.

219
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
I would say this of his devotion,

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,080
not only was his devotion sincere,

221
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,360
but his devotion was obvious.

222
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,960
This is not Epaphras speaking of himself.

223
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,320
This is not Epaphras saying,

224
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,880
hey, I'm a minister of Christ, a servant of Christ.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,400
I am a man of prayer.

226
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,080
I am a faithful minister.

227
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,920
No, this is the Apostle Paul,

228
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,800
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

229
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,360
saying of Epaphras that he is a servant of Christ,

230
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,080
that he is a man of prayer,

231
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,720
that he is a faithful minister.

232
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,840
His devotion to God was obvious.

233
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,520
It was something that Paul was able to observe.

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,160
Oh, that people would see that our walk with God

235
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,760
is not only sincere, but that it's obvious.

236
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,240
That people would say,

237
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,720
as we studied a few weeks ago on Sunday evening,

238
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,600
remember just a few weeks ago in Genesis 21,

239
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,480
the Bible spoke of the way in which Abimelech

240
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
came to Abraham and said,

241
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,600
God is with thee in all that thou doest.

242
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,280
When we look at the life of Joseph,

243
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,360
remember they saw that God was with him.

244
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,960
When you begin to look at Bible characters

245
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,160
and you see that God is with them,

246
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,760
there's something obvious about their walk with God.

247
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,600
And this morning, when I think of the zeal of Epaphras,

248
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,880
when I first note his devotion

249
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,400
and understanding that his devotion is revealed

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,200
through the way in which he's described,

251
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
but I would say of his devotion

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
that it's sincere and that it's obvious.

253
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,760
I would say this, number three of his devotion,

254
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,640
his devotion is exemplary.

255
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,520
His devotion is exemplary.

256
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,840
What do we mean by that?

257
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
I believe this morning that as we read

258
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,440
just a couple of verses of Scripture

259
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,200
in Colossians 4, verses 12 and 13,

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,040
as we wrap up our text

261
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,520
in the study of the book of Colossians,

262
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,080
I mean, nearing the very end,

263
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,920
I think that this morning,

264
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,080
as we consider the devotion of this man,

265
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,320
that it should challenge us.

266
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
That each and every one of us,

267
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,600
as we look at the devotion of Epaphras,

268
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
and we'd say that it's exemplary,

269
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,360
that it should be a challenge

270
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,480
in my own personal walk with God.

271
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,920
How's my devotion to God?

272
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,040
How's my walk with God?

273
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm not asking you to tell anyone out loud

274
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,920
or to respond publicly how your walk with God is,

275
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,960
but I'm simply suggesting this morning

276
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,840
that when we look at a man

277
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,560
that is described in the manner

278
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,640
in which he is described,

279
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,840
that it ought to challenge us.

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,680
And I wonder this morning,

281
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,840
as we consider the fact that this

282
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,760
is not just Paul writing,

283
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,040
because this is Scripture.

284
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,240
This is God's Word.

285
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Therefore, it's God's saying of Epaphras.

286
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280
Yes, Paul is the human penman.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,680
Paul is the one that observed these things.

288
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,480
Paul is the one that says he sends your greetings,

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
but you understand that this is the Word of God.

290
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
You can deceive me.

291
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,160
You can deceive somebody else

292
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,480
to think that we can have this idea

293
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,080
that your walk with God is something

294
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,160
other than what it really is.

295
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,000
The church in Laodicea is mentioned here

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,160
in this text of Scripture.

297
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,760
It's mentioned in chapter two as well.

298
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
Remember, Paul had a great conflict

299
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
for those that were in Colossae,

300
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,640
but also for those that were in Laodicea.

301
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
And also, it says,

302
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,

303
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,080
Hierapolis is mentioned here in verse 13.

304
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,320
No doubt that was on the mind of Paul.

305
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,000
But we understand as the reference

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,800
to the church of the Laodiceans

307
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,880
as it's described in the book of Revelation,

308
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,840
that they had an opinion of themselves.

309
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Did they not?

310
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
Was their opinion reality?

311
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
Huh.

312
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Not in God's eyes.

313
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
Right?

314
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Church of the Laodiceans, ye say,

315
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,360
that you're increased with goods

316
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,280
and have need of nothing,

317
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
but you don't know that you're poor,

318
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,520
miserable, and naked.

319
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,360
Wow.

320
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,119
This morning as we think about

321
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,080
the devotion of Epaphras,

322
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,600
as we understand that this man

323
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,160
is described to us as being a servant of Jesus Christ,

324
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,640
that this man is described to us

325
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,200
as being a man of prayer,

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,480
of being a faithful minister.

327
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,760
His devotion was, we find, sincere,

328
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
and it was obvious,

329
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,720
but his devotion is exemplary.

330
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,840
It should challenge each and every one of us.

331
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,600
If God were to write about your devotion,

332
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,559
what would He say?

333
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,960
Not if you were to write about your devotion.

334
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,440
Not if I were to write about your devotion.

335
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,239
Not if your spouse or your children

336
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,840
were to write about your devotion.

337
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,520
But what would God say

338
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,880
if He were to write about my devotion?

339
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
About your devotion?

340
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
And here, the devotion of this man of Epaphras

341
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,720
is exemplary.

342
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,200
Oh, that it would be said of us

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,559
that we are servants of Jesus Christ.

344
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,440
Just a servant.

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
I'll do what you want me to do, dear Lord.

346
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I'll go where you want me to go.

347
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,520
I'll say what you want me to say.

348
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,360
Why?

349
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Because my life, Lord, is yours to control.

350
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,679
I'm just your servant.

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
Oh, that it be said of us that.

352
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,660
that were people of prayer.

353
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,580
I don't know a lot about that person,

354
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,500
but what I know is they can pray.

355
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,880
And they believe in prayer.

356
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,640
If there's somebody that I want to pray for me

357
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,520
as I go through a difficulty,

358
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,480
a trial, a problem in life,

359
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,720
if there's someone that I want to pray,

360
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,360
I have people that I say,

361
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,040
these are people that I know that pray.

362
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,600
Amen?

363
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,580
Faithful.

364
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,600
Faithfulness is so important in God's economy.

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,660
It really is.

366
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,460
We understand what it is to have

367
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,780
a level of importance placed upon faithfulness.

368
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,140
Do we not?

369
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,420
If you're an employer,

370
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,380
you want your employees to be faithful.

371
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,660
They show up to work.

372
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Right?

373
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,140
I mean, it's kind of a requirement.

374
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,780
You don't just come and go when you please

375
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,720
and how you want.

376
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,260
There's an expectation.

377
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,140
In employment, there's an expectation

378
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,680
in a marriage.

379
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,980
Faithfulness.

380
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,900
Correct?

381
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,460
You to be faithful to your spouse

382
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,600
and your spouse to be faithful to you.

383
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,580
Amen?

384
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,820
In God's economy,

385
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,460
faithfulness is near the top.

386
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,360
He says it's required

387
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,080
from stewards that a man be found faithful.

388
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,400
We are the stewards of the grace of God.

389
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,920
And oh, that we be good stewards

390
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,240
of the manifold grace of God.

391
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,960
The devotion of Epaphras.

392
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,120
Moving along,

393
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,360
not only do I note his devotion,

394
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,240
but I note the desire of Epaphras.

395
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
This man, Epaphras,

396
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,440
had a teaching ministry in Colossae.

397
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,560
We mentioned Colossae 1 in v. 7

398
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,800
a few minutes ago

399
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
as he was described there

400
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,040
as being a faithful minister of Christ.

401
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,880
But we find also that in v. 7 of Colossae 1

402
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
that it says,

403
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,800
as he also learned of Epaphras,

404
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,920
our dear fellow servant.

405
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
And so we understand

406
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
whether he was the pastor

407
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,680
or he just had some teaching ministry

408
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
there in Colossae,

409
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,600
we do not know for certainty.

410
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
But we do understand

411
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
that he had some level of ministry

412
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,080
there in Colossae

413
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,440
as he was teaching these believers.

414
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,760
And I note that his desire

415
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,640
is revealed to us in v. 12.

416
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
That desire is a desire

417
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,000
that is coupled with great zeal.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Passion.

419
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,400
We find that that desire

420
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,520
is revealed through the way

421
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,840
in which he prays.

422
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,400
It says that he saluteth you

423
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

424
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,640
And notice the desire.

425
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,000
Notice the means by which

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
this man Epaphras is seeking the face of God

427
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,760
on the behalf of these believers

428
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,360
that you may stand perfect

429
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
and complete in all the will of God.

430
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,320
Wow, what a desire.

431
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,240
I note that this desire

432
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,840
for the believers in Colossae

433
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
was spiritual in nature.

434
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,680
You'll note that this desire,

435
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,040
the way in which Epaphras is praying

436
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,080
for these believers in Colossae

437
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,440
is not physical.

438
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,800
It's not temporal.

439
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,840
It's spiritual.

440
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,080
So often, we are on the wrong plane.

441
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,880
We're on the temporal plane.

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,640
We're praying about things temporally.

443
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,000
We're praying about things physically.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,400
And we fail to enter the spiritual plane.

445
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,240
We fail to pray for our brothers

446
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,760
and sisters in Christ in a spiritual manner.

447
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,240
An understanding that as Paul

448
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
was writing to the believers

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,720
and speaking as to how he was praying for them,

450
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,840
turn back quickly to Colossians 1

451
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,880
and begin in v. 9 how Paul reveals to us

452
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,440
how he was praying for these believers in Colossae.

453
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,240
He says, for this cause we also

454
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,800
since the day we heard it

455
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,880
do not cease to pray for you

456
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
and to desire, notice this,

457
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,480
that you might be filled with the knowledge

458
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
of His will and all wisdom

459
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
and spiritual understanding.

460
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Well, that's a good prayer request, is it not?

461
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
That's a good way to be praying

462
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,600
for your brothers and sisters in Christ.

463
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,800
That your, notice where he says

464
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,040
that you might be filled with the knowledge

465
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,520
of His will and all wisdom

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,400
and spiritual understanding.

467
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,120
He continues that you might walk

468
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,040
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.

469
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,760
Well, that's a good way to pray as well.

470
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,040
Being fruitful in every good work.

471
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,760
Increasing in the knowledge of God.

472
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,520
If you read the book of Philippians,

473
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,160
there are two occasions,

474
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,800
excuse me, the book of Ephesians.

475
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,960
If you read the book of Ephesians,

476
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
there are two occasions in the book of Ephesians

477
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,880
where Paul's prayer for the believers

478
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,240
in Ephesus is recorded for us.

479
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
And you know how Paul prays

480
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,600
for the believers in Ephesus?

481
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,920
The same way he does for the believers in Colossae.

482
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,240
He prays for them spiritually.

483
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,640
He's concerned about their walk with God.

484
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,240
He's concerned about their spiritual well-being.

485
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm not suggesting that he cares nothing

486
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,840
about their current circumstances

487
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,400
or their health or some physical issues,

488
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,320
but primarily he's concerned about that spiritual.

489
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,720
And we find the same thing

490
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,600
as we look at Epaphras here in the fourth chapter

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
and we note the desire of this individual

492
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,160
and we find that he's always laboring fervently,

493
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,680
praying and seeking the face of God

494
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
and the way in which he's praying

495
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,920
for these believers in Colossae

496
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,240
is that they would stand perfect

497
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,680
and complete in all the will of God.

498
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,440
Wow.

499
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,880
I mentioned already some of Colossians 1,

500
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
but I want to draw your attention

501
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
to verse number 28 of the first chapter

502
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,480
of the book of Colossians

503
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,860
and I want you to see what the Bible tells us

504
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,200
about the ministry of Paul as he describes it here

505
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,040
in this passage of Scripture.

506
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,000
In Colossians 1 and verse 28,

507
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,840
Paul says,

508
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,120
whom we preach,

509
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,560
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom

510
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,560
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

511
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,160
Begin to think about the spiritual nature

512
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,560
of the desire of Epaphras,

513
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,560
the consistent desire of Epaphras

514
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,960
to that of Paul's desire for the believers in Colossae.

515
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,080
And as we think about this desire

516
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,880
and we see how that this desire is zeroed in

517
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,840
through the way in which he's praying.

518
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I say this morning that if we are to be people of prayer,

519
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,320
if we evaluate our prayer lives,

520
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,160
how are we praying for our brothers and sisters in Christ?

521
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Are we praying for our brothers and sisters in Christ

522
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,760
in this spiritual manner?

523
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,520
That our brothers and sisters in Christ

524
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,200
would stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

525
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,560
That our brothers and sisters in Christ

526
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,240
would know the mind of Christ,

527
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
that they would know the will of God,

528
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,160
that they would do the will of God,

529
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,240
that they would be followers of Jesus Christ.

530
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,480
So often, we as believers,

531
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,840
and I would say I as a pastor receive criticism for,

532
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,360
well, you just want people to come to church

533
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,640
so you can feel good about it.

534
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,680
So much greater than that.

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,920
It's so much greater than that.

536
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,720
I don't go and knock on someone's door.

537
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,520
I don't give someone a gospel tract.

538
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,840
I don't invite them to church.

539
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,920
I don't pray for our church family

540
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,240
that they'd be in church and that they'd read their Bibles

541
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,520
and they would seek the face of God through prayer.

542
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,240
I don't pray that way so that I can gain something benefit.

543
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,640
It's because I'm concerned about the spiritual wellbeing

544
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,840
of others.

545
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
Why do we take the gospel to a lost and dying world?

546
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Because the Bible tells us that the dead,

547
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,960
small and great will stand before the great white throne

548
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,080
and whosoever is not written in the book of life

549
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,640
will be cast into the lake of fire.

550
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,280
So why do we have a desire to preach the gospel?

551
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,920
Because souls are dying and they need the truth.

552
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,760
Amen?

553
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,160
And by the way, my responsibility and your responsibility

554
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,360
is to be the mouthpiece, to be the one that gives the truth.

555
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,680
I can't make anyone get saved.

556
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,680
And God doesn't hold me accountable

557
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
for making them get saved.

558
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,320
He just holds me accountable for giving the truth.

559
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,680
You understand that if you read your Bible this week

560
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,400
or if you don't read your Bible this week,

561
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,760
it doesn't affect my spiritual walk with God.

562
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,860
It doesn't.

563
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,140
But I pray that you read your Bible.

564
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,740
I encourage you to read your Bible.

565
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,700
We preach about the importance of reading your Bible.

566
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,540
Why?

567
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,220
Because the entrance of thy word giveth light.

568
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,700
Because the word of God is quick and powerful

569
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,300
and sharper than the two-edged sword.

570
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,660
Because the word of God is the word of God.

571
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,620
It's given by inspiration of God and it is profitable.

572
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,940
And therefore, it is good for you

573
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,660
just like it's good for me.

574
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,820
And I pray that you pray.

575
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,660
Why?

576
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,060
Because you need to walk with God

577
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,740
and you need to seek the face of God.

578
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,260
I pray that you would know the will of God.

579
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,820
To know the mind of Christ and to know the will of God

580
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,260
is to know this book.

581
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,580
Amen?

582
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,700
I pray that God would keep you from the evil one.

583
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,260
That God would help you to put on the whole armor of God

584
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,660
that you would be able to stand in the evil one.

585
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:07,780
day and oh how we're living in an evil day amen and we need to pray one for

586
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,980
another when's the last time we've prayed for someone on this plane

587
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,740
spiritually that he's gonna go and he's gonna go and you're gonna go into a

588
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,020
world that you're gonna be bombarded by the devil by the enemy and we need the

589
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:32,260
armor of God but we pray on a physical plane someone's got a cold I'm not

590
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:38,180
trying to minimize a cold please understand what I'm saying we need to

591
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:45,660
get on the spiritual because it's a spiritual battle you know how Ephesians

592
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,900
turn over to Ephesians 6 because I want you to see how Paul ends under the

593
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,540
inspiration of Holy Spirit of God the passage dealing with the whole armor of

594
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:04,980
God we're to put on the whole armor of God but he says in verse number 18

595
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:13,100
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching

596
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,860
thereunto with all perseverance and supplications what are the next three

597
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:24,580
words for all Saints can you pray for yourself with regard to the spiritual

598
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:31,220
battle yes and you should amen but you know what the admonition is who to pray

599
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:38,420
for all the Saints why because they're facing spiritual warfare and we get on

600
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,860
that plane of praying spiritually one for another and Paul says let me tell

601
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,140
you about a path for us he's one of you he's a servant of Jesus Christ he

602
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,660
saluted you he sends his greetings but he's praying always for you fervently

603
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:03,860
what that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God Wow if

604
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:11,540
someone tells me they're praying for me that way that encourages me amen because

605
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,380
if I know that our people are praying for me that I would stand complete in

606
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,580
all the will of God as I understand as Paul prayed in Colossians 1 that they

607
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,620
would be filled with the knowledge of God then when I enter into my time with

608
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,660
God and I'm seeking his face and I'm reading his word and God is teaching me

609
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,740
that's not only answering my prayers but that's answering your prayers because

610
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:39,860
you prayed that God would give me truth amen it's good for me to pray as I begin

611
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,700
my Bible reading as I did this morning Lord open how mine eyes that I may

612
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,020
behold wondrous things out of thy word speak Lord for thy servant heareth God

613
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:57,180
help me to understand your word and to do your word I pray that for myself but

614
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,620
we ought to be praying that for each other and then God works and somebody

615
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,340
says can I tell you I love it when this happens brother summer if you probably

616
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,140
have this happen the ministry too can I tell you I was reading my Bible and God

617
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,660
showed me something where do you get stuck I get stuck on I was in my Bible

618
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,620
it encourages me seriously you know you can read your Bible through in about 60

619
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,940
hours it's kind of a just you can just do the math and figure it out you can

620
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:35,380
get CDs and you can hear them it's about 60 hours statistics tell us I've never

621
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,860
been asked so I'll put that disclaimer you may not have been asked either but

622
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,100
statistics tell us that like less than half of the people that regularly go to

623
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,780
church have read the Bible through cover-to-cover this book is the mind of

624
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,620
God and as we pray one front of their spiritually that we would have that we

625
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,940
would stand complete perfect and complete and all the will of God and we

626
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,500
have this this desire that a path for us has and we say God give me that desire

627
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,020
for my fellow brethren for my brothers and sisters in Christ that I would

628
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,100
desire that they would grow spiritually that they would mature spiritually and

629
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:27,740
help me to not only desire that but help me to pray that way for them amen as I

630
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:38,620
look at a path for us I see a man who just humbly followed God I see a man

631
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,780
that's mentioned just three times Colossians 1 Colossians 4 and Philemon

632
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:54,140
his life was about Christ he had a a close walk with God it's revealed to us

633
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,660
through the ways in which he's described his devotion to God was

634
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:07,340
sincere was obvious it's exemplary but he had a desire his desire was not even

635
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:15,740
just for himself it was for his brethren and his desire was that they would they

636
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,700
would be perfect and complete and all the will of God we've had as our theme

637
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:28,180
all year complete in Christ from Colossians 2 in verse 10 that we'd

638
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:35,620
understand we are complete in him but that we would continue to grow not only

639
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:41,660
knowing the will of God but doing the will of God and this morning as we look

640
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:47,620
at these two verses of Scripture I really hope that first we'd be

641
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:58,780
encouraged by such a soldier of the cross amen his life encourages me his

642
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,300
life challenges me but but first I want to think about that encouragement oh we

643
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,980
should be encouraged by a man like a path for us I think he encouraged Paul I

644
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,380
believe that I believe that when Paul was there in Roman prison and a path

645
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,420
first came and brought him the news and as Paul observed his walk with God I

646
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,980
think Paul was encouraged and we too should be encouraged by a follower of

647
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:32,140
Jesus Christ man that desires God hungering and thirsting after

648
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,340
righteousness as the psalmist said in Psalm 42 is the heart panteth after the

649
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:46,500
water brooks so panteth my heart after thee Oh God someone made this statement

650
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,620
to me I was having a meeting actually last week and someone made this

651
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,660
statement to me and it was it was impactful it actually caused me to stop

652
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:04,300
right in our conversation and kind of rewind and let's talk about that the

653
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,700
statement that was made was this we ought to be jealous about our walk with

654
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,340
God and I thought man that's a good thought to be jealous about my walk with

655
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:24,140
God to have such desire and such passion to follow the Lord Jesus Christ that I'm

656
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,980
jealous I don't want anything to interfere with that and to understand

657
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,140
that that my walk with God is my walk with God and your walk with God is your

658
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,100
walk with God and to have that perspective with regard to our walk and

659
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:45,620
we see in a path first I don't think he was trying to impress Paul you know I

660
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,940
don't think that because I'm not God wouldn't put it in the word like he did

661
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:54,500
because you know what God knows the heart he knows the motive amen so if a

662
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,100
path first was just I'm gonna impress the Apostle Paul and I'm gonna show him

663
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,420
I know how to pray and this that and the other thing Oh God of our fathers

664
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:08,180
Abraham and Isaac no no no God would have included it in the word his walk

665
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:15,260
was sincere passionate we're encouraged by that but this morning I hope that

666
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:23,540
we'd be challenged by it and that we'd evaluate our own lives and say if just a

667
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,180
couple of verses I didn't count the number of words but if just that many

668
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:34,700
words were written about me from God what would he have to say about my life

669
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,820
we mentioned in Sunday school last week we mentioned again this morning how that

670
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:48,340
Jesus marveled at the faith of the centurion in Matthew 8 he says to those

671
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,100
that were there the disciples I've not found so great faith no not in all of

672
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,660
Israel there are other times in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ that he

673
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:06,740
marveled at their unbelief I would much rather God marvel at my faith than at my

674
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:16,060
unbelief amen how long will it be air you believe me and so this morning as we

675
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,380
are encouraged by the life and testimony of a paraphrase the zeal of this man I

676
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:29,860
hope that we also are challenged say Oh God help me to have that kind of devotion

677
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:39,900
help my walk with you to be sincere genuine help it to be obvious help me to

678
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:47,260
be a person a man a woman of prayer a child of prayer help me to serve you

679
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,100
faithfully and then that God would give us that spiritual desire one for another

680
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,420
and then it would transform the way in which we pray because we're praying I'm

681
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
not suggesting we stop

682
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,300
worrying about physical needs, I'm just simply suggesting that we enter a new dimension,

683
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:14,100
if you will, we get onto the spiritual plane, and understanding that we are to be in prayer

684
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:21,420
one for another, even as Epaphras was for those believers, and it's spiritual in nature,

685
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,900
it's not temporal, it's not physical, it's spiritual, oh, that God would help us.

686
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,620
Only two points this morning, because I have like six or seven tonight, try to balance

687
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
it out, amen?

688
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
Let's pray together.

689
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,780
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for the testimony of this

690
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:51,740
man Epaphras, and as we look at these couple of verses of Scripture, my heart is encouraged.

691
00:40:51,740 --> 00:41:07,260
I thank you for his example, his walk with you, his devotion, I thank you for his desire,

692
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,420
for his brothers and sisters in Christ, Lord, I pray this morning that you'd use your word

693
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:23,380
to challenge us, that we would truly evaluate our own walk with you, that we'd evaluate

694
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:33,500
our prayer lives, how is it that we're praying, are we praying fervently, are we praying faithfully,

695
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,580
are we praying on this spiritual plane?

696
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:48,140
Lord, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only, help us to make some decisions

697
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:54,660
this morning that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ, that would cause us

698
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,100
to impact eternity.

699
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,420
I pray that you'd move and work in the moments of our invitation as only you can.

700
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,540
We'll give you the honor and the glory for every decision that is made, it's in Christ's

701
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,580
name we pray, would you stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed, we have this time

702
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,540
at the end of our services to give you an opportunity to respond.

703
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,180
Maybe this morning you need to come to this old-fashioned altar and ask the Lord to help

704
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:26,740
you as you evaluate your own walk with God, to help you in your prayer life.

705
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,540
Maybe this morning you just want to thank God for the opportunity to pray, the privilege

706
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,380
that is ours to serve Him.

707
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,740
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you, I can know for

708
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,780
sure that heaven's your home.

709
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:51,980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
