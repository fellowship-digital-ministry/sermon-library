WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.239
at verses 7 through 11 of this passage of Scripture and dealt with my fellow

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.439
workers. And we talked about the recognition of those fellow workers.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:17.719
Paul references them, he talks about them. We spoke about not only the recognition

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.840
but then the role. What was the responsibility? What was it that these

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.959
fellow workers were doing? And then we spoke of the reward for the fellow

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:30.959
workers. And what a blessing to know that our God has given us, not only it's

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:35.639
through His grace and His Spirit that we serve Him, but then He's given us the

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:41.080
truth that He will reward us for our faithful service. And what a blessing to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.000
understand that truth. This morning we're gonna look at verses 12 and 13 and we're

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.759
gonna look specifically at Epaphras. Notice in verse 12 the Bible says,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:55.000
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always laboring

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.200
fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.120
will of God. For I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.839
that are in Laodicea and them in Heropolis. As we look at these verses of

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:15.239
Scripture, we're reminded that we first meet Epaphras or learn of Epaphras in

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:19.199
the first chapter of the book of Colossians. We understand also that he's

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:24.160
mentioned in the book of Philemon and these are the three references of this

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.839
particular character that we find throughout the Word of God. Once in

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.839
Colossians 1, here in Colossians 4, and then briefly mentioned in the book of

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:36.559
Philemon. You may remember that it was through Epaphras that the Apostle Paul

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:41.720
learned about these group of believers or this group of believers in Colossae.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.959
Remember in the first chapter that Paul, we mentioned this as we began studying

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.120
the book of Colossians, that Paul did not personally know the believers in

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.760
Colossae. Paul was not on a missionary journey and went to the city of Colossae

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.559
and planted a church. It didn't work that way. Now we understand with some of the

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.559
books that we read and some of the churches, you think about the church in

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.839
Ephesus, you think about the church in Philippi, these are places where Paul

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:16.000
went specifically on missionary journeys and knew the people personally that he's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.880
writing to. We can think about the churches in the region of Galatias. The

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.720
book of Galatians is written to those churches in those four cities and during

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.479
the first missionary journey, the Apostle Paul visited those particular

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.720
locations and souls were saved and churches were established and what a joy.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.240
But here in the book of Colossians, we understand that Paul never was in the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.479
city of Colossae. He heard about these believers, this group, this church in

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:49.639
Colossae through Epaphras. We're not sure, it's not a hundred percent clear

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.520
whether Epaphras simply visited the Apostle Paul while he was in Roman

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.199
prison or if Epaphras was imprisoned as well. But we understand that this book of

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.360
Colossians is one of those books that we refer to as being a prison epistle and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.679
the Apostle Paul is in prison writing to this church and he mentions in the first

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.759
chapter how that from the first day that he heard about their faith that he was

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:21.440
rejoicing with them and he was praying for them and he gives them distinctly in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.279
the first chapter how he was praying for them and his desire for them and all of

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:33.039
those things that he knew about this body of believers including the conflict

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:38.320
that they were dealing with because of the entry of false teachers was a result

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.919
of the ministry of Epaphras bringing that word to the Apostle Paul. I believe

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.160
that as we look at these two verses of Scripture here in the fourth chapter as

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.639
we near the end of our study of the book of Colossians we would find that from

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.199
these two verses of Scripture it seems quite evident that Paul spent some time

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.720
with Epaphras and I believe that as we look at these verses of Scripture that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.479
we are given insight to the character of this man. We find that it was that it

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.000
seems as we look at these verses of Scripture that Epaphras was a genuine

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.160
sincere follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am sure this morning that

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.200
Epaphras was an encouragement to the Apostle Paul. And you think about the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.040
ways in which God allows believers brethren to encourage one another and no

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:35.679
doubt that while Paul was imprisoned in Rome because of his faith we find that

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:41.920
God allowed for he and Epaphras to cross paths and what an encouragement it must

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.760
have been. As we look at these verses of Scripture it seems as if as I mentioned

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.959
a moment ago that there's some time that they spent one with another for we find

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.559
that some of the statements that are made are not made simply after a brief

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:03.399
30-minute kind of interaction. We find that there was definitely some length of

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.640
time there and you'll notice in verse number 13 that it says that he speaking

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.519
of Epaphras hath a great zeal for you as you've noticed on the back of the

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:16.920
bulletin this morning on a preacher message that I've simply entitled the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.359
zeal of Epaphras. The zeal of Epaphras. To have zeal is to have passion. We find

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:27.480
that this man was a man of passion. As we begin to look at this man and look at

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.320
what Paul says of Epaphras if you're taking notes this morning I want you to

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.640
first note the devotion of Epaphras. Note his devotion. I believe that the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.559
devotion of Epaphras is revealed to us through the way in which he is described.

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:48.040
Notice the Bible tells us that he is one of you. In other words that Epaphras had

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.600
been in Colossae. He had ministered there and we find that he is one of you but

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.040
notice this phrase, a servant of Christ. What a great way to be known. In fact

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.559
oftentimes as you read books of the Bible and especially in the New

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:08.720
Testament epistles you'll find that the particular human penman of those

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.519
particular books will begin by saying a servant of Jesus Christ. Paul, a servant

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:20.600
of Jesus Christ. James, a servant of Jesus Christ. Peter, a servant. You think about

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:26.480
the title of being a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. We mentioned last week as

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.320
we noted some reasons to rejoice and we spoke about being thankful for his

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.079
person that he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and to consider this morning

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:40.160
that we have the ability, the opportunity, the privilege to be his

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:48.200
servant. Wow. Many times the term servant is a term that is used in a negative

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.700
context. It's looked down upon but to consider this morning that we are

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.200
servants of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, to consider the privilege that

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.000
is ours to be his servant, it is a great truth of the Word of God and we find

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.040
that the Bible says that he, Epaphras, is a servant of Christ. I find also the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.040
Bible tells us here in verse number 12 that he's a man of prayer. A man of

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.119
prayer. Notice what the Bible says. He says that he saluteth you, he sends his

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:31.000
greetings, but notice this phrase, always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.559
The Word of God reveals much to us on the subject of prayer. We find that Jesus

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:43.040
often is praying. We find that of all the things that the disciples could have

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:50.959
asked the Lord to teach them, they make this request, Lord, teach us to pray. We

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:56.040
find that the Lord Jesus Christ was a man of prayer. He prayed. He gave us that

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.640
example that we should follow his steps. We find that the Word of God contains a

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.600
number of promises with regard to prayer. In fact, as you read and study the Word

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.640
of God, you can read and study the prayers of God's people and you can see

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.399
the way in which they pour out their heart to God and the way in which the

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:23.119
hand of God is moved through the prayers of his people. God has chosen that

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:29.079
prayer is the vehicle by which his hand is moved. Isn't that awesome? And when you

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:32.719
begin to think about the privilege again of prayer, we mentioned about the

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:37.159
privilege of being a servant of Jesus Christ, but you know that it is a unique

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.599
privilege that is reserved for the child of God to pray to the God of heaven. What

00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:50.599
a privilege. That at any time, for any reason, we can go to God in prayer and we

00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:54.760
can stay there as long as we want. Aren't you thankful for that? He never says your

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:03.119
time is up. He never says, wait, I'm busy. No, no. At any time, at any moment, for any

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:09.719
reason, for as long as we want, we can come boldly to the throne of grace. Why?

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:14.719
Because he's given us access through his death, burial, and resurrection. We have

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:20.159
direct access to the throne room of heaven and we can bring our petitions

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:26.000
before the face of God who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.919
ask or think. He said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:36.159
thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. You read over in the book of

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:41.000
Lamentations and you read how the Bible tells us that Jeremiah cried out to God

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.200
and how God answered. It's a direct just example of the the fulfillment of that

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.239
promise of Jeremiah 33 in verse number 3. Prayer. He, Epaphras, as we know his

00:09:55.239 --> 00:10:01.080
devotion, we say first he's a servant of Christ.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.000
We say, second, he's a man of prayer.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.760
Notice the Bible says with regard to his prayer

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.040
that he's always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.060
We're mindful of the truth of James 5

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.640
in verse 16 when the example of the prayer of Elijah

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.680
is mentioned here in this passage of Scripture.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.520
And the Bible says,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.160
confess your faults one to another

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.240
and pray one for another

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.840
that ye may be healed,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.600
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.440
availeth much.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.520
And then the Bible uses that example of Elijah.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.120
It says he was a man of subject to like passions as we are.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.680
And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.520
And what happened?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.600
It rained not on the earth

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.440
by the space of three years and six months.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.020
And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.560
And the earth brought forth her fruit.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.400
You know, there was another prayer of Elijah

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.960
in between the prayer of no rain

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.400
and the prayer of rain.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.360
You know what that prayer was?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.440
It was a prayer for fire.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.720
Amen?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.560
And what happened when he prayed that fire?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.340
He said, Lord, I've spoken all these things

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.860
according to Thy Word.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.960
Remember the servants of Baal,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.940
they're running around and they're crying out

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.120
and they're cutting themselves

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.020
and they're doing all that they can do

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.240
to appease their false God

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.040
and nothing, nothing happens.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.880
Elijah, he says, let's fix this altar up.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.280
Bring some water.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.560
Bring some more water.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.180
He prays.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.420
And fire fell from heaven.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.800
Listen, this man, Epaphras,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.400
we speak of his devotion this morning.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.880
And I believe that his devotion is revealed to us

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.720
through the way in which he's described.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.200
And first, he's described as being a servant

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.880
of Jesus Christ.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.920
Second, he's described as being a man of prayer.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.800
I find not here in these verses of Scripture,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.360
but back in chapter number one,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.600
that he's described as being a faithful minister.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.280
Look back at Colossians 1 in verse number seven.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.240
The Bible says this,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.680
as he also learned of Epaphras,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.040
our dear fellow servant,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.760
who is for you,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.680
notice what it says,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.200
a faithful minister of Christ.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.920
What a great way to be described

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.720
as being a faithful minister.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.440
The book of 1 Corinthians says that moreover,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.080
it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.200
And we mentioned as we studied in verses seven through 11

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.840
a couple of Sundays ago,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.800
dealing with these fellow workers

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.600
and how the faithfulness of these men was revealed to us.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.640
And we find that Epaphras,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.160
as we consider this morning his devotion,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
we find that he was a servant,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.800
he was a man of prayer,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.560
but he was a faithful minister.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.960
What a way to be described.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.280
Servant, man of prayer, faithful minister.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.440
I want you to think about his devotion.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.200
We see that his devotion is revealed

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.160
through the ways in which he's described.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.680
But I would say this of his devotion, number one,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.000
I would say that his devotion was sincere.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.480
His devotion was sincere.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.600
I believe that this man Epaphras,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.360
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.480
had a genuine walk with God.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.000
There was no pretense,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.480
there was no facade,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.640
there was no trying to put on an act or a show

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.080
for someone to pretend to be something you were not.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.360
No, I believe that as we look at this man Epaphras

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.720
and I think about his devotion to God

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.000
and I think about his walk with God,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.920
it was sincere.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.400
It was genuine.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.120
He was a man that had been born again.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.600
He's a man, we don't know how he heard the Gospel,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.360
we don't know when he heard the Gospel,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.800
but he was a man that heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.920
and trusted Christ as his Savior.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.080
He was a man that was used by God.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.720
He was a man that was a servant,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.840
that was a man of prayer, that was faithful.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.320
And I would say that his devotion was sincere.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:21.320
So often, in the day and age in which we live,

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.560
we find that there's so often people of pretense

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.200
and people with facade,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.920
but oh, that we just be genuine, sincere followers of Jesus Christ.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.160
That devotion of Epaphras, I believe,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.200
can be described as being sincere.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.000
I would say this of his devotion,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.080
not only was his devotion sincere,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.360
but his devotion was obvious.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.960
This is not Epaphras speaking of himself.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.320
This is not Epaphras saying,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.880
hey, I'm a minister of Christ, a servant of Christ.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.400
I am a man of prayer.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.080
I am a faithful minister.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.920
No, this is the Apostle Paul,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.800
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.360
saying of Epaphras that he is a servant of Christ,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.080
that he is a man of prayer,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.720
that he is a faithful minister.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.840
His devotion to God was obvious.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.520
It was something that Paul was able to observe.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.160
Oh, that people would see that our walk with God

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.760
is not only sincere, but that it's obvious.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.240
That people would say,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.720
as we studied a few weeks ago on Sunday evening,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.600
remember just a few weeks ago in Genesis 21,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.480
the Bible spoke of the way in which Abimelech

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.680
came to Abraham and said,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.600
God is with thee in all that thou doest.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.280
When we look at the life of Joseph,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.360
remember they saw that God was with him.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.960
When you begin to look at Bible characters

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.160
and you see that God is with them,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.760
there's something obvious about their walk with God.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.600
And this morning, when I think of the zeal of Epaphras,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.880
when I first note his devotion

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.400
and understanding that his devotion is revealed

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.200
through the way in which he's described,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.000
but I would say of his devotion

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.800
that it's sincere and that it's obvious.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.760
I would say this, number three of his devotion,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.640
his devotion is exemplary.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.520
His devotion is exemplary.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.840
What do we mean by that?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.480
I believe this morning that as we read

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.440
just a couple of verses of Scripture

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.200
in Colossians 4, verses 12 and 13,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.040
as we wrap up our text

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.520
in the study of the book of Colossians,

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.080
I mean, nearing the very end,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.920
I think that this morning,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.080
as we consider the devotion of this man,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.320
that it should challenge us.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.720
That each and every one of us,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.600
as we look at the devotion of Epaphras,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.800
and we'd say that it's exemplary,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.360
that it should be a challenge

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.480
in my own personal walk with God.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.920
How's my devotion to God?

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.040
How's my walk with God?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.720
I'm not asking you to tell anyone out loud

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.920
or to respond publicly how your walk with God is,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.960
but I'm simply suggesting this morning

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.840
that when we look at a man

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.560
that is described in the manner

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.640
in which he is described,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.840
that it ought to challenge us.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.680
And I wonder this morning,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.840
as we consider the fact that this

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.760
is not just Paul writing,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.040
because this is Scripture.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.240
This is God's Word.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.040
Therefore, it's God's saying of Epaphras.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.280
Yes, Paul is the human penman.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.680
Paul is the one that observed these things.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.480
Paul is the one that says he sends your greetings,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.160
but you understand that this is the Word of God.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.680
You can deceive me.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.160
You can deceive somebody else

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.480
to think that we can have this idea

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.080
that your walk with God is something

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.160
other than what it really is.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.000
The church in Laodicea is mentioned here

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.160
in this text of Scripture.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.760
It's mentioned in chapter two as well.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.440
Remember, Paul had a great conflict

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.280
for those that were in Colossae,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.640
but also for those that were in Laodicea.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.000
And also, it says,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.400
as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.080
Hierapolis is mentioned here in verse 13.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.320
No doubt that was on the mind of Paul.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.000
But we understand as the reference

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.800
to the church of the Laodiceans

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.880
as it's described in the book of Revelation,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.840
that they had an opinion of themselves.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
Did they not?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.440
Was their opinion reality?

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.360
Huh.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
Not in God's eyes.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.600
Right?

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.160
Church of the Laodiceans, ye say,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.360
that you're increased with goods

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.280
and have need of nothing,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.160
but you don't know that you're poor,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.520
miserable, and naked.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.360
Wow.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:49.119
This morning as we think about

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:51.080
the devotion of Epaphras,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.600
as we understand that this man

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.160
is described to us as being a servant of Jesus Christ,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.640
that this man is described to us

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.200
as being a man of prayer,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.480
of being a faithful minister.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.760
His devotion was, we find, sincere,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.880
and it was obvious,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.720
but his devotion is exemplary.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.840
It should challenge each and every one of us.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.600
If God were to write about your devotion,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.559
what would He say?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.960
Not if you were to write about your devotion.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.440
Not if I were to write about your devotion.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.239
Not if your spouse or your children

00:19:25.239 --> 00:19:26.840
were to write about your devotion.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.520
But what would God say

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.880
if He were to write about my devotion?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.160
About your devotion?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.520
And here, the devotion of this man of Epaphras

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.720
is exemplary.

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:41.200
Oh, that it would be said of us

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.559
that we are servants of Jesus Christ.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.440
Just a servant.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.400
I'll do what you want me to do, dear Lord.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.400
I'll go where you want me to go.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.520
I'll say what you want me to say.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.360
Why?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.360
Because my life, Lord, is yours to control.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.679
I'm just your servant.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.360
Oh, that it be said of us that.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.660
that were people of prayer.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.580
I don't know a lot about that person,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.500
but what I know is they can pray.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.880
And they believe in prayer.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.640
If there's somebody that I want to pray for me

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.520
as I go through a difficulty,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.480
a trial, a problem in life,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.720
if there's someone that I want to pray,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.360
I have people that I say,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.040
these are people that I know that pray.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.600
Amen?

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.580
Faithful.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.600
Faithfulness is so important in God's economy.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.660
It really is.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.460
We understand what it is to have

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.780
a level of importance placed upon faithfulness.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.140
Do we not?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.420
If you're an employer,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.380
you want your employees to be faithful.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.660
They show up to work.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.660
Right?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.140
I mean, it's kind of a requirement.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.780
You don't just come and go when you please

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.720
and how you want.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.260
There's an expectation.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.140
In employment, there's an expectation

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.680
in a marriage.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.980
Faithfulness.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.900
Correct?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.460
You to be faithful to your spouse

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.600
and your spouse to be faithful to you.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.580
Amen?

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.820
In God's economy,

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.460
faithfulness is near the top.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.360
He says it's required

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.080
from stewards that a man be found faithful.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.400
We are the stewards of the grace of God.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.920
And oh, that we be good stewards

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.240
of the manifold grace of God.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.960
The devotion of Epaphras.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.120
Moving along,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.360
not only do I note his devotion,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.240
but I note the desire of Epaphras.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.360
This man, Epaphras,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.440
had a teaching ministry in Colossae.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.560
We mentioned Colossae 1 in v. 7

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.800
a few minutes ago

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.880
as he was described there

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.040
as being a faithful minister of Christ.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.880
But we find also that in v. 7 of Colossae 1

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.880
that it says,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.800
as he also learned of Epaphras,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.920
our dear fellow servant.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.920
And so we understand

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.280
whether he was the pastor

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.680
or he just had some teaching ministry

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.720
there in Colossae,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.600
we do not know for certainty.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600
But we do understand

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.880
that he had some level of ministry

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.080
there in Colossae

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.440
as he was teaching these believers.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.760
And I note that his desire

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.640
is revealed to us in v. 12.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640
That desire is a desire

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.000
that is coupled with great zeal.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.840
Passion.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.400
We find that that desire

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.520
is revealed through the way

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.840
in which he prays.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.400
It says that he saluteth you

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.520
always laboring fervently for you in prayers.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.640
And notice the desire.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.000
Notice the means by which

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.800
this man Epaphras is seeking the face of God

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.760
on the behalf of these believers

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.360
that you may stand perfect

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.880
and complete in all the will of God.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.320
Wow, what a desire.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.240
I note that this desire

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.840
for the believers in Colossae

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.600
was spiritual in nature.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.680
You'll note that this desire,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.040
the way in which Epaphras is praying

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.080
for these believers in Colossae

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.440
is not physical.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.800
It's not temporal.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.840
It's spiritual.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.080
So often, we are on the wrong plane.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.880
We're on the temporal plane.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.640
We're praying about things temporally.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.000
We're praying about things physically.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.400
And we fail to enter the spiritual plane.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.240
We fail to pray for our brothers

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.760
and sisters in Christ in a spiritual manner.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.240
An understanding that as Paul

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.160
was writing to the believers

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.720
and speaking as to how he was praying for them,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.840
turn back quickly to Colossians 1

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.880
and begin in v. 9 how Paul reveals to us

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.440
how he was praying for these believers in Colossae.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.240
He says, for this cause we also

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.800
since the day we heard it

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.880
do not cease to pray for you

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.280
and to desire, notice this,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.480
that you might be filled with the knowledge

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.400
of His will and all wisdom

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.200
and spiritual understanding.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.640
Well, that's a good prayer request, is it not?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.000
That's a good way to be praying

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.600
for your brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.800
That your, notice where he says

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.040
that you might be filled with the knowledge

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.520
of His will and all wisdom

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.400
and spiritual understanding.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.120
He continues that you might walk

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.040
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.760
Well, that's a good way to pray as well.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.040
Being fruitful in every good work.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.760
Increasing in the knowledge of God.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.520
If you read the book of Philippians,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.160
there are two occasions,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.800
excuse me, the book of Ephesians.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.960
If you read the book of Ephesians,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.840
there are two occasions in the book of Ephesians

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.880
where Paul's prayer for the believers

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.240
in Ephesus is recorded for us.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240
And you know how Paul prays

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.600
for the believers in Ephesus?

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.920
The same way he does for the believers in Colossae.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.240
He prays for them spiritually.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.640
He's concerned about their walk with God.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.240
He's concerned about their spiritual well-being.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.880
I'm not suggesting that he cares nothing

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.840
about their current circumstances

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.400
or their health or some physical issues,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.320
but primarily he's concerned about that spiritual.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.720
And we find the same thing

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.600
as we look at Epaphras here in the fourth chapter

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.440
and we note the desire of this individual

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.160
and we find that he's always laboring fervently,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.680
praying and seeking the face of God

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.400
and the way in which he's praying

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.920
for these believers in Colossae

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.240
is that they would stand perfect

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.680
and complete in all the will of God.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.440
Wow.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.880
I mentioned already some of Colossians 1,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.560
but I want to draw your attention

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.560
to verse number 28 of the first chapter

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.480
of the book of Colossians

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.860
and I want you to see what the Bible tells us

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.200
about the ministry of Paul as he describes it here

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.040
in this passage of Scripture.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.000
In Colossians 1 and verse 28,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.840
Paul says,

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.120
whom we preach,

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.560
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.560
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.160
Begin to think about the spiritual nature

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.560
of the desire of Epaphras,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.560
the consistent desire of Epaphras

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.960
to that of Paul's desire for the believers in Colossae.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.080
And as we think about this desire

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.880
and we see how that this desire is zeroed in

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.840
through the way in which he's praying.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.760
I say this morning that if we are to be people of prayer,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.320
if we evaluate our prayer lives,

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.160
how are we praying for our brothers and sisters in Christ?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.560
Are we praying for our brothers and sisters in Christ

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.760
in this spiritual manner?

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.520
That our brothers and sisters in Christ

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.200
would stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.560
That our brothers and sisters in Christ

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.240
would know the mind of Christ,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.320
that they would know the will of God,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.160
that they would do the will of God,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.240
that they would be followers of Jesus Christ.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.480
So often, we as believers,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.840
and I would say I as a pastor receive criticism for,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.360
well, you just want people to come to church

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.640
so you can feel good about it.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.680
So much greater than that.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.920
It's so much greater than that.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.720
I don't go and knock on someone's door.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.520
I don't give someone a gospel tract.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.840
I don't invite them to church.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.920
I don't pray for our church family

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.240
that they'd be in church and that they'd read their Bibles

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.520
and they would seek the face of God through prayer.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.240
I don't pray that way so that I can gain something benefit.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.640
It's because I'm concerned about the spiritual wellbeing

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.840
of others.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.480
Why do we take the gospel to a lost and dying world?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.720
Because the Bible tells us that the dead,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.960
small and great will stand before the great white throne

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.080
and whosoever is not written in the book of life

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.640
will be cast into the lake of fire.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.280
So why do we have a desire to preach the gospel?

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.920
Because souls are dying and they need the truth.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.760
Amen?

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.160
And by the way, my responsibility and your responsibility

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.360
is to be the mouthpiece, to be the one that gives the truth.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.680
I can't make anyone get saved.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.680
And God doesn't hold me accountable

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.840
for making them get saved.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.320
He just holds me accountable for giving the truth.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.680
You understand that if you read your Bible this week

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.400
or if you don't read your Bible this week,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.760
it doesn't affect my spiritual walk with God.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.860
It doesn't.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.140
But I pray that you read your Bible.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.740
I encourage you to read your Bible.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.700
We preach about the importance of reading your Bible.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.540
Why?

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.220
Because the entrance of thy word giveth light.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.700
Because the word of God is quick and powerful

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.300
and sharper than the two-edged sword.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.660
Because the word of God is the word of God.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.620
It's given by inspiration of God and it is profitable.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.940
And therefore, it is good for you

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.660
just like it's good for me.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.820
And I pray that you pray.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.660
Why?

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.060
Because you need to walk with God

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.740
and you need to seek the face of God.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.260
I pray that you would know the will of God.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.820
To know the mind of Christ and to know the will of God

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.260
is to know this book.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.580
Amen?

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.700
I pray that God would keep you from the evil one.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.260
That God would help you to put on the whole armor of God

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.660
that you would be able to stand in the evil one.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:07.780
day and oh how we're living in an evil day amen and we need to pray one for

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.980
another when's the last time we've prayed for someone on this plane

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.740
spiritually that he's gonna go and he's gonna go and you're gonna go into a

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.020
world that you're gonna be bombarded by the devil by the enemy and we need the

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:32.260
armor of God but we pray on a physical plane someone's got a cold I'm not

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:38.180
trying to minimize a cold please understand what I'm saying we need to

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:45.660
get on the spiritual because it's a spiritual battle you know how Ephesians

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:51.900
turn over to Ephesians 6 because I want you to see how Paul ends under the

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.540
inspiration of Holy Spirit of God the passage dealing with the whole armor of

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:04.980
God we're to put on the whole armor of God but he says in verse number 18

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:13.100
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.860
thereunto with all perseverance and supplications what are the next three

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:24.580
words for all Saints can you pray for yourself with regard to the spiritual

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:31.220
battle yes and you should amen but you know what the admonition is who to pray

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:38.420
for all the Saints why because they're facing spiritual warfare and we get on

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:43.860
that plane of praying spiritually one for another and Paul says let me tell

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:50.140
you about a path for us he's one of you he's a servant of Jesus Christ he

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.660
saluted you he sends his greetings but he's praying always for you fervently

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:03.860
what that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God Wow if

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:11.540
someone tells me they're praying for me that way that encourages me amen because

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.380
if I know that our people are praying for me that I would stand complete in

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.580
all the will of God as I understand as Paul prayed in Colossians 1 that they

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.620
would be filled with the knowledge of God then when I enter into my time with

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.660
God and I'm seeking his face and I'm reading his word and God is teaching me

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.740
that's not only answering my prayers but that's answering your prayers because

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:39.860
you prayed that God would give me truth amen it's good for me to pray as I begin

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.700
my Bible reading as I did this morning Lord open how mine eyes that I may

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:50.020
behold wondrous things out of thy word speak Lord for thy servant heareth God

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:57.180
help me to understand your word and to do your word I pray that for myself but

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.620
we ought to be praying that for each other and then God works and somebody

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.340
says can I tell you I love it when this happens brother summer if you probably

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.140
have this happen the ministry too can I tell you I was reading my Bible and God

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.660
showed me something where do you get stuck I get stuck on I was in my Bible

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:20.620
it encourages me seriously you know you can read your Bible through in about 60

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.940
hours it's kind of a just you can just do the math and figure it out you can

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:35.380
get CDs and you can hear them it's about 60 hours statistics tell us I've never

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:40.860
been asked so I'll put that disclaimer you may not have been asked either but

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.100
statistics tell us that like less than half of the people that regularly go to

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:51.780
church have read the Bible through cover-to-cover this book is the mind of

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:58.620
God and as we pray one front of their spiritually that we would have that we

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.940
would stand complete perfect and complete and all the will of God and we

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.500
have this this desire that a path for us has and we say God give me that desire

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:15.020
for my fellow brethren for my brothers and sisters in Christ that I would

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:20.100
desire that they would grow spiritually that they would mature spiritually and

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:27.740
help me to not only desire that but help me to pray that way for them amen as I

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:38.620
look at a path for us I see a man who just humbly followed God I see a man

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:44.780
that's mentioned just three times Colossians 1 Colossians 4 and Philemon

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:54.140
his life was about Christ he had a a close walk with God it's revealed to us

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:58.660
through the ways in which he's described his devotion to God was

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:07.340
sincere was obvious it's exemplary but he had a desire his desire was not even

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:15.740
just for himself it was for his brethren and his desire was that they would they

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.700
would be perfect and complete and all the will of God we've had as our theme

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:28.180
all year complete in Christ from Colossians 2 in verse 10 that we'd

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:35.620
understand we are complete in him but that we would continue to grow not only

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.660
knowing the will of God but doing the will of God and this morning as we look

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:47.620
at these two verses of Scripture I really hope that first we'd be

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:58.780
encouraged by such a soldier of the cross amen his life encourages me his

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.300
life challenges me but but first I want to think about that encouragement oh we

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.980
should be encouraged by a man like a path for us I think he encouraged Paul I

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:13.380
believe that I believe that when Paul was there in Roman prison and a path

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.420
first came and brought him the news and as Paul observed his walk with God I

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:23.980
think Paul was encouraged and we too should be encouraged by a follower of

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:32.140
Jesus Christ man that desires God hungering and thirsting after

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:38.340
righteousness as the psalmist said in Psalm 42 is the heart panteth after the

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:46.500
water brooks so panteth my heart after thee Oh God someone made this statement

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.620
to me I was having a meeting actually last week and someone made this

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:58.660
statement to me and it was it was impactful it actually caused me to stop

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:04.300
right in our conversation and kind of rewind and let's talk about that the

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.700
statement that was made was this we ought to be jealous about our walk with

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:16.340
God and I thought man that's a good thought to be jealous about my walk with

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:24.140
God to have such desire and such passion to follow the Lord Jesus Christ that I'm

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:29.980
jealous I don't want anything to interfere with that and to understand

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.140
that that my walk with God is my walk with God and your walk with God is your

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:40.100
walk with God and to have that perspective with regard to our walk and

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:45.620
we see in a path first I don't think he was trying to impress Paul you know I

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.940
don't think that because I'm not God wouldn't put it in the word like he did

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:54.500
because you know what God knows the heart he knows the motive amen so if a

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.100
path first was just I'm gonna impress the Apostle Paul and I'm gonna show him

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.420
I know how to pray and this that and the other thing Oh God of our fathers

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:08.180
Abraham and Isaac no no no God would have included it in the word his walk

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:15.260
was sincere passionate we're encouraged by that but this morning I hope that

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:23.540
we'd be challenged by it and that we'd evaluate our own lives and say if just a

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.180
couple of verses I didn't count the number of words but if just that many

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:34.700
words were written about me from God what would he have to say about my life

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.820
we mentioned in Sunday school last week we mentioned again this morning how that

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:48.340
Jesus marveled at the faith of the centurion in Matthew 8 he says to those

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.100
that were there the disciples I've not found so great faith no not in all of

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:58.660
Israel there are other times in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ that he

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:06.740
marveled at their unbelief I would much rather God marvel at my faith than at my

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:16.060
unbelief amen how long will it be air you believe me and so this morning as we

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.380
are encouraged by the life and testimony of a paraphrase the zeal of this man I

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:29.860
hope that we also are challenged say Oh God help me to have that kind of devotion

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:39.900
help my walk with you to be sincere genuine help it to be obvious help me to

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:47.260
be a person a man a woman of prayer a child of prayer help me to serve you

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:53.100
faithfully and then that God would give us that spiritual desire one for another

00:39:53.260 --> 00:40:00.420
and then it would transform the way in which we pray because we're praying I'm

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.420
not suggesting we stop

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:07.300
worrying about physical needs, I'm just simply suggesting that we enter a new dimension,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:14.100
if you will, we get onto the spiritual plane, and understanding that we are to be in prayer

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:21.420
one for another, even as Epaphras was for those believers, and it's spiritual in nature,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:27.900
it's not temporal, it's not physical, it's spiritual, oh, that God would help us.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.620
Only two points this morning, because I have like six or seven tonight, try to balance

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.620
it out, amen?

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.620
Let's pray together.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:39.780
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for the testimony of this

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:51.740
man Epaphras, and as we look at these couple of verses of Scripture, my heart is encouraged.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:41:07.260
I thank you for his example, his walk with you, his devotion, I thank you for his desire,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.420
for his brothers and sisters in Christ, Lord, I pray this morning that you'd use your word

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:23.380
to challenge us, that we would truly evaluate our own walk with you, that we'd evaluate

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:33.500
our prayer lives, how is it that we're praying, are we praying fervently, are we praying faithfully,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:39.580
are we praying on this spiritual plane?

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:48.140
Lord, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only, help us to make some decisions

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:54.660
this morning that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ, that would cause us

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.100
to impact eternity.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:03.420
I pray that you'd move and work in the moments of our invitation as only you can.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:07.540
We'll give you the honor and the glory for every decision that is made, it's in Christ's

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.580
name we pray, would you stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed, we have this time

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.540
at the end of our services to give you an opportunity to respond.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.180
Maybe this morning you need to come to this old-fashioned altar and ask the Lord to help

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:26.740
you as you evaluate your own walk with God, to help you in your prayer life.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.540
Maybe this morning you just want to thank God for the opportunity to pray, the privilege

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.380
that is ours to serve Him.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.740
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you, I can know for

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.780
sure that heaven's your home.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:51.980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
