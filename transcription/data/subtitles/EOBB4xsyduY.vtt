WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
And as you're turning to Psalm 150, I will read for you the verse from the book of Titus

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.520
that we have gotten to in our study through the book of Titus, Titus 2 and verse number

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520
1.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.200
When Paul tells Titus, but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine, and we've

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.159
taken this purposed detour to deal with the subject matter of doctrine.

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.040
And some have asked, how long is it going to be?

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:32.439
The message I'm seeking to give you this evening, I could take seven weeks to deliver this message.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.840
And so I'm trying to make it through the doctrinal part, but I don't want to rush too much because

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.799
doctrine is important.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.360
And we're living in a time in which, as Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 4,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.080
that there will be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.959
And so doctrine is important.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:55.880
And so this evening, we will continue with our study on the doctrine of theology.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.040
And we started this section of our study on theology in the book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.919
chapter number 10, we used as our first lesson.

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:10.440
And verse number 6 says this, for as much as there is none like unto thee, O Lord, thou

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.000
art great and thy name is great in might.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.279
We looked at that verse as being sort of our template outline, if you will, for the study

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:21.720
of theology.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.279
And we're dealing still with that section of the verse when it says, thou art great.

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:33.440
And last week, we looked at the greatness of God, part one, and we studied the natural

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.000
attributes of God, the fact that our God is omniscient, He's omnipotent, He's omnipresent,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.639
He's immutable, and He's eternal.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:46.279
And how that ought to cause us to rejoice when we understand the way in which God has

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.919
revealed Himself to us in His Word.

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:53.199
This evening, we're going to continue looking at the attributes of God, we'll look at the

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:58.239
moral attributes of God, and with God's help, we'll try to look at seven of them this evening.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:04.040
It is not an exhaustive list, but it is a sampling that we'll have this evening.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.239
I want to draw your attention to verse number 2 of Psalm 150.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.839
We can read the entirety of the psalm and see the call to praise and how important it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.479
is that we praise the Lord.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:18.240
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says in verse number 2, praise Him for His

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.919
mighty acts.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:27.080
Now, we understand this evening that our God has done some incredible things, some marvelous,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.720
miraculous things that He's done, and we ought to praise Him for those things.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.600
And we praise Him for the things that God does, then we ought to, but then you look

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.759
at the latter part of the verse and it says, praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:48.800
Not only do we praise God for what He does, but we find that we praise God for who He

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.240
is.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.479
And I am thankful even as we look at the natural attributes of God last week and we dealt with

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.720
the fact that He's immutable, that He never changes, He is the same yesterday and today

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600
and forever, that this evening when we think about the latter part of Psalm 150 in verse

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.880
number 2, when the psalmist says, praise Him according to His excellent greatness, that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.559
our God is great, He never changes, and it ought to cause us to rejoice.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.639
There are times in our lives in which we deal with difficulties.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.919
There are times in our lives in which we go through what some have termed the valleys.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.199
We're in those valleys, our circumstances may not be great, but we understand that our

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.919
God is still great and He is still worthy of our praise.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:35.479
And so we need to understand who God is, and as we examine these attributes, it helps us

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.520
to understand who He is.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.320
This evening, if you're taking notes, it's just simply The Greatness of God, Part 2,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.279
and let me share the first attribute that we're going to look at this evening.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.320
This one, God is holy.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.800
God is holy, and the book of Isaiah, if you will, and we'll kind of be all over the place,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.080
I've not given, of course, an exhaustive list of verses for each of these points that we'll

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.240
deal with this evening, but I do want to show you the Word of God shows us that our God

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240
is holy.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.039
Isaiah chapter number 6, and the Bible says, beginning in verse number 1, and we're familiar

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:14.080
with this portion of Scripture as Isaiah's commission, if you will, and his call is recorded

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080
here.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.119
And the Bible says this, in the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:23.359
upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:27.079
Above it stood the seraphims, each one had six wings, with twain He covered His face,

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:31.079
and with twain He covered His feet, and with twain He did fly.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:37.760
And one cried unto another and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.920
earth is full of His glory.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.399
And the post of the door moved at the voice of Him that cried, and the house was filled

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.399
with smoke.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:51.359
We find that later on in the book of Isaiah, in chapter number 57, in verse number 15,

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:56.059
the Bible says this, for thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:02.040
name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place with Him also that is of a contrite

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.480
and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.320
contrite ones.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.600
We find that this, the dealing with the subject matter that is before us of this first attribute,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.040
the holiness of God, that our God is holy, it really is His most prominent attribute

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.000
that we find in the Word of God, and we find that it means to be perfectly pure.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.440
We find that it means to be complete in moral character.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.079
You understand that our God is not becoming holy, He is holy, and He will ever be.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:36.440
We find that the psalmist declares in Psalm 99, in verse number 9, exalt the Lord our

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.899
God and worship at His holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.839
And this evening, we think about the holiness of God, and we begin to understand as we review

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:56.440
the attributes of God, we begin to understand how He transcends us, and we begin to notice

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.239
the way that He would interact with us.

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:04.160
And this evening, we have to rejoice at the fact that we serve a God who is perfectly

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.160
holy.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.019
In fact, the psalmist, on more than one occasion, gives this admonition to the reader that we

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.799
are to give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:20.160
When we're mindful that our God is holy, it ought to cause us to rejoice.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.920
We find that we sang, actually this past Sunday morning, we sang, Holy, Holy, Holy.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.399
And what a great song it is to just pause and just reflect in the holiness of our God.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:36.720
We find that He is holy, He is perfectly holy, and He has called His people to live holy

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720
lives.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320
We find, the Bible says, that we're to be holy, why?

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.959
Because He is holy.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.559
And we see that, of course, first mentioned in the book of Leviticus, as He's dealing

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:51.760
with His people, and then again repeated in the New Testament for the people of God today.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:57.160
So we find that, really, the most prominent attribute of God with regard to His moral

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.880
character attributes is the fact that our God is holy.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.279
Notice number two, that God is righteous.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:09.040
We speak about the holiness of God, that God is perfectly pure, He's complete in moral

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.179
character.

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:14.160
We begin to deal with the subject matter of His righteousness.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.459
We would say this, that this is the expression of His holiness in dealing with mankind.

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:26.540
To say that God is righteous is to say that He is just and lawful.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.459
In other words, He always does that which is right.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:36.140
I'm so thankful that we serve a God that has revealed Himself to us in His precious Word,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.500
and we understand that He's holy, but then we understand that He's righteous.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.820
The psalmist says this, take your Bibles and turn to Psalm 145, if you will, and Psalm

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.179
145, and I want you to notice what the psalmist says with regard to the righteousness of God

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.820
and making this declaration.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.179
We examined part of this passage last week at the end of our message with dealing with

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:05.459
the fact of declaring the greatness of God, but I want you to notice in Psalm 145 in verse

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:15.940
number 17, the Bible says this, the Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.059
all His works.

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:20.940
We begin to think about the righteousness of God.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.540
Of course, we would understand as we think about the righteousness of God, we understand

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.220
what it is to be, as we would examine the character or attributes of some that are unrighteous,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.340
and we look at this attribute of our God and we say that He always does that which is right.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.340
Now, you understand that as we look at the attributes of God and we begin to examine

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.739
each of these attributes that we are simply just scratching the surface, but we understand

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:51.419
this evening that His attributes are in perfect harmony, one with the other, and as we begin

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:57.539
to understand this evening the righteousness of God, we understand that it's a pure working

00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:02.580
of God and the way in which He deals with mankind based upon His holiness.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.059
We can also understand it's an everlasting righteousness.

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:11.659
The psalmist says, and you can jot it down in Psalm 119 in verse number 142, the psalmist

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:20.059
declares, thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:24.340
When we begin to think about these first two attributes that we're dealing with this evening,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.700
the holiness of God and the righteousness of God, we find that we fall well short of the

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:36.380
word God omnipotent, that we find the scriptures speaking of mankind says that there are none

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:43.460
righteous, no not one, and we can begin to understand how that the attributes of God

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.940
as we begin to understand them and we say how can we approach God in understanding the

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.219
attributes that He's given us, revealing His character, His person to us, we thank God

00:09:55.219 --> 00:10:00.059
for the plan of redemption and how that Jesus Christ makes the way for us.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:05.719
us to have a relationship with the God of the universe.

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:10.379
And the Bible tells us, with regard to the subject matter of righteousness, in 2 Corinthians

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:15.579
chapter 5, that God hath made Him, Jesus, to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:19.339
might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:22.719
And so often, as we think about that verse of Scripture, we speak about the subject of

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:28.099
imputed righteousness, that Paul states that it's not in my own righteousness, but it's

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:32.299
in Christ's righteousness, and He is righteous.

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.459
And His righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:38.019
He is righteous in all His ways.

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:39.859
He always does that which is right.

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:42.379
It is to be just and to be lawful.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:45.139
Number three, this evening, God is faithful.

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:53.579
Oh, how we can rejoice, even thinking about the statement of the prophet Jeremiah in Lamentations

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:57.399
when he declares, great is thy faithfulness.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:02.839
We sing the song, and we consider the faithfulness of God, and we begin to think about, again,

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:08.899
as we've looked at these attributes, and the Bible tells us that God is faithful.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:13.399
And it's not that He sometimes is faithful, it's not that He's becoming faithful, no,

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:14.399
He's faithful.

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.959
What does it mean that God is faithful?

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:21.639
It means that He is constant, He is dependable, He is trustworthy.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.799
We understand what it is to have someone that is faithful.

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:29.519
We understand what it is to have someone that is unfaithful, that lacks faithfulness.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:33.720
And we understand this evening that our God is faithful.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.279
Again, as Jeremiah proclaimed, they are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness in

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:40.819
Lamentations 3 and verse number 25.

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:45.759
But I want you to notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter number 1.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:51.919
In 1 Corinthians chapter number 1, you know, the reality is that we serve a God who is

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.360
always trustworthy and always dependable.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360
Why?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360
Because He's faithful.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.479
I'm so thankful that He's shown us in His Word, He's revealed to us His character, that

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:04.720
our God is faithful.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.959
And here in 1 Corinthians chapter number 1 and verse number 9, notice what Paul says.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:13.039
God is faithful.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:18.720
By whom you were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.720
Here in 1 Thessalonians, he would say this in chapter number 5, faithful is he that calleth

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.239
you who also will do it.

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.959
And begin to think about the faithfulness of God.

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:35.599
If you've no doubt experienced times in life when you've dealt with someone that is a faithful

00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:41.319
servant, if you will, to use that terminology, or someone that is not faithful.

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:42.399
They're not trustworthy.

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.559
They're not dependable.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.559
They're not reliable.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.279
And we say when we think about our God and we understand how He's revealed Himself to

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:54.360
us in His Word, that He has declared to us that He is faithful.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.639
Now, as we begin to look at these, and we're just a few in this evening of these moral

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:05.279
attributes, I want you to just pause for a moment, and we'll mention again at the end

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:11.220
of the message tonight, but I want you to just pause and think about how the Bible reveals

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.940
to us the true nature and character of God.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.259
If you're going to try to determine who God is, if you're going to try to answer the question

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:22.660
of what is God like, you better go to the Bible.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.300
You better understand what the Word of God says.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.339
We find that too many today are looking for a definition of who God is from some other

00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:36.179
source, and there are many sources that are lined up that are ready to say, here's what

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:37.179
God is like.

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:43.619
And many times we find that they would seek to define God in terms that, I should say,

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:50.300
redefine God in terms that would be acceptable to them, that would perhaps accommodate the

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.080
way in which they want to live and appease their conscience.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.779
But we go to the Word of God and we find how God has revealed Himself to us and how we

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.779
ought to rejoice.

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:04.500
Our God is faithful.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.380
Not only is God faithful, number four.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.619
If you're taking notes, God is love.

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:12.979
Now I would submit to you this evening that we think about this particular attribute of

00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:19.459
God and declare that God is love, I would say this, that it's probably one of the most

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:23.859
discussed attributes of God in our society today.

00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:30.540
It's probably one of the most discussed attributes of God, but probably in the most erroneous

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.540
way.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.980
Why do I say that?

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:39.179
Because so many people run around today declaring this term, God is love.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.779
That's biblical, by the way.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:45.940
The Word of God declares for us in 1 John 4, in verse number eight, he that loveth not

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.279
knoweth not God, for God is love.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:54.619
We find that in verse number 16 of that same text of Scripture that again, John will declare

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:57.339
that same statement, God is love.

00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:02.540
And so we find that when they would use this statement, when they would say, well, God

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:08.459
is love, we have to take a step back and say, well, what do they mean by that?

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:13.739
Because it's not biblically erroneous to say that God is love, for we know that God is

00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:14.739
love.

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:16.220
But what does God reveal to us?

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.100
What does that mean that God is love?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:24.500
I've often shared over the years about one of the dangers of false teaching is that they

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.859
will use our vocabulary, but not our definitions.

00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:32.660
In fact, I was speaking with someone yesterday and shared that very truth with them.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.440
And I said, we have to be so careful because at times we'll hear people use a word, a phrase,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.679
a Bible term that we use and we understand what we mean by it, but they mean something

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:50.299
entirely different because they're using the vocabulary, but they're using a different definition.

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:54.700
And it's absolutely essential for us as the people of God when somebody says something

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.059
and we say, well, what do you mean by that?

00:15:57.059 --> 00:16:02.380
That's going to go lengthy ways to find out what they are meaning by the statement that

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.859
they're making.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:07.940
And this evening, we find that the Word of God declares the love of God.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:15.279
One of the most known verses in all of the Bible, John 3.16, for God so loved the world.

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:18.880
We understand that many people know that verse of scripture.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.820
Many children have memorized that verse of scripture.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.739
In fact, when some missionaries come home and they try to share Bible memorization in

00:16:27.739 --> 00:16:32.500
another language, sometimes it's John 3.16 that they go to to share that verse and they'll

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.940
teach kids in children's church.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.000
And what a precious verse it is.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.119
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:43.419
in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:48.739
And what a blessing to know that God has declared His love in His Word.

00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:51.919
Not only has He declared it, He's demonstrated it.

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:55.980
But God commendeth His love toward us, and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.619
for us in Romans 5 and verse number 8.

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:05.019
And what a blessing to understand that His love has been declared and His love has been

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:06.019
demonstrated.

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:11.779
But when we begin to think about how is His love defined, you've heard me say this before,

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:18.260
but it's worth repeating, I believe that God's love is best defined as being protective,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.419
not permissive.

00:17:20.419 --> 00:17:25.980
So often today in the society in which we live, if you hear those that are trumping

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:32.380
or banging that drum that God is love, what they're meaning by that is God is permissive,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.579
that God is okay with my lifestyle, that God is okay.

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:38.779
He wants me to be happy.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:40.859
God is love.

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.980
And that's just not true.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:49.980
The reality is that God's love is best described as being protective, not being permissive.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.980
We understand that in a number of different arenas of life.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.980
We understand that probably one of the best illustrations of understanding the protective

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:07.220
nature of love versus the permissive nature of love is that of the love of a parent for

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.820
their child.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.859
Of course, we understand that our children at times want to do something that they are

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:20.859
not permitted to do, and perhaps they have a desire to do that something, and we understand

00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:27.820
as parents that are older and wiser that that something could cause great harm to them.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.820
And they want to do it.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.820
They throw a fit.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.099
They desire to do this thing.

00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:38.340
But because we love our children, we will protect them from that thing versus permitting

00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:39.859
them to do it.

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:45.619
Well, Johnny wanted to put his fork in the outlet, and so I let him do it because I love

00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:49.299
him, and I just thought he just really wanted to do it.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.419
That's not going to fly.

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:52.659
We protect them, right?

00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:59.059
So think about the nature of God and understand this evening that he loves us with an everlasting

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:00.059
love.

00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:03.700
We find that Romans in chapter 8 teaches us that there's nothing that can separate us

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.299
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, and how we can rejoice in that truth

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:09.419
this evening.

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:13.580
But when we understand tonight that God is love, we say that God loves me so much that

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.539
he wants to protect me, that he wants to protect you.

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:22.179
It's not a permissive, yeah, just go do whatever you want to do and live however you want to

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.140
live because God is going to accept you because God is love.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.440
No, it's protective, not permissive.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.840
We find that our God is holy, he's righteous, he's faithful, he's love.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.260
Notice with me that our God is compassionate.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.520
Our God is compassionate.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.179
Look over in Psalm 86, if you will, Psalm 86 and verse number 15.

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:50.719
In fact, if you want to jot down the entirety of Psalm 86, it'd be a great chapter for you

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:57.400
to go and read and just to understand just the way in which David is praying and seeking

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.320
the face of God, many of God's attributes.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.800
are mentioned throughout this passage of Scripture. A heart attitude of humility is displayed on the

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.880
part of David to be taught the way of the Lord. We find in Psalm 86 and verse number 15, the Bible

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:21.760
says this, but thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, long-suffering, and

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.880
plenteous in mercy and truth. We see a number of other attributes in this verse of Scripture that

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.440
are given beyond the fact that our God is compassionate, but I want you to take note of

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:38.160
the fact that the Bible says that our God, that He is a God that is full of compassion. The word

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.880
compassion is an interesting word. They tell us it's a mixed passion. It's a compound of love and

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.840
sorrow. We think about the Word of God and how God's Word reveals to us that our God is compassionate,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.080
that He is full of compassion, and we rejoice in that truth, but we find that on many occasions,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.960
especially if you study the life of Christ and the Gospel records, you will find that there is

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.600
this expression in the Scriptures that is used regularly, that Christ was moved with compassion.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.840
We have a God that is full of compassion. We have a God who is moved with compassion.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.600
We find that in the book of Matthew, notice what the Bible says during, again, one of the examples

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.160
of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ here in Matthew chapter number 14,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.960
and I want you to notice what is taking place here and to see the compassion of our Lord.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.120
We see here that the Bible tells us about Jesus and, of course, the things that are going on

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.120
specifically in His ministry, and we're going to jump right in the middle of the text, but in

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:51.120
Matthew 14 and verse number 14, the Bible says this, and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude

00:21:51.920 --> 00:22:01.360
and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed their sick. He was moved with compassion,

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.040
and then what did He do? He healed those that were sick, and what a blessing, and we begin to see how

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.760
that even as the evening would draw on and all these are going on, that you enter right into the

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.400
text of Scripture that records for us the miracle, the feeding of the 5,000 when the disciples say,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.760
hey, send them away, but Jesus, He was compassionate toward them, and He wanted to meet that need,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.640
and here we see that He was moved with compassion. It's a great study to go through the Scriptures

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.320
of the gospel records and to see all the times in which our Savior was moved with compassion.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.240
We speak today in our society, there are some that speak about we need to be more compassionate,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.080
and certainly we find that our God is compassionate, and He's full of compassion,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.440
and He's moved with compassion. If you're taking notes, number six, I know we're moving quickly.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.520
Again, we could preach a whole message on each of these, and I just want to kind of scratch the

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.640
surface this evening and maybe whet your appetite for some further study of these attributes.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:07.760
Number six, God is gracious. He is gracious. So often we speak about the grace of God,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:15.920
and we sing about the grace of God. One of the probably most often requested songs, Amazing Grace,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:23.280
and we understand Brother Don, he just makes me laugh every time we get anywhere near the 180s in

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.600
the hymnal, he wants to know why we're not on 187, because that's Amazing Grace, and it's as if the

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.840
other eight songs there just, you know, not just, you know, we got to be 187, and What a Blessing,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.560
Amazing Grace is a great song. We speak about God's abundant grace, and we begin to think

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:48.880
about God's grace, and notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 111 with regard to this attribute

00:23:48.880 --> 00:24:00.080
of God's grace. In Psalm 111, we find that in verse number four, the Bible says,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:10.000
he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.880
Once again, we see that compassion referenced here in this verse of Scripture. We're focusing

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.119
here on that attribute that the Lord is gracious. This evening, we find that really the grace of

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:27.920
God can be defined as God giving us what we do not deserve. Some have said that grace is

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:34.960
God's riches at Christ's expense, and what a great definition, if you will, of the subject

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.520
matter of grace, and thinking about grace, certainly it is the grace of God in giving

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.119
us what we do not deserve, thinking most importantly about that salvation. And you

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:50.800
think about saving grace, and we find that the apostle Paul is writing to the believers in the

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.360
city of Ephesus in the book of Ephesians, and notice in Ephesians chapter 2, in verses 8 and 9,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.160
Paul is speaking, and again, a passage of Scripture that we've often quoted,

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:10.880
but just allow it to sink in this evening. The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:18.000
faith, because our God is gracious, because He gives us what we do not deserve, because

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.240
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, went to that cruel cross, He was crucified,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.040
He was buried in a borrowed tomb, and He rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.640
We find that it's by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.040
the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. We think about the grace of God,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.520
and we think about the fact that our God is gracious, we are mindful this evening of saving

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:48.240
grace, and oh, how we ought to rejoice for the grace of God. We find the Word of God also speaks

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:55.600
about serving grace, and that is God giving us the ability to serve Him and His empowering.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.399
We find that in the book of 2 Corinthians, in chapter number 12, if you flip over there and

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:09.200
notice what Paul says with regard to the grace of God here, specifically dealing with that serving

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:17.920
grace, and we find here that Paul is speaking about the grace of God and how we ought to rejoice

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:25.279
in understanding that our God is gracious, and His grace has been given to us, and he says that

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:31.679
He wants to be a good steward of the grace of God, and I've jotted down the wrong passage of

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:37.360
Scripture here, and it's not 2 Corinthians 12, verse number 7. Let's see here. Yeah, let's look.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.880
It says, "'And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation,

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.920
there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.640
be exalted above measure for this thing, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.'

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.520
And here's the answer of God. The Lord said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.040
My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.080
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities,

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.279
and reproaches, and necessities, and persecutions, and distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:18.720
weak, then I am strong." We begin to think about the grace of God, and God's grace is sufficient

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.000
for us, and we certainly are thankful for that. The verse that I was thinking of in my mind as we

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.640
were turning there is in 1 Corinthians 15. If you want to jot that down, 1 Corinthians 15,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.839
in verse number 10, I want to read to you what Paul says there. He says this in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:39.679
in verse number 10, "'But by the grace of God, I am what I am.'" And notice what he says,

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:45.040
"'And His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:53.119
they all. Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.'" And we find that we have been given

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:58.080
the grace of God, His serving grace, the opportunity that He's given us to serve Him.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.520
And what a blessing it is to serve the Lord and to understand that it's by His enabling,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.800
and that's when we speak about the grace of God, not only saving grace, but serving grace.

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:14.160
And finally, this evening, as we finish up these attributes, I want you to notice that God is

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:22.240
merciful. God is merciful. And what a blessing to think about the grace and mercy of God. We often

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.559
speak of them in connection one with the other, and really there's just a small nuance and

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:32.960
difference between the two attributes. If we say that grace is God giving us what we do not

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.880
deserve, we would say this of mercy, that mercy is God not giving us what we deserve.

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:45.760
And really, they're, again, very closely associated one with the other. The psalmist

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:53.520
declares you were in Psalm 114 and Psalm 116. And verse number 5, I want you to notice,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.520
and we've already read a couple of verses that have referenced the mercy of God,

00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:03.919
but I want you to notice here again the grace and righteousness and mercy of our God is mentioned

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:08.640
all in one verse of Scripture. Here in Psalm 116 and verse number 5, the Bible says,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:18.559
Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful. We find that over in the verse that

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:24.160
we read a moment ago in Psalm 86 and verse number 5, that the psalmist tells us that our God is

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:32.000
plenteous in mercy. We find that this phrase is found 41 times in the Scriptures. The phrase is

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.640
this, that His mercy endureth forever. You read about that throughout the Psalms. And again,

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.960
on 41 different times in the Scriptures, you read with regard to the mercy of God that His mercy

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:54.160
endureth forever. Paul says, speaking of the mercy of God in Ephesians 2 and verse number 4,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.919
but God who is rich in mercy for His great love wherewith

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:01.759
He loved us.

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:05.059
We think about that word rich, it means abounding.

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:08.139
And He says that our God is rich in mercy.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:11.519
Again, the psalmist says that He's plenteous in mercy.

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.399
Our God is merciful.

00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:16.319
He doesn't give us what we deserve.

00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:21.159
We come to God through the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:23.199
and we find that our God,

00:30:23.199 --> 00:30:25.359
He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:30:25.359 --> 00:30:28.079
Why? Because He's gracious and He's merciful and He's faithful

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:30.979
and we read all of those things and we understand that.

00:30:30.979 --> 00:30:34.359
And so this evening, as we look at these seven attributes

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:38.119
of God, and we've gone through them quickly this evening,

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:40.919
and we've dealt with the fact that He is holy,

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:44.159
He's righteous, He's faithful, He's love.

00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:46.239
We find that He's compassionate,

00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:49.039
He's gracious, and He's merciful.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:51.039
We say, man, that's a lot.

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.259
There's so many more attributes

00:30:52.259 --> 00:30:53.599
that we could deal with this evening,

00:30:53.599 --> 00:30:55.939
but just to look at those seven tonight,

00:30:55.939 --> 00:30:57.719
and how does it impact us?

00:30:57.719 --> 00:30:59.399
How does it affect us?

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:02.319
Well, number one, it ought to cause us to rejoice.

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:04.519
It ought to cause us to rejoice tonight

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:07.959
that we serve a God that is so great

00:31:07.959 --> 00:31:11.319
and He has revealed to us His character.

00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:14.079
He's given to us His attributes and His word

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:16.259
so that we'd understand who He is.

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:18.539
As we examine His character,

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:20.899
as we examine the attributes of God

00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:22.799
that are revealed to us here,

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:25.319
it causes us to rejoice greatly.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:28.359
Remember, we started this evening in Psalm 150

00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:31.919
when the psalmist said, praise Him for His mighty acts,

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.939
praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:37.039
You wake up tomorrow morning

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:39.279
and God is still going to be holy.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.999
He's still going to be righteous.

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.079
He's still going to be,

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:44.319
go right through all of them

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.479
that we've dealt with this evening.

00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:49.319
He's going to be omnipotent and omniscient

00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:50.599
as we dealt with last week.

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:54.239
Our God is always going to be those things

00:31:54.239 --> 00:31:56.519
because we find that He's faithful.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:57.919
He is immutable.

00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:00.799
And this evening as we are mindful of those truths

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:03.039
that it helps us to understand

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:05.699
and to rejoice greatly in who He is,

00:32:05.699 --> 00:32:08.759
it helps us to declare His greatness to another generation,

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:10.399
to another group of people.

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:11.799
They don't know who our God is.

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.319
They don't know that He's faithful.

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.919
They don't know that He's gracious and He's merciful.

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:19.039
There are people today in our society

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:22.719
that have all sorts of weird views about God.

00:32:22.719 --> 00:32:24.399
And yet we have the Bible

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:27.639
and we've been given truth about who our God is.

00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:30.159
And for those of us that have accepted Christ as our Savior,

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:33.719
we have the privilege of Him being our God.

00:32:34.639 --> 00:32:38.399
As we mentioned in closing last week in Psalm 48,

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.559
the Bible speaks about the greatness of God

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.279
and it speaks about great is the Lord

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:43.559
and greatly to be praised.

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:46.239
And the Psalm ends in verse number 14

00:32:46.239 --> 00:32:50.879
when it says, this God is our God forever and ever.

00:32:50.879 --> 00:32:55.879
He will be our guide even unto death.

00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:59.119
We think about the greatness of God.

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:02.799
And I wonder this evening how His greatness,

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:04.559
not only does it cause us to rejoice,

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:08.319
but how does it impact us on a daily basis?

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:11.639
How is it that when we understand the attributes of God,

00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:15.199
how does that impact how I live my life day by day?

00:33:15.199 --> 00:33:18.159
How does it impact how I deal with the troubles and trials

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.819
and difficulties in my life

00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:22.979
when I'm mindful of the fact that my God is,

00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:26.659
and we're listing out all of these attributes of what He is,

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:30.539
then it enables me to approach those times of difficulty

00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:34.099
and adversity with a completely different approach

00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:36.259
because I'm mindful of who my God is

00:33:36.259 --> 00:33:39.819
and I'm mindful of who He has revealed Himself to be

00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:42.459
and that He is my God.

00:33:42.459 --> 00:33:44.859
I think about some in the scriptures that we read of.

00:33:44.859 --> 00:33:47.199
In fact, many that we read of in the scriptures

00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:49.019
that really as we think about the way

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:53.659
in which they approach God and they approach Him properly

00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:56.299
and the basis for their approach to God

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:58.019
is understanding His attributes,

00:33:58.019 --> 00:33:59.619
understanding His greatness,

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:01.899
understanding what He's able to do.

00:34:01.899 --> 00:34:03.339
You think about the disciples.

00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:04.899
We could use a whole host of illustrations.

00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:06.219
I'll use one this evening.

00:34:06.219 --> 00:34:09.739
You think about the disciples as they begin to pray

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.959
and they're being threatened and they've already had some,

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:15.739
some of them have been imprisoned for a short period of time

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.099
and they've dealt with some persecution at various levels.

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.419
They've been threatened and beaten

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:23.779
and yet we find they go and they pray

00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:25.879
and they begin to pray that God would work

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.699
in very distinct ways.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.539
Why?

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:29.899
Because they understand who God is.

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:31.459
They understand that He's omnipotent.

00:34:31.459 --> 00:34:33.039
They understand that He is the creator,

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:34.619
that He has all the power.

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:37.379
They understand that He's aware of where they are

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.859
and what they're dealing with

00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:42.339
and we could look at a whole host of examples this evening

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:44.419
as to the attributes of our God

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:47.499
and how it impacts the people of God.

00:34:47.499 --> 00:34:50.039
How we go to God and we understand

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:53.259
that He is ready to pardon, He's forgiving.

00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:55.779
Aren't you thankful for that this evening?

00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:59.019
And it causes us on the basis of understanding His grace

00:34:59.019 --> 00:35:00.579
and His mercy and His love,

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:03.899
it helps me day by day to be able to have

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:08.899
that proper approach to who God is in my daily life.

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:13.979
And this evening, we serve the God of the universe

00:35:13.979 --> 00:35:16.379
and our God is a great God.

00:35:16.379 --> 00:35:20.059
And He is the only God, we understand that.

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:22.579
But to think about His greatness,

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:25.739
I hope this evening, I'm sure that none of these things

00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:27.939
are new to any of us.

00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:30.579
When we think about the context in which they're given

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:33.139
and we think about the subject matter that's before us,

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:34.819
I say, thank you, thank you, Lord,

00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:37.539
for revealing your person to us.

00:35:38.499 --> 00:35:39.899
A whole lot of people in this world

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:41.619
that have no idea who God is.

00:35:42.499 --> 00:35:44.939
We find there are a whole host of other people today

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:47.899
in this world that are seeking to make God

00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:51.619
something that He is not, someone that He is not.

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:54.979
And we find that the book of Romans deals with that

00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:57.819
in very particular when the Bible speaks about the fact,

00:35:57.819 --> 00:35:59.979
professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

00:35:59.979 --> 00:36:02.939
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image

00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:05.059
made like to corruptible man and to birds

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:06.819
and four-footed beasts and creeping things,

00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:09.379
Romans 1, 22 and 23.

00:36:09.379 --> 00:36:11.059
We see that happening.

00:36:11.299 --> 00:36:12.859
We find that there's a group of people

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:15.539
that simply don't wanna be accountable

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:18.219
to the God of the Bible, the God of the universe.

00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:20.379
But I believe this evening that there's a number of people

00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:22.499
that just simply don't know, they've been deceived,

00:36:22.499 --> 00:36:24.899
they've been blinded by the God,

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:26.899
little g of this world, Satan.

00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:29.819
And we have the privilege of saying,

00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:32.619
but this is the God of the Bible.

00:36:32.619 --> 00:36:34.019
Did you know that God was?

00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:36.619
And we begin to speak His attributes, what a blessing.

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:38.499
I'm so thankful for the word of God this evening.

00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:40.259
I hope it's been a blessing and encouragement to you

00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:42.219
and that we rejoice greatly,

00:36:42.219 --> 00:36:43.979
not only for the things that He does,

00:36:43.979 --> 00:36:46.899
oh, how we ought to praise Him for what He does,

00:36:46.899 --> 00:36:49.059
but that we praise Him for who He is.

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:50.219
Father, we love you this evening.

00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:51.299
We thank you for loving us.

00:36:51.299 --> 00:36:52.939
Thank you for the word of God.

00:36:52.939 --> 00:36:54.179
Thank you for these attributes.

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:55.899
I know that we've gone quickly this evening,

00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:57.859
but Lord, I pray that you'd help each one of us

00:36:57.859 --> 00:37:02.059
to be encouraged tonight at the thought of your greatness

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:05.139
and Lord, that we would rejoice greatly.

00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:08.579
Help us, Lord, to declare your greatness.

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:09.499
Bless our time of prayer.

00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:11.699
We do thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:14.819
We thank you that you're a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:16.979
I pray that you'd bless the remainder of our time

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:19.459
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:21.099
Does anyone need a prayer bullet?
