00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
or 12 this evening, Genesis chapter number 12.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.320
You'll be looking at verses one through nine this evening.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.519
You notice in verse number four,

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.520
as you're turning there in Genesis 12 and verse number four,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.239
the verse begins with these three words.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.880
So Abram departed,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.360
and that's the title for the message this evening.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.799
So Abram departed.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:22.840
I mentioned this in our last study

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.040
in the latter part of Genesis chapter number 11,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000
that at times I may refer to Abram as Abraham

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.040
and please forgive me,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.400
I know that his name is not changed yet,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.680
but so often we refer to him as Abraham,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.319
and so if I slip, you'll understand why.

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:39.799
And we see here throughout the text of scripture

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.880
that his name at this particular time is still Abram.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.759
As we have previously discussed,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.400
in fact, in our very last lesson

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.080
at the end of chapter number 11,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.200
we mentioned how the lens of scripture

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.439
has now focused upon Abram and his descendants,

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.439
the Hebrew people, the nation of Israel,

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.319
as we often refer to them as.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.840
And we find that as we entered

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.799
into the latter part of Genesis chapter 11,

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.199
once again, there in the middle section

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.599
of Genesis chapter 11,

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.160
God gave us another record of the descendants of Shem

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.400
to show us the lineage to Abram.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.680
And we find that as you enter into the last section

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.080
in verses 27 down through verse number 32

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.919
of Genesis chapter 11,

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:24.120
that God gives us an introduction to Abram

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.000
and he describes the departure

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
from the Ur of the Chaldees to Haran.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.360
We understand that he left the land of his nativity

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.080
according to verse number 28.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.599
The land of his nativity was the Ur of the Chaldees

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.559
and we find that it was there

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:40.519
at the mouth of the Euphrates River.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.440
And at the end of chapter number 11,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.239
we find that they're still there in Haran.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.080
In fact, at the end of verse number 31,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.319
it says, and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.760
And we went through and studied this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.040
in our last message on Sunday evening a couple of weeks ago

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.559
with regard to that subject matter.

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:01.760
In the first section of Genesis chapter number 12,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.000
as we look at these first nine verses,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.440
we are now provided with the record of the journey

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.720
from Haran to Canaan.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.119
And we find here that the word of God begins

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.119
in verse number one.

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.880
If you're taking notes this evening,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.720
number one, the instruction received.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.520
The instruction received,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.639
and really we find this in verse number one.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm so thankful that our God would provide us

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360
with direction, with instruction.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720
We understand the word of God is profitable.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.919
2 Timothy 3 and verse number 16

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.399
speaks about the fact that God's word is profitable

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.360
for doctrine, for instruction, right?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800
We see reproof and so on and so forth is listed there,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.720
but we understand that God's word

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.360
contains instruction for God's people.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.639
At this particular time,

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.479
Abram did not have a Bible like we have a Bible.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.160
And so therefore the Lord spoke to him.

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.160
And you notice the Bible begins in verse number one.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.119
It says, now the Lord,

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.679
now just stop there just for a moment

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.000
and consider that the Lord God of the universe,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.360
the Lord God almighty,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.160
that he is going to speak

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.559
and he's going to give instruction.

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.199
This instruction will be received by Abram.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:15.080
And we find that here it says had said unto Abram.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.399
Had said, we understand that this would indicate

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.559
that God had given Abram some direction

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.600
when he was back in the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.160
In fact, as you begin to study scripture

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.639
and compare scripture with scripture,

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.080
in our last study, we referenced Acts 7,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.240
verses one through four.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.600
And you'll find there in that text of scripture

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.160
as Stephen is preaching

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.520
that he references about the call of God to Abram.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.720
And in the text of scripture in verse number two,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.240
Stephen says this, and he said,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.559
men, brethren and fathers hearken.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.600
The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.880
when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.399
and said unto him, get thee out of thy country

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.759
and from thy kindred and come into the land,

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.520
which I will show thee.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.800
And so we find here that the Lord is speaking to Abram,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.479
that he's giving this direction,

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.960
this instruction to this man.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.080
And it says that he had said again,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.119
if you go back to the latter part of Genesis chapter 11,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.320
this instruction has been given.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000
It is now further repeated because he had been in Haran.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.200
Now understand that Haran

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.239
was not the final destination for Abraham.

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:31.720
This was not the place in which he was to dwell

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.760
and the land in which God said that he would give them.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.440
As we mentioned, as you understand the landscape

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.920
of the region of the world there that they're in,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.600
you would find that as they were

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.279
at the mouth of the Euphrates,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.399
they went Northwest and really kind of followed the path

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.359
of the Euphrates River until they came to Haran.

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:54.480
And then they would now travel in chapter number 12,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.640
Southwest and eventually come to the land of Canaan,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.959
the place in which God would show him.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.079
Notice the Bible says, get thee out of thy country

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.640
and from thy kindred and from thy father's house

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.880
unto a land that I will show thee.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.799
We understand again that this instruction

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:16.160
has been provided and as God is giving this instruction,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.000
it is important that Abraham would understand

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.279
that it was time to leave Haran.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.839
He was not to dwell there any longer.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.559
We dealt with last week some of the reasons

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.320
in which they may have stopped at Haran.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.880
We understand, the Bible tells us

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.160
the end of verse number 32, that it was there

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.640
that his father Terah died.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.519
And so we don't know exactly all of the specifics

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:44.640
that were going on with regard to the health of Terah

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.799
as they arrived to Haran and if perhaps

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:49.959
that was part of the reason for stopping there

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.359
and dwelling there for that period of time.

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:55.720
But then when Terah died, the Lord reminds Abraham

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.880
that this is not his final place,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.239
that it's time to continue on his journey

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:02.959
and the instruction is given.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.640
I'm so thankful that God provides that instruction

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.859
and that it has been received.

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:10.779
Notice with me as we continue through the passage,

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.899
in verses two and three, we see the promises rehearsed.

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:18.019
The instruction received, the promises rehearsed.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.420
It's important that we note here

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.619
in these two verses of Scripture,

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:25.820
the phrase, I will, I will.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.500
God is giving Abraham some promises

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.019
that we often would refer to as unconditional promises.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.500
There are, we find within the Word of God,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.459
there are unconditional promises

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.820
and then there are some promises

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.779
that are conditional promises.

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.059
Typically, the conditional promises of Scripture

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.859
are promises that we would describe

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:48.540
as being if-then promises.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.420
In other words, God says, if you do this,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.100
then I will do this.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.779
That's a conditional promise.

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.660
In fact, if you were to study the first half

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.179
of Proverbs chapter number two and you go through

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.500
those verses of Scripture in Proverbs chapter number two,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.540
you see multiple if-then, if-then, if-then.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.359
What's God saying?

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.440
I'm not gonna do these things,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.600
but it's based upon you doing these things.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
Here we find that God says to Abram, I will.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.519
The promises are rehearsed.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.279
The promises that Almighty God would make.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.119
We mentioned this morning from Hebrews chapter number 10

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.160
how that we are to have no wavering.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.000
Why?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.040
Because we understand that our God,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.079
the one who has promised that He is faithful.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.040
And what a blessing that is.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.019
We've often referred to the Abrahamic covenant earlier.

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:39.720
In our study in the book of Genesis,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.079
we dealt with the Noahic covenant.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.679
And as we dealt with the Noahic covenant,

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:46.480
we mentioned several of the aspects of that covenant.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.799
And here we find in verses two and three,

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:52.320
several aspects with regard to the Abrahamic covenant.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.760
Notice what he says in verse number two.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.880
And I will make of thee a great nation.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.040
I will make of thee a great nation.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:06.839
We find that God is giving this promise to Abram

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.760
and he tells them he's gonna make them a great nation,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.160
the Hebrew people, the people of Israel.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.040
You understand that during the time,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.820
during the reign of David and Solomon,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.480
that the nation of Israel had possessed

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.799
such vast levels of territory and they were so powerful

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:29.200
in the prominence that they had in the world

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.880
at that particular time.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.280
But we also understand prophetically

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.320
many things about the Abrahamic covenant.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.280
We'll get into some of those things this evening

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.280
even as we get into verse number three.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.739
But we find here that prophetically speaking

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.479
that the Lord Jesus Christ will rule and reign

00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:50.679
for a thousand years during the millennial reign of Christ.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:54.239
And what a blessing it is for us to understand that

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:57.799
and to see how that even here in the beginning portions

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:00.039
of this 12th chapter of the book of Genesis

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.679
is begin to see these promises that are rehearsed,

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.479
how that we understand, yes, there was some fulfillment

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:09.239
of this during the time of Israel as a nation

00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:10.719
historically we can read of,

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:13.719
but then when you have prophecy in view

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:17.119
and you understand the millennial reign of Christ,

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:19.359
notice he continues in verse number two,

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.479
not only will I make of thee a great nation,

00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:23.880
notice he says, and I will bless thee

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880
and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing.

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:31.719
Isn't that wonderful?

00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:34.520
We see a little bit as we end verse number two

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.840
and then get into verse number three,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.539
how that blessing is going to work

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:39.479
at the end of verse number three,

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.479
it says, and in thee shall all families of the earth

00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:43.640
be blessed and we'll touch on that in just a moment.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.679
But notice in verse number two that he says,

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.719
I will bless thee and make thy name great

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.039
and thou shalt be a blessing.

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:52.440
I want you to think about this and kind of break it up.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.840
Notice if you hold your hand here

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.119
and turn over to Genesis chapter 24.

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:58.599
And in Genesis chapter number 24,

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.520
we find that the servants.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:07.320
of Abraham. Abraham is stricken in age and Eleazar most likely is the servant

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.920
that was going to be given this task. It's the eldest servant of his house

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.020
according to verse number two. And the task was to go and find a bride for

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.840
Isaac. And it's interesting as this servant would go, and we'll study chapter

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.240
number 24 in I don't know how many months by the time we get there, but we

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.280
eventually will get there to chapter number 24 in our study of the book of

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.240
Genesis. But we find that the servant of Abraham says this in verse number 35.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:44.360
Notice where he says, and the Lord hath blessed my master greatly. What did God

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:52.000
say in verse number two? I will bless thee. And the servant, Eleazar most likely, is

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.520
the one that is here speaking. He says in verse 34, I am Abraham's servant. And he

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.040
says that the Lord hath blessed my master greatly, and he has become great.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.720
And he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.440
maidservants, and camels, and asses. And you see how that God blessed Abraham. And

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.360
his servant recognizes that it's the Lord that had blessed his master. You

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.440
know this evening as a side note, it is important for us to recognize the

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.760
blessing of the Lord in our lives. Far too often people, especially in the

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.280
culture in which we live, there's this idea in this thought in which we're

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.840
self-made people. The reality is that God's hand of blessing has been upon us.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.840
We begin to consider the blessing of God and begin to consider the things that we

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:52.960
have. We say, well I worked hard for that. Who gave you the ability to work? Amen.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.760
And if we ever come to the place where we forget the blessing of God, we're in a

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.320
very dangerous place. The children of Israel were warned in Deuteronomy

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.440
chapter number 6 when he said, beware lest thou forget the Lord. When you enter

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.480
into a land and you possess homes that you did not build, and you partake

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.360
of the vineyards that you did not plant, and so on and so forth, beware lest thou

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.280
forget the Lord. And there are times in which we find in Israel's history that

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.440
they were guilty of that very thing. They forgot the source of blessing and

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.640
how important it is that we recognize the source of blessing and the servant.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.600
He does not say, he does not come in. Now, I want you to understand this. I believe

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.720
it's significant. I'll deal with this again in several months. Most of you will

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.200
forget what I said now. I might forget what I said now, so we'll be able to

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.480
repeat it. Amen. But the reality is that the servant has a perspective that no

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.720
doubt Abraham contributed to that perspective, right? Abraham did not

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.960
portray to his servant, look at me, look at what I've done, look at what I have,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.320
look at all of my possessions. No, no, I believe that Abraham was careful to let

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.800
his servant understand, God has blessed me. And that's important for us to

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.680
understand because it is the blessing of God. Often, I understand as we would

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.120
think about maybe our roles and responsibilities and as a husband and

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.280
father, oftentimes we think of our responsibility to provide for our family

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.560
and certainly that is a responsibility that we have, but I regularly remind our

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:39.400
children that yes, God has been so good to us and he has provided for us and he's

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.960
given us the opportunity to have these things. God's hand a blessing upon us. We

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.640
see it in the the life of Abraham. We see here this promise that God makes to

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.000
Abram and we find that he says, I will bless thee, and he did. He said, I'll make

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.160
thy name great. You know, Abraham is still the patriarch for the Jewish people.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.480
Father Abraham. Many of the Jewish people will refer to Abraham in that manner. In

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.000
fact, many, not only Jewish descendants, but many Islamic descendants will also

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.680
hold Abraham in high regard. They have a misunderstanding, from my perspective,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.040
biblically speaking, as to the role of Ishmael versus Isaac and so on and so

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.520
forth, and we'll get to that in a few months as we continue through the book

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.440
of Genesis, but we find there's a grave misunderstanding there with regard to

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.280
the blessing and the descendant and so on and so forth, but many of them will

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.040
also refer to Father Abraham. Abraham's held in high regard. He said, I will bless

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.160
thee and I will make thy name great. We spoke often, even as we looked at the

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.240
book of Hebrews, how that so many things in which the writer will present and

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.560
show how that Christ is superior, and you'll remember that even during the

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.280
life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, that there were times in which

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.720
the people would say, well, we're the disciples of Moses, and we find that they

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.720
would make statements such as that, and we find that there was some discussion

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:12.040
in John chapter number 8 with regard to Abraham and so on and so forth, and

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.760
Jesus is speaking there and speaking to them about Abraham, and he says, your

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.960
father Abraham, in verse number 56 of John 8, your father Abraham rejoiced

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.200
to see my day, and he saw it and was glad. And of course, those Jews, they had no

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.280
understanding. They said to him, thou art not yet 50 years old. They can still say

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.080
that about me for a little while, amen? And hast thou seen Abraham? And what did

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:46.240
Jesus say? Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am. We find that

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.520
Abraham was held, is continued to be held in high regard. God said, I will bless

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.560
thee. He said that I will make thy name great. He says, thou shalt be a blessing.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.160
We're gonna hold that thought as we go into verse number 3. Notice in verse

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160
number 3, as it continues, the first aspect of verse number 3, he says this,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:13.160
and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. You know,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.680
the reality is that this aspect of this promise, we could find not only in

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.720
biblical history, but in modern history as well, many examples of this truth

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.280
right here. Those that are the friends, the allies of the nation of Israel,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.320
historically, biblically speaking, they have been blessed, and those that are the

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.120
adversaries, they have been cursed. You can see it. You can look at biblical

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.760
history, you can look at the modern history, you can see it throughout this

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.320
case of what God is saying here. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.400
that curseth thee. By the way, it's a good thing for us to be friends of

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.160
Israel, amen? And it's important for us to understand that truth, even as

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.400
we find here in Genesis 12, in verse number 3. Notice he continues and ends

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.400
this level of the promises being rehearsed. In verse number 3, it says,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:14.560
and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. And in thee shall all

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.320
families of the earth be blessed. He said at the end of verse number 2, and thou

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.280
shalt be a blessing. Notice, if you turn over to Genesis chapter 22, in verse

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.600
number 18, we'll be mindful of the fact that Genesis 22 records for us the time

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.320
in which the Lord gave instruction to Abraham to offer Isaac, his son, upon the

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.840
altar. And we find that in Genesis 22, in verse number 18, notice what God says, and

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:43.000
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.080
obeyed my voice. Now, we understand this truth in Genesis, and it's important that

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.880
we follow it through, and go over to the book of Galatians, if you will, in the

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.960
third chapter. I mentioned to you this morning that we would reference this

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.240
passage of Scripture this evening. In Galatians chapter number

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.360
3, really, if you're taking notes, write down verses 6 through 18, because you

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.680
need to read all of it, and you need to reference all of it. This evening, I won't

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.320
have time to read all of it, I'm just gonna pick some verses out of it and

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.960
give you the truth that is here, but it's such a rich passage of Scripture that

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.000
provides us with great truth with regard to how all the families of the earth

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.320
would be blessed. Remember, as we looked at Hebrews chapter number 6 many weeks

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.960
ago, and referenced it this morning, we said that more of the promise, the aspect

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.880
of the promise that was in view in Hebrews chapter number 6, was the

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.920
promise of a seed, not so much the promise of a land. And we find here that

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.600
that seed is mentioned here in Galatians 3. Notice in verse number 6,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.780
even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, know

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.000
you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.720
Abraham. In the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.600
faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, notice what it says,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.480
and thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.080
blessed with faithful Abraham. But how is that? How did this promise that was given,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.080
how would that come to pass? Skip down and look at verse number 15, verse

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.400
number 14, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through who?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:32.280
Through Jesus Christ. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.800
through faith. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men, though it be but a

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.760
man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth thereunto,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:48.600
or thereto. Now to Abraham and his, what does it say? Seed. Were the promises made,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:20:01.239
he saith not, and to seeds as of many, but as one. And to thy seed, which is Christ.

00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:05.239
And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God and Christ,

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:08.159
the law which was four hundred and thirty years after,

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:11.659
cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:15.039
For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise,

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:19.079
but God gave it to Abraham by promise."

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:23.459
And it's so important that we understand the truth that is being given here,

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:25.759
as God would be giving these promises,

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.459
and these promises are rehearsed here in Genesis 12, verses 2 and 3,

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:32.019
and he says, "...and these shall all families of the earth be blessed."

00:20:32.019 --> 00:20:34.599
And we study and compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:38.719
and we find that here, the seed that is being spoken of,

00:20:38.719 --> 00:20:42.479
the blessing that would come is through Jesus Christ.

00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:46.819
Thus, the reason that the lens of Scripture focuses in,

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:50.659
at the end of Genesis chapter number 11, upon Abram.

00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:53.499
And we find that beginning here in chapter number 12,

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:57.319
and going forward, we see how that Abraham and the people of Israel

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.099
become the central focus of Scripture.

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:02.859
Yes, there are other people, groups, and other nations

00:21:02.859 --> 00:21:04.859
that are dealt with throughout Scripture,

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:10.119
but primarily as they interacted with the people of God.

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:13.279
We find that what he's saying here at the end of verse number 3,

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.779
when he says, "...and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed,"

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:19.499
is he's speaking about our Savior who would come.

00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:22.659
Remember the Messianic line, the Semitic line,

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:27.079
and that's why it was important that we trace in chapter number 10,

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:31.459
the descendants of Shem, and how it goes to Terah and then Abram.

00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:35.179
And we see that line in the fulfillment of the promise

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:39.299
in which Noah made back in chapter number 9,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.259
when he talked about the blessing of the God of Shem.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:49.899
And you begin to look at Scripture and see how everything fits together,

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:53.559
and how God has given us these wonderful truths.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:57.299
We see in the first few verses that the instruction is received,

00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:59.339
the promises are rehearsed.

00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:05.519
In verses 4-9, we see Abram's obedience is recorded.

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:07.899
It's only three words to begin verse number 4,

00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:11.779
and it's the title by which we're using for our study this evening,

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:16.079
but I want you to think about the significance of these three words.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:19.579
So, Abram departed.

00:22:19.579 --> 00:22:21.159
He obeyed the Lord.

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:23.599
Aren't you thankful that he departed?

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:27.479
Aren't you thankful as you begin to understand all that we've just dealt with,

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:32.599
and you begin to understand all of the implications of those simple three words,

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:38.019
that simple action that Abram took in obeying the voice of the Lord?

00:22:38.019 --> 00:22:39.479
So, Abram departed.

00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:43.239
We understand that as we look at that phraseology,

00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:45.699
that it would be faith and obedience.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:49.359
And it says here that Abram departed, notice this,

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:54.039
as the Lord had spoken unto him.

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.079
He was obedient to the Lord.

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:59.199
You'll never go wrong obeying God.

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:00.739
Amen?

00:23:00.739 --> 00:23:04.459
God will never lead you in a wrong way.

00:23:04.459 --> 00:23:07.539
We ought to be careful that we're following the Lord's direction.

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:08.299
Amen?

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:12.679
We ought to be absolutely assured that we're following the Lord's direction,

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:16.799
that we're not just looking at it from some temporal human perspective

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:20.239
of how we make decisions on what we're going to do and so on and so forth,

00:23:20.239 --> 00:23:23.919
but know that we're following the direction that God has given us in our lives.

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:28.039
And we find here that Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:30.299
Notice as we look here, the Bible says this,

00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:34.139
and Lot went with him, and Abram was seventy and five years old

00:23:34.139 --> 00:23:37.599
when he departed out of Haran.

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:39.759
It tells us in verse number five,

00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:44.319
and Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son,

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:46.879
and all their substance that they had gathered,

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:49.559
and the souls that they had gotten in Haran,

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:52.639
and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.639
And it says at the end of verse number five,

00:23:54.639 --> 00:23:59.099
and into the land of Canaan they came.

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:02.319
They left Haran, we see at the end of verse number four,

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:06.559
it says that they departed out of Haran at the end of verse number six,

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:11.519
and they came, and into the land of Canaan they came.

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:14.159
And God gave them the provision for the journey that they needed.

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:18.160
We see that Abram took his wife, Sarai, he took his nephew, Lot,

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.279
they took all of their substance, according to what we read in verse number five,

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:24.880
the servants that they've been able to gather, and so on and so forth.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.599
And we find that they took that journey,

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:32.880
and God, no doubt, went before them and provided along the way.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.559
What a blessing.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:38.319
You know, I think about Abram, and I think about his faith,

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:45.679
and his obedience, and how God said to go unto a land that I will show thee.

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:47.599
It was just simple obedience and faith,

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:51.119
following the direction of the Lord, trusting God.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:55.199
We read in verse six how the Bible would review for us

00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:57.199
the places in which they came,

00:24:57.199 --> 00:25:01.119
and we see in verse number eight, again, the references that are provided.

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:02.000
It says in verse six,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.039
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem,

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:08.880
under the plain of Morah, and the Canaanite was then in the land.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.839
And so we see that they come first to this place

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:14.880
that often referred to as Shechem throughout the scriptures,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.359
and it says under the plain of Morah.

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:20.239
It does reveal to us at the end of verse number six

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:22.399
that the Canaanite was then in the land.

00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:26.479
We're familiar with the truth that we mentioned back in chapter number nine

00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:28.160
with regard to the Canaanites,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.679
and we had referenced during that particular message

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:33.359
and dealing with that subject matter,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.359
how the Canaanites would initially inhabit the land

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:40.079
that we would refer to as the land of promise.

00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:42.319
Of course, the Canaanites would be in that land

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.000
for a lengthy period of time,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.839
hundreds of years that they would be in that place.

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:50.239
And we find that they go to Shechem,

00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:51.359
they come to the plain of Morah.

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:54.799
Notice in verse number seven what significance this holds.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.639
Again, the Bible says,

00:25:56.639 --> 00:26:00.160
and the Lord appeared unto Abram.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.599
Isn't that exciting?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.799
Can you imagine?

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:06.559
As Abram was following the leadership of God,

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:11.599
as Abraham was obedient to follow the direction that had been received,

00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:15.519
we find that the Bible tells us that the Lord appeared unto him.

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:16.959
And notice what he says,

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:21.759
unto thy seed will I give this land.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.839
It says, and there built he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:30.880
I want you to think about the significance

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:34.880
of the appearance when God appeared to Abram

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:37.919
and how wonderful that must have been.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.559
I want you to think about the significance

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:43.279
of what the Lord said to Abram when He said,

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:47.519
unto thy seed will I give this land.

00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:50.799
This has been something that has been debated for centuries

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.639
with regard to the ownership of the land.

00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:56.399
And we understand that God not only made this promise here to Abram,

00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:59.039
but we find that the promise would be oft repeated

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:02.479
throughout the Pentateuch and even into the book of Joshua.

00:27:02.479 --> 00:27:04.000
And as you continue through the Scriptures,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.720
you begin to understand this promise that has been given to Abram

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.399
and to his descendants, to his seed.

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:11.839
He says, well, I give this land.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:15.119
Notice how Abram responded.

00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:17.759
We see how that Abram worshiped the Lord.

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.199
Isn't that a natural response, by the way?

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:27.839
The Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto Abram,

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:30.479
unto thy seed will I give this land.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:33.679
And the Bible tells us that in that place,

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:38.799
Abram built an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:41.279
The purpose of building an altar is to worship.

00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:42.339
Amen.

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:46.319
And we find that Abram was a man that often would build an altar.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:48.720
In fact, in verse number eight, we'll read again

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.039
how he built an altar unto the Lord.

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.959
And we can begin to understand

00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:55.440
the way in which he would worship the Lord.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.519
And by the way, this evening,

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:00.399
we understand that our God is worthy of our worship.

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:03.279
He alone is to be worshiped.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.160
Amen.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.639
And we find here that it says in verse number eight,

00:28:06.639 --> 00:28:10.000
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.319
and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.

00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:17.440
And so we find that as he begins to travel

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.239
and remove from that place in which he found himself there

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.239
in Shechem in the plain of Morah,

00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:23.440
according to verse number six,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.000
that they're going to continue to travel.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.720
And the Bible tells us that now he comes to this place

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.239
where he has Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.

00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:36.880
And the Bible tells us there that he built an altar unto the Lord.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.239
And notice this phrase and the significance of this phrase,

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:46.080
and called upon the name of the Lord.

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:49.599
See, often we begin to see throughout the scriptures

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:53.039
how that the people of God would worship the Lord

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:56.159
and how that he is worthy of our worship.

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:59.679
And what a blessing it is for us to understand

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.839
how that Abraham, as he's here in Genesis chapter number 12,

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:06.000
as he's received this instruction,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.119
as he's heard the promises rehearsed,

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:13.599
and we now have the opportunity to see the record of his obedience.

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:17.760
And as we read of the record of his obedience,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.479
we are told here that Abraham

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:24.159
not only had gone into the place where God told him to go,

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.640
but we find that he's worshiping the Lord.

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:31.279
John 4 talks about the truth that they that worship him

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:34.719
must worship him in spirit and in truth.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:37.520
It's interesting at the end of the book of Matthew,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.039
if you turn over there, if you will, to Matthew chapter number 28.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:45.839
And I want you to see after the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:49.760
And we understand that they went there early to the tomb.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.159
Remember, they found it empty because he had risen from the dead, as he said.

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.959
And what a glorious morning that was.

00:29:56.959 --> 00:30:00.640
But we come to Matthew chapter 28 and verse number 17.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:07.640
And when they saw Him, they worshiped Him.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.640
Today, our God is worthy of worship.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.640
They that worship Him, to repeat what I said a moment ago from John 4,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.640
they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.640
By the way, not all that is called worship is worship.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.640
God defines what worship is. Amen?

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.640
And we're to worship God on His terms, not on man's terms.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.640
And we find that the Scriptures are full of truth

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.640
with regard to how we as the people of God are to worship the Lord.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640
We see there at the end of verse number 8

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.640
that not only did Abraham build another altar unto the Lord,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.640
but he called upon the name of the Lord.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.640
Again, often as we study through the life of Abraham

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.640
over these next several chapters,

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.640
you'll have the opportunity to see the faith and obedience of Abraham

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.640
and to see his worship of God and what a blessing that is.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.640
We find as we conclude in verse number 9,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.640
and we'll get into the latter part of Genesis 12 next Sunday evening,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640
but I want you to see that the Bible says,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.640
And Abram journeyed going on still toward the south.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.640
I want you to consider as Abram would journey

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.640
and as the Scriptures tell us that he continued on still toward the south,

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:29.640
that Abram had the opportunity to see this land that God had promised to his seed.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.640
We find that as they would journey and as they would travel,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.640
they have this group of people.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.640
And we know that at this particular time that Abram and Sarai,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.640
they have no children, they've not yet had Isaac.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.640
We know that there in chapter number 11 and verse number 30,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.640
the Bible told us that Sarai was barren and she had no child.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.640
The significance of that truth and the importance of understanding

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.640
the promise that God would give with regard to a seed,

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.640
and even as we read it here in Genesis chapter number 12,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.640
and we go through the next several chapters

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.640
and we see how that God would provide and bless and what He would do.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.640
And Abram is now at the place where God has directed him to go.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.640
We find that even in that place there would be trouble.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.640
The very next verse of Scripture tells us that there was a famine in the land.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.640
It will be the subject matter in which we discuss next Sunday evening

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.640
in understanding what happens.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.640
I want you to realize this evening that Abram,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.640
though there are many things that we can look at in the life of Abram

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.640
and we can look at as being exemplary and certainly noteworthy,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.640
that he is not a perfect man.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.640
Only the Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect example.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.640
But no doubt as we begin to look at the life of Abram

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.640
and see this text of Scripture in Genesis chapter number 12,

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.640
how we ought to be impacted as we think about

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.640
and consider the faith and obedience of this man.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640
Notice what the writer of Hebrews says.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640
Turn to Hebrews 11 if you will,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.640
and we'll conclude with this passage of Scripture this evening

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.640
in Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.640
I want you to notice what the Word of God says.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.640
In verse number 8 of Hebrews 11, the Bible says,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.640
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.640
which he should after receive for an inheritance,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640
what's it say?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640
Obeyed.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.640
And he went out not knowing whither he went.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.640
He didn't know exactly where he was going.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640
He was just following God. Amen?

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
He got to Haran.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.640
Haran wasn't the final destination.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.640
That was a place in which they dwelt

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.640
and it was a place in which they stayed for a period of time.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.640
But when Terah died, God said this isn't the final place.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.640
You need to continue journeying.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.640
And we find the Bible says that he obeyed

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.640
and that he went out not knowing whither he went.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.640
By faith, notice verse number 9 of Hebrews 11,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.640
he sojourned in the land of promise.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.640
I think we see that a little bit in verse number 9

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.640
in Genesis 12 where he continued traveling

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.640
still towards the south.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.640
He sojourned in the land of promise

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.640
as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.640
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.640
of the same promise.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.640
You think about how the lens of Scripture

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.640
looks down future speaking of Isaac and Jacob

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.640
and how that would come to pass

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.640
and they would live in that land.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.640
For he looked for a city which hath foundations,

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.640
whose builder and maker is God.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.640
There are more things that are said

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.640
about Abraham and Sarah here in the passage of Scripture

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.640
in Hebrews 11, but I want you to just notice

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.640
and consider this evening the faith and obedience.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.640
So Abram departed.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.640
See, when the Lord speaks in this evening,

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.640
we know that he's given us a perfect book,

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.640
a complete canon of Scripture.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.640
Sixty-six books.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.640
Precious Bible.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.640
It's profitable.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.640
And God speaks to us through His Word.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640
Amen?

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.640
God gives us direction in His Word.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.640
He provides us with the direction that we need.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.640
And it is vital that we as the people of God,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.640
that we simply trust Him,

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.640
that in faith and obedience we respond

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.640
to the voice of God.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.640
Abraham had a different experience than we did

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.640
in the fact that the Lord appeared to him

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.640
and spoke to him audibly,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.640
but we have the written Word of God.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.640
What a joy to be able to go to the Word of God

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.640
and feast upon what thus saith the Lord.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.640
And we can go to the Scriptures

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.640
every day of our lives and receive the direction

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640
that God has for us.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.640
The question is what do we do with it?

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.640
So Abram departed.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.640
He heard the direction of God.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.640
He heard the instruction and received it.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.640
And he responded in obedience.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.640
And what a blessing.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.640
See, this morning we made note of the way

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.640
in which God has made a new and living way,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.640
the access that is available,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.640
and how silly it would be for us to know

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.640
that we have access,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.640
but yet decide not to enter in.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.640
Right?

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640
Let us draw near.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.640
Since we have access, we draw near.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.640
And so Abram receives the direction,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.640
the instruction from God Almighty.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.640
How silly to not obey.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.640
But we say the same things to ourselves this evening.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.640
God gives us direction.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.640
God gives us instruction.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.640
And yet we find that there's this constant struggle

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.640
that we have as human beings

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.640
to simply trust Him,

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.640
to simply obey Him and follow Him.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.640
We have so many influences in our lives

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.640
and so many things that are going on

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.640
and swirling around

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.640
that at times we struggle with the simple truth

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.640
of simply trusting,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640
just taking God at His word.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.640
I'm so thankful this evening that Abram departed.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.640
I'm thankful this evening that we have the opportunity

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.640
to read of these promises,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.640
often we refer to as the Abrahamic Covenant,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.640
and begin to see how the lens of Scripture

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.640
will focus upon Abram and his descendants,

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.640
of course leading us to Messiah Himself.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.640
I'm so thankful for the blessings

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.640
that we have received

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640
and that we, as we look at Galatians 3,

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.640
that we have received that promise,

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.640
that blessing,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.640
through who? Through Jesus Christ.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.640
And this evening, if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.640
as we see in Galatians 3,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.640
He says this truth,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640
and I don't want to misquote it,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.640
so let me just turn there real quick.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.640
In Galatians 3, you don't need to turn there,

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.640
but He says that,

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.640
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.640
the same are the children of Abraham.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.640
I'm not a child of Abraham

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.640
because of my lineage bloodline being Jewish,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.640
but I am part of that being a child of Abraham

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.640
through faith, which are of faith.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.640
And what a blessing to understand

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.640
that seed that was promised. Amen?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.640
So Abram departed.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.640
Oh, that God would help us obey Him.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.640
We love You. We thank You for loving us.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.640
We thank You for the opportunity

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.640
to have Your Word.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.640
Thank You for giving us the complete canon of Scripture

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.640
and for the opportunity this evening

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.640
to see how that Your servant, Abraham,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.640
how he obeyed You.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640
Thank You for the promises that You gave him.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.640
Thank You for how You blessed him.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.640
I thank You for his perspective

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.640
of his blessing, understanding

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.640
that God, it was Your hand of blessing upon him.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.640
We see that even through the testimony of his servant

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.640
when he mentions about how the Lord

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.640
hath greatly blessed His Master.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.640
God, this evening I believe that

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.640
each of us could stand and testify

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.640
of Your goodness in our lives.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.640
I pray that we'd never be in a place,

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.640
a position of being deceived

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.640
and thinking that somehow

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.640
we have gotten these things

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.640
or added these things to ourselves.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.640
But God, that we would be mindful

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640
of Your good hand of blessing.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.640
Father, I pray

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.640
that as we have rejoiced

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.640
to see the obedience and faith of Abraham,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.640
how that he departed and followed,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.640
that we would be challenged this evening

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.640
to be obedient to Thy Word.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.640
That God, we would simply trust You.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.640
That we would rest in You.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.640
That You would give us that peace

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.640
that passeth all understanding

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.640
as we trust You and follow You.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.640
I pray God that You would use us

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.640
in our community, in our society.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.640
I pray, Father, that You would be

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.640
glorified in our lives.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.640
Help us to worship You as we should.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.640
We see how that Abraham,

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.640
how he built these altars

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.640
and he worshipped and he called

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.640
upon the name of the Lord.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:08.960
God, help us to see you in all of your glory, high, holy, and lifted up.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.080
As we read of the disciples there in Matthew 28, that they saw him and they worshipped

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.080
him.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.840
God, help us to worship you as we should, in spirit and in truth.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.840
I pray that you would guide and direct during this time of invitation if there's one that's

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:30.520
not sure of heaven, they've never received the gift of God, which is eternal life through

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.880
Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.000
They've not yet received that promise that's been mentioned in Galatians 3, and they've

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.520
not received that promise from Genesis 12 on how all the families of the earth would

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.240
be blessed through the seed through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:51.800
I pray that this evening they would understand that they're a sinner in need of a savior,

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.400
that Jesus Christ is the only savior, that he came to seek and to save that which was

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400
lost.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.560
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.360
of judgment to come.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:08.360
They would not leave this place nor log off of the live stream without knowing for sure

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.080
that heaven is their home.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.360
I pray that you'd work as only you can and we'll give you the glory for all that you'll

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360
do.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.360
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:16.860
Would you stand with me?
