WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.559
on Thursday and they did not have a microphone and they said I'm sorry we

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.199
don't have a microphone here and it's like it's not really necessary it's okay

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:17.360
and at the end someone commented of you have a voice for a clergy individual I'm

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.479
not sure what to call you but whatever it is that we're supposed to call you

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:26.100
you have a voice for it and I wasn't sure exactly how to take that but I said

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.639
thank you and praise the Lord and we certainly thank the Lord for the

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:34.759
opportunity I mentioned to some on Friday evening about the opportunity at

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.639
that funeral and there are a number of lost people that were there in fact I'm

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.040
pretty confident that most everyone that was there was probably lost and had the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.560
opportunity to give the gospel a couple of different times and so very thankful

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.400
for that opportunity and we're trusting God to do what only God can do as the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.959
the seed has been planted amen and so thank you for your prayers Deuteronomy

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:59.220
chapter number six this evening Deuteronomy chapter number six and we'll

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.839
be looking specifically at the end of the chapter verses 20 through 25 but by

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.940
way of introduction we're mindful this evening that the book of Deuteronomy is

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.879
a unique book as it provides vital instruction to the children of Israel as

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.980
they were prepared to enter into the land of promise we understand that the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.239
Lord ensured that his people would understand what it was that he expected

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:29.180
of them and we find that God would give Moses the instruction of course that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.300
had already been given but now would be given again here in the book of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.319
Deuteronomy and we find that as God would give this information to his

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.419
people and Moses is a faithful minister to deliver this information it was for

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:48.779
their good and I'm so thankful and I know that I mention it often but I'm so

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:55.839
thankful to have a Bible that God and his infinite wisdom determined that he

00:01:55.839 --> 00:02:01.559
would give us his word and it's through his word that we have an opportunity not

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:06.279
only to learn who he is and who we are but we have the opportunity to

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:12.080
understand through the scripture through the Word of God what it is that pleases

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.639
God and what it is that displeases God it teaches us how we can approach a holy

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:23.220
God and I'm thankful for the Word of God and we find that here for the children

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.699
of Israel as they would prepare to enter into a land that they had not yet been

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:33.240
to but a land that had been promised to them by God Almighty of course he had

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.380
made it known to them prior and then through this book he reminds them that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.460
they're not to behave in the manners in which they saw the Egyptians behave nor

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.679
were they to behave in the manners in which they would see the people that

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:54.820
dwelled in the land they were not to behave in that manner either that God

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.059
was going to prescribe for them that behavior that would please him and here

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.539
in Deuteronomy chapter number six really this particular chapter is so rich with

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:14.220
just amazing treasures if you will and I want to focus on verses 20 through 25

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.460
for the message this evening but really go home and read the entirety of this

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.820
chapter there's many many truths here that would be a blessing to you but the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.139
Bible says this in verse number 20 and when thy son asketh thee in time to come

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:37.259
saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:45.419
Lord our God hath commanded you then thou shalt say unto my son we were

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.539
Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:56.860
hand and the Lord showed signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt upon

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.580
Pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes and he brought us out

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.500
from fence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swear unto our

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.540
fathers and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.100
God notice this phrase for our good always that he might preserve us alive

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.820
as it is at this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.420
all these commandments before the Lord our God as he hath commanded us you'll

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.260
notice not part of our specific text this evening but in verse number 18 the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.500
Bible says and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.459
Lord notice this phrase that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:57.220
in and possess the good land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers and so we

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.660
notice in verse number 18 that the Word of God says that it may be well with

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.380
thee here in verse number 24 the phrase that we've used for our title this

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:14.660
evening for our good always God gave these statutes and it's our duty to obey

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.339
these statutes and it's for our good always we find that as we look at this

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.500
portion of Scripture I want you to notice first of all the inquiry notice

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.220
the inquiry it's made in verse number 20 and as these this passage of Scripture

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.779
would begin to unfold and share this truth with with us this evening we find

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:41.859
that the Bible says when thy son asketh thee in time to come and so we notice

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:46.459
the inquiry that is being made we understand that here as God is giving

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:51.140
this truth and he's preparing his people for entrance into the land and earlier

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.940
in this passage of Scripture we find that the fathers were given the

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.059
responsibility of teaching their children and giving them truth as they

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:04.579
would have that responsibility we find that God warned them that when they

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:08.980
would enter into a land that had houses which they built not and vineyards which

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.579
they planted not and when they were enjoying all of the good of the land

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:17.500
that they must beware lest thou forget the Lord and now as we come to the end

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.260
of chapter number six God is giving the children of Israel he says and when thy

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.779
son asketh thee in time to come he does not say if thy son but he says when thy

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.579
son the reality is that we notice as we look at this particular passage and

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:38.660
think about this inquiry that is being made we'd find that it's a reasonable

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.140
inquiry we find that many times our children we can experience how that even

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.540
our children may ask us questions about the things that we do about the manners

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.299
and behaviors that we have and they may look to us and say why do we do these

00:06:54.299 --> 00:07:01.899
things and we find that here God says to the the children of Israel he says when

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:10.019
thy son asketh thee in time to come notice the question what mean the

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:18.899
testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:25.339
commanded you we note at the end of the question that there was a recognition

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:31.619
there was an understanding that they came from the Lord our God but we find

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:37.579
that they're inquiring as to what mean the testimonies the statutes and the

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.619
judgments we find that testimonies as we look at these three categories that are

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:47.619
mentioned specifically in verse number 20 that testimonies are laws as divine

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:52.019
testimonies we would find that as you would look to the Pentateuch as we'd

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:57.500
often refer to it as the the first five books of the Bible and we begin to look

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.820
at Leviticus and Exodus and look at those books and understand that God is

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.619
giving the law many times we would think about the law and we may think strictly

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:11.859
to Exodus 20 with the Ten Commandments but you understand that the law for the

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:17.019
people of God was much more detailed than just Ten Commandments we find that

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:21.779
there were many testimonies many laws that had been given to the children of

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.619
Israel and as you would study through the book of Leviticus and you'd study

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:30.940
through that portion of scripture will be begin to read of the laws that God

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:37.219
gave the testimonies that God gave not only did God give testimonies but we see

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:42.900
the second mention here in verse number 20 is with regard to statutes a statute

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.619
is an ordinance or a prescribed task there were certain things that the

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:53.539
children of Israel were instructed to do to observe things that they were to keep

00:08:53.539 --> 00:09:00.140
as an ordinance and these prescribed tasks would be categorized as being

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:06.619
statutes and then we'd find finally in verse number 20 that the third of these

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:13.340
categories is that of judgments a judgment is an act of deciding a case a

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:19.140
process or procedure for a decision we understand that if we'd read through the

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.219
law and we'd understand the entirety of it there were certain ways in which you

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:29.460
could break the law and it would give what the judgment should be and you'd

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.859
find that those judgments were prescribed there were certain ways in

00:09:32.859 --> 00:09:39.419
which you could be found guilty and the judgment for such behavior was death and

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:44.340
you can read of these things in the book of Exodus and the book of Leviticus in

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.659
particular and you can read of all of these testimonies and statutes and

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:55.580
judgments and you find that the generation to come is going to to come

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.340
and they're going to make this inquiry and they say what mean

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.980
the testimonies and the statutes

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.840
and the judgments which the Lord our God

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.000
hath commanded you.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.300
Why? What is the purpose of these things?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.720
What is it? Why is it that God has given

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.660
these to us?

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.360
I made note just a moment ago

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.160
that this is, I believe,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.260
a reasonable inquiry.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.420
And I believe that when we recognize

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.640
that it's a reasonable inquiry,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.280
that it will result in a unique opportunity.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.680
I believe that at times,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.200
and perhaps it was here that God

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.660
was giving this truth to His people

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.900
so that they would avoid the danger

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.920
that far too often I think

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.240
that we're guilty of falling into,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.200
and that is looking at an individual

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.680
that would question as being a rebel.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.200
Someone is questioning why we do these things

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.400
that they're just standing in opposition

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.780
and rebellion to whatever it is

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.200
that's been taught or that's been going forth.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.560
But we find that God is saying to His people,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.520
there's going to come a time

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.340
when your children are going to ask.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.400
Be prepared to give an answer.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.220
Don't just take it as being rebellion.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.320
Don't just take it as they're just

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.180
bucking the system, so to speak.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.100
Be prepared to give an answer.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.500
Maybe the reasonable inquiry

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.620
will result in a unique opportunity.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.000
Can you imagine?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.860
As we would put ourselves

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.900
in the position of the children of Israel,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.220
and perhaps as being a parent

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.700
to one of these children that come and say,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.740
why is it that God gave these testimonies

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.020
and these statutes and these judgments?

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.700
Run along, child. He just did.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.500
It's just our duty to do.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.180
What's going to happen to that child?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.380
You think there's going to be any relationship

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.780
that's going to be developed there?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.820
No, you've missed the opportunity.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.620
We find that this inquiry

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.220
leads to a unique opportunity.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.080
I believe that as we would think about

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.740
the instruction that is given here

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.080
to the children of Israel,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.120
and even as we think about our own lives,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.260
that we must purpose to seize the opportunities

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.140
such as this one to instruct

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.740
and influence a future generation.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.300
The opportunity that we have

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.940
to seize that moment

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.060
and to understand in that moment

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.460
that when that inquiry is being made,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.420
that it is an opportunity for us

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.020
to influence and instruct a future generation.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.820
Let me explain to you.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.900
Let me help you understand

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.860
why God gave us that which He has given us.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.300
And as we would begin to look at the answer

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.660
that is provided,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.660
and God is such a good God.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.940
He says, here's how you answer.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.820
Let me help you get the right answer.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.540
Here's how you answer your children.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.300
When they come with this question,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.620
when they come and they say,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.620
what mean the testimonies, the statutes,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.580
and the judgments which the Lord our God

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.780
hath commanded you,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.980
then thou shalt say unto thy son.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.100
God gives them the answer.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.700
Here's what you need to tell your children.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.860
Here's how you influence and instruct your children.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.980
And so we notice the inquiry.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.900
Now notice the instruction.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.740
We notice this inquiry is made,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.900
but we find that the instruction is so deep

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.940
in v. 21-25,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.380
and we would find the depth of the answer

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.780
in which God gives to His people

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.540
to provide for the next generation.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.060
He says, here's what you tell them.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.980
We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.940
And the Lord brought us out of Egypt

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.180
with a mighty hand.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.060
I believe that as we look here at v. 21,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.020
and then notice in v. 22,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.540
it says, and the Lord showed signs and wonders

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.940
great and sore upon Egypt,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.460
upon Pharaoh,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.260
and upon all his household.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.780
Notice this phrase,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.500
before our eyes.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.340
The reality is that there are some things

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.620
that you have seen.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.180
There are some things that the parents

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.700
observed and experienced

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.900
that the children have not experienced.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.460
And so we find that in v. 21 and 22,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.660
that when we note the instruction

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.340
that what they would be giving

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.140
to the generation to come,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.300
to their children,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.900
is they would declare to them

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.700
the might and power of God.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.500
That God brought us out of Egypt

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.180
with a mighty hand.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.340
Now, I understand that it stops there

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.460
in v. 21 and says God brought us out,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.220
but you understand as you would be

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.460
the individual again to put ourselves

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.900
in this position of crossing that Red Sea.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.500
You think that the conversation

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.540
could go further than just simply saying

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.980
He brought us out with a mighty hand?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.780
You begin to dive in as to how God did it.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.860
What God did.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.500
What you experienced.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.740
And you find that you begin to declare

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.220
to a generation to come,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.940
to your own children in this particular context,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.380
the might and power of God.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.660
He says in v. 22 about the way

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.860
that the Lord showed signs and wonders

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.580
great and sore upon Egypt.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.940
What is He speaking of?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.620
He's speaking of the plagues, no doubt.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.540
You begin to understand those nine plagues

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.020
and then of course the tenth

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.580
with the death of the firstborn.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.940
And you begin to understand

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.500
that it says at the end of v. 22,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.180
before our eyes.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.660
They experienced this.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.820
They saw the hand of God.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.860
It was the magicians to Pharaoh

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.460
that declared after a few of those plagues,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.540
this is nothing more than the finger of God.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:06.100
They recognized that God was moving and working.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.340
And we find that here,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.620
the first level of instruction

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.700
is to declare to these children,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.860
to a generation to come,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.260
the might and power of God.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.180
You know, our God is mighty.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.180
He's all-powerful.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.580
We use the theological term

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.980
to describe the power of God

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.460
that He is omnipotent,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.460
that He's all-powerful.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.380
And I believe at times that perhaps

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.500
it's difficult for us to even fully comprehend

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.900
all that that means.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.580
There's nothing too hard for Him.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.700
The Word of God declares

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.780
all throughout the Scriptures

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.820
the fact that He is the Almighty God.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.620
The omnipotent God reigneth.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.060
We read in Revelation.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.340
We read in Genesis in the beginning, God.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.540
And what did He say?

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.940
He said, let there be light.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.420
There's light.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.180
Right?

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.300
He is the power of creation.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.460
You read in Revelation,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.220
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.260
You read throughout the Word of God

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.740
in Genesis 18.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.140
Is there anything too hard for the Lord?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140
Jeremiah says,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.300
O Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.780
By Thy great power,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.180
nothing is too difficult.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.580
Nothing is too hard for Thee.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.140
With God, all things are possible.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.340
And we find that the generation to come

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.900
needs to know the might and power of God.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.820
Our children, they need to know

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.220
the might and the power of God.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.980
And you find that it begins, you say,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.260
well, they asked about the testimonies

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.580
and the statutes and the judgments.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.900
Yeah, but before we get to that,

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.780
we need to let the children know

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.980
where we were.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.700
We were in Egypt.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.980
We were in bondage.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.340
And God brought us out.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.820
What does Egypt represent in the Word of God?

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.980
The world.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.740
Typology.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.980
It represents the world.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.620
We could think about the way in which

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.460
God brought the children of Israel

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.860
out of Egypt.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.980
And we could draw parallels

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.300
to New Testament redemption.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.260
Amen?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.820
You can draw those parallels quite easily

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.580
when you begin to see how the 10th plague,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.660
the death of the firstborn,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.260
the Passover, right?

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.940
The blood that had to be applied

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.500
in Christ, our Passover.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.180
And the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.500
went to the cross of Calvary

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.380
to shed His precious blood for us.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.100
When we begin to look at the Passover

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.220
and you understand that it was not only

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.820
a memorial of what God did

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.300
in bringing them out of Egypt,

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.740
but it was a picture of Messiah

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.620
who would come and provide

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.059
the way of salvation

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:52.620
and we pay the price of our redemption.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.900
We find that there's a great parallel

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.860
when you look at the exodus,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.900
the children of Israel leaving Egypt

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.740
and you look at redemption for us

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.980
as the people of God.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.900
A great parallel.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.940
Listen, God brought us out of Egypt.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.700
God delivered us.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.740
He saved us.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.980
He changed us.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.980
We find that the might and power of God

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.420
is first given to this next generation.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.500
Notice as we continue looking,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.940
notice in v. 23, the Bible says,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.740
and He, speaking of the Lord,

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.580
He brought us out from fence

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.900
that He might bring us in

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.820
to give us the land which He sware

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.140
unto our fathers.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.140
In v. 23, I think as you look

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.140
at the beginning portion of this verse,

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.940
you see the plan and purpose of God.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.860
You know our God has a plan and a purpose.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.700
The Bible says that He brought us out

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.340
from fence that He might bring us in.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.980
He didn't bring them out to just leave them

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.860
in the wilderness.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.940
He brought them out to bring them in.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.660
Amen?

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.660
And we think about new times.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.040
as New Testament believers,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.460
as New Testament Christians,

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.620
and we think about the truth of redemption

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.420
that He delivered us from our sin

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.380
and He brought us to a place of being redeemed,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.060
and He has a plan for us

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.780
that as we're in Christ,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.220
that we are to walk in Christ

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.420
and to live as children of the light

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.860
because He's delivered us from that bondage.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.420
And we find here that the children

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.420
would be given this instruction

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.260
that God has a plan and a purpose.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.220
God has a purpose for your life.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.500
He has a plan for your life.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.660
He had a plan and a purpose for us.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.100
We understand as we read

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.300
throughout the Old Testament

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.860
or read of the children of Israel

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.340
in this particular setting,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.060
we understand that they wandered in the wilderness.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.500
That was not God's plan.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.220
God's plan was not that He would deliver them from Egypt

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.700
so that they would wander in the wilderness,

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.900
but because of their unbelief.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.940
What happened when Moses sent those spies?

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.340
We sing it with the children.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.500
Twelve men went up to spy on Canaan.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.860
Ten were bad.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.380
Two were good.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.140
Right?

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.180
Those ten bad spies, they come back

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.220
and they say they're giants in the land

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.180
and we're not able.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.780
I mean, we're just going to be consumed.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.780
It was better when we were in Egypt.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.740
Right?

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.660
Joshua and Caleb rent their clothes.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.660
They never denied for a moment

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.740
that they did not have fortified cities.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.300
They never denied for a moment

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.380
that there were not giants in the land.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.020
They simply declared that our God is greater.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.780
And our God is able

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.900
because our God has a plan and a purpose.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.140
And they picked up stones

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.460
and they were ready to stone Joshua and Caleb.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.180
So what happened?

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.180
God said they're all going to die.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.020
And over the period of the wilderness wanderings,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.980
that generation died.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.820
We find now that this generation

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.460
is preparing to enter into the land.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.220
And we find that the plan and the purpose of God

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.780
for us and our lives and we'd understand,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.300
listen, God saved us,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.860
but He saved us for a purpose.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.380
And He has a plan for us.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.100
And He did not, listen,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.620
salvation is so much more

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.060
than just some kind of fire insurance policy.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.780
That man, I'm not going to go to the lake of fire when I die.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.460
I've been saved.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.940
Now I can just live however I want to live.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.900
That's not what it's about.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.180
It's about living for Christ.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:53.060
Doing what He has commissioned us to do.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.940
Not only do we see the plan and purpose of God

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.420
in the beginning of v. 23,

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.740
but I believe that we see the faithfulness of God

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.180
in v. 23.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.820
Notice at the end of the verse

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.340
where the Bible says to give us the land

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.020
which He sware unto our fathers.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.620
Aren't you thankful this evening

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.700
that our God is faithful?

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.780
We sing, great is Thy faithfulness.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.020
We find that it is Jeremiah

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.460
that would pen those words

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.780
in the book of Lamentations

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.100
after seeing the destruction of the city,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.140
after the Babylonians came in,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.660
and he said, great is Thy faithfulness.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.220
We find that Paul would testify

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.340
on a number of occasions in the New Testament

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.340
that our God is faithful.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.580
It's there in 1 Thessalonians 5

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.420
where it says,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.860
faithful is he that calleth you

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.060
who also will do it.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.460
Listen, we have a faithful God.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.620
He is trustworthy.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.860
He is dependable.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.380
Every promise that He has made,

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.940
He will fulfill.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.540
The Lord is not slack concerning His promise.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.540
We know contextually that that is given

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.220
in 2 Peter 3 with regard to the coming of the Lord

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.740
when Jesus said, I will come again.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.660
And there are people that are scoffing and mocking

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.340
and saying, where is His return?

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.820
Where is His appearing?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.540
And Peter says, the Lord is not slack

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.300
concerning His promise,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.740
but is longsuffering to us, Lord,

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.100
not willing that any should perish,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.820
but that all should come to repentance.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.780
I want you to understand that the truth

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.500
in 2 Peter 3 directly related

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.220
to the promise of His coming.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.580
We understand that, but broadly speaking,

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.820
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.820
What He has promised, He will fulfill.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.180
You say, well, I'm not seeing it.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.340
You just stay faithful.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.340
Don't get weary in well-doing.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.260
Galatians 6.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.100
We find the truth in Philippians 1.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.380
In verse 6, being confident in this very thing,

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.860
that He which hath begun a good work in you

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.540
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.660
Our God is faithful.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.580
And this answer that has been given

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.980
starting in verse 21 to the inquiry that is made

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.620
you notice the depth of the instruction

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.500
that they would understand the might and power of God,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.220
the plan and purpose of God,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.740
the faithfulness of God.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.860
We see even here the eternality of God,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.900
for He swear unto our fathers.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.660
It was to Abraham, as we've studied in the book of Genesis,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.380
that the promise of a land and a seed was given.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.620
And that promise was reiterated.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.580
And we find that even as Jacob would go down into Egypt,

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.420
that he was concerned and he was confused

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.860
because of all that was going on,

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.420
but God had sent Joseph there to preserve life.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.660
And through all of those circumstances,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.660
and God says to Jacob,

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.220
don't fear to go down there,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.420
I'm going to go with you

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.380
and I'm going to build there of thee a great nation.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.580
And that's what God did.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.380
And Joseph, when he's dying,

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.940
he makes this mention in Genesis chapter number 50,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.100
as he is there dying,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.380
and it says here,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.660
and God will surely visit you

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.500
and bring you out of this land

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.580
unto the land which He swore to Abraham,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.620
to Isaac, and to Jacob.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.740
That's Genesis 50 and verse 24.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.300
Joseph believed the promise of God.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.620
Amen?

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.300
And we find here that these,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.420
that would inquire,

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.660
they needed to understand the faithfulness of God,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.140
the eternality of God.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.900
Notice in verse 24,

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.660
and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.580
So notice the progression of what's going on.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.340
Excuse me, mom, dad.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.940
What mean the testimonies, statutes, and judgments

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.700
which the Lord our God hath commanded you?

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.740
Well, you understand that we are in Egypt.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.580
And God demonstrated His power

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.620
and He delivered us from Egypt.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.180
And He brought us out of thins

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.900
to bring us into this land.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.900
And it's the land that He promised unto our fathers.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.660
And God is faithful to do that

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.220
which He's promised to do.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.100
And when we come and we understand

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.820
that God delivered us out from Egypt

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.740
and He has this plan and this purpose

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.220
to bring us into this land,

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.420
that He commanded us these statutes.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.980
He gave us His law.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.980
He gave us that which would be profitable for us.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.380
We notice that it says,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.460
and the Lord commanded us in verse 24

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.620
to do all these statutes

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.620
to fear the Lord our God for our good always.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.820
That He might preserve us alive

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.900
as it is at this day.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.180
And it shall be our righteousness

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.540
if we observe to do all these commandments

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.380
before the Lord our God

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.020
as He hath commanded us.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.620
I believe that here in these verses of Scripture

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.100
that really we see the goodness of God on display.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.020
How good of God to give these statutes,

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.700
to give these commandments to His people.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.100
And it says here that the Lord commanded us

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.740
to do all these statutes

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.380
to fear the Lord our God, notice,

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.220
for our good always.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.060
You ever have somebody tell you to do something

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.780
and then they don't really provide you

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.340
the specific, detailed instructions

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.580
on how to do whatever it is

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.660
that they are telling you to do?

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.620
And you in your best attempt

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.140
seek to do what you've been asked to do?

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.380
And they say, no, no, no, that's not how you do it.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.140
You're not doing it the right way.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.100
I say, why don't you show me how to do it?

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.420
Right? Do you ever feel like saying that?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.980
I mean, if you're not giving me the directions,

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.100
you told me to do this,

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.300
and I'm doing the best that I can do.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.140
But in my best attempt,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.700
all I'm hearing is the criticism.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.780
Nope, that's not the right way.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.940
No, that's not how you do it.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.620
No, that's not...

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.100
See, God doesn't do that.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.580
God said, here are My statutes.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.420
Here are My testimonies.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.340
Here are My judgments.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.780
Here's how you are to behave.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.420
Here's how you're to live.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.460
These are the things that you do

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.380
that will be good for you.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.540
And so when you begin to think about it in this way,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.380
I believe that it will help you

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.660
to have a greater appreciation

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.020
for the statutes, the testimonies, and the judgments.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.660
When we begin to understand that God in His goodness

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.100
has given us these truths.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.860
See, today we're living in an era

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.820
in which so many people, I hear it so often,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.980
that they look at the Bible as simply being a rule book.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:07.060
That the Bible simply contains do's and don'ts.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.420
That the Bible simply is trying to dictate how I live my life.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:18.660
Well, when we understand the way in which the Bible was given and the God who gave us

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.620
the Bible, we understand that He gave it to us for our good.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.180
He gave it to us for our good.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:30.700
I have, of course, moving into the parsonage in the last week, we've had some things to

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.900
put together.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.740
I've installed six ceiling fans.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.980
And in installing those ceiling fans, I'm thankful for the instruction manual that came

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.700
with them.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.740
All but one were very easy to put in.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.340
The one that was not easy to put in, I was ready to take back to the store.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:55.300
But the reality is that those instructions were given to help you complete the task.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.860
I'm thankful on that sixth ceiling fan.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.140
It's the one in our living room.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.980
Holly said, I like how it looks.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.380
I think I want that one.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.100
So we bought it.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.820
And we opened up the directions and began to follow.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.620
And step number one, put on the blades.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.620
I thought, what in the world?

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:20.100
I put up ceiling fans so many times, I never put the blades on first.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.260
I mean, now I got to work around the blades while I'm trying to hang it up.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.340
That doesn't make any sense.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:32.140
So I'm going to skip to step number six, when it's talking about how to mount the thing.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.020
And that's why I'm being very transparent with you.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.860
And I begin reading step number six, and I'm going through, and I'm like, all right, here's

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.860
what we got to do.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.860
And we're going to do this and this.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.700
And I'm like, this is going to be a problem.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.740
Because if I do step number six before I do step number one, I'm going to have a ceiling

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.620
fan mounted without any blades, because there's not going to be any way to get the blades

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.460
on it.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.580
So what did I do?

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.580
I went back to page number one, and I said, I guess I ought to begin with step number

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.860
one.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.740
And now I have a ceiling fan that has blades, and it rotates, and it produces air, and there's

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.620
a light.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.260
But it's because I followed the directions.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.700
Somebody who was the engineer that designed that particular ceiling fan model put together

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:25.060
a set of instructions that, if followed, allows for the final product to work.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.540
Is that fair to say it that way?

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:33.140
So what if I, as the operator, decide I'm going to do it my way?

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.460
I've already installed five ceiling fans.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.500
I mean, between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, I did five of them in the house.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.860
I did three of them in the rental that we're staying in.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.500
So man, I've installed a lot of ceiling fans in the last six months.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.440
So now all of a sudden, it's going to tell me to do it a different way.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.220
It wouldn't have worked out well.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.620
Because as the operator, as the installer, there were some things that I did not know

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.580
that the engineer who designed it knew.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.260
Does that make sense?

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.300
It's a simple illustration.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.660
But when we begin to think about this book, and we think about the God who created us,

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:20.860
the God who is the judge of the earth, by the way, the God who loves us with an un...I

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:31.420
mean, just a love that is beyond measure, He says, I love you so much that I'm going

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:45.180
to give you testimonies, statutes, and judgments for your good.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:54.780
I in my goodness, I in my grace and in my mercy, I'm going to give these things to you.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.500
And by the way, it's in your best interest to take heed.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.160
Remember in verse number 18, it says, and thou shalt do that which is right and good

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.180
in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with thee.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.420
Here in verse number 24, it says that the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:17.500
to fear the Lord our God for our good always.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:26.940
Notice the next phrase, that He might preserve us alive as it is at this day.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.100
I mentioned already that as you study through the law and you study through the book of

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.540
Leviticus in particular, you'll begin to find that there were certain ways in which you

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.060
could break the laws, and the consequence was death.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.060
There were to be stoned.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.500
There were grave consequences.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.020
And so, how is it that I avoid that punishment?

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.580
I better take heed to what I'm supposed to do.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:58.420
And so, we think about this and we understand as we would look to the land even in which

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:06.660
we live, a land that is at one point, I think things are changing now, but a land of laws,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.520
a land of rights and wrongs.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.760
How is it that I can retain my freedom, avoid being incarcerated while I follow the laws?

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.800
And it's good for me, right?

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.200
I mean, I don't have to fear being pulled over or having an interaction with a police

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.040
officer if I'm being obedient to the law of the land.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:34.200
I don't have to fear the judgment of God if I'm walking in His statutes, if I'm being

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.160
obedient to what He's commanded.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.040
And so, we find here that He says it's for our good always, that He, God, might preserve

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.800
us alive as it is this day, and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.720
these commandments before the Lord our God as He hath commanded us.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.560
Now, I begin to look at these answers that are provided, and we begin to look at the

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:03.480
attributes of God that are revealed in verses 21 through 25, His might, His power, the fact

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.500
that He has a plan and a purpose, the fact that He's faithful and that He's eternal,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.880
the goodness of God is on display.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.800
And we find that these that have made the inquiry are given this detailed instruction

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.040
and they're told it's for our good.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.540
That's a great bit of instruction, is it not?

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.880
It's so much better than just saying, well, God did and so we just got to do whatever

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.480
God says to do, you know, just fall in line.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.200
No, no, no, let's give the instruction, let's seize that opportunity.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:46.760
And God gives to His people this bit of instruction, obedience to the law of the Lord, as we read

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.960
in verses 24 and 25, obedience would result in the blessings of the covenant.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.880
You begin to read through the book of Leviticus, and you find that the Word of God will say

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.920
that if you're obedient, if you do these things, then I will do these things.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.160
And God is faithful to do what He said He will do.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:14.200
If you obey me, if you follow me, if you do what I've commanded you, then I will do these

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200
things.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.740
And He does.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.620
But if you disobey, well, then you got to face the consequences.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.520
In fact, in just a few chapters here in the book of Deuteronomy, we'll find that the Word

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.000
of God says it this way, that God will lay before you.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.320
Notice turn over a few pages, Deuteronomy chapter number 11.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:45.040
In Deuteronomy chapter number 11, in verse number 26, notice what the Word of God says,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.680
behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.560
Now if it stops there, and I say to you, which one do you want?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.560
What's your answer?

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.560
A blessing.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.600
I don't want a curse, amen?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:12.400
If you say, I want a curse, you need to go to the hospital, seriously.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:23.160
But notice the condition in verse 27, a blessing, notice that word if, a blessing if ye obey

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.260
the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:36.800
And verse 28, a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.360
turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.960
ye have not known.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.080
Verse 31 says, for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.320
your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it and dwell therein, and ye shall observe

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.360
to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:09.760
A blessing and a curse, the condition is obedience.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.880
A blessing if you obey, a curse if you will not obey.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.640
And so we find that God has given to us His word.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:25.360
You know, there are many people around the world that are following false world religions

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:33.340
that serve a plurality of deities that have absolutely no idea what they are to do or

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.480
what they are not to do to have favor from their deities.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.500
They live in constant conflict.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.920
They have no reign and they think that they have offended the reign God.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.880
They have no, I mean you just fill in the blank and they're constantly conflicted and

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:55.560
they don't know what to do and how to do in order to appease their deities.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:01.960
But the Lord God Almighty, because He loves us, He said, I'm going to give you

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.480
I'm going to give you a Word.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.020
I'm going to give you a book

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.280
that's going to contain testimonies,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.160
statutes, and judgments.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.240
And it's for your good.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.860
And we have to understand

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.320
that there's a generation

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.640
just as there was here in Deuteronomy,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.560
that there was going to come a time

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.400
when Thy Son asketh Thee in time to come.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.700
There's going to come a time in your life.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.080
There's going to come a time

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.780
when it's already come in my life,

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.820
and for some of you,

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.240
it's already come in your life.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.820
But there's going to come a time

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.160
when your children say why?

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.800
Why do we do these things?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.860
Oh, that God would help us to be prepared

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.100
to seize that opportunity.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.220
Because that inquiry is a fair inquiry

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.980
that results in an awesome opportunity.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.160
Notice in the New Testament.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.040
Turn to 2 Peter if you will.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.040
We'll close with two references

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.420
from the New Testament.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.360
The obedience of the people of God

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.400
as it's mentioned there in Deuteronomy

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.920
would result in the blessings of the covenant.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.560
We find that it was there in v. 25

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.080
that it mentioned about the righteousness.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.520
It shall be our righteousness.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.080
And really, that's speaking not of salvation,

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.400
but really a right standing civically,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.340
if you will,

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.860
with regard to those things

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.300
that they were dealing with.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.780
And we understand that here

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.460
as we would look to the New Testament

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.140
that God has continued.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.700
I'm thankful that God has fulfilled the law.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.700
He fulfilled the law.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.140
But you know, we're under grace,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.620
not under the law.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.260
And I'm thankful for that.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.220
But there's this school of thinking

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.060
that has this idea

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.500
that because we're under grace

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520
and no longer under law

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.960
that we can just do whatever we want to do

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.160
and live however we want to live.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.160
And that's a lie from the devil.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.000
It's a lie from the devil.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.520
Because the reality is that

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.320
Paul speaks very plainly

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.960
in the book of Galatians

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.640
about the fact that we are not to use

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.640
our liberty as a license to sin.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.200
And we don't use our liberty in that way.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.520
Yes, I am free from the law.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.560
What a blessing.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.400
We're no longer under the condemnation.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.380
What a blessing.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.100
But now that I'm in Christ,

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.860
now I have the liberty to serve Him

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.260
as His child.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.100
And we find here that in the New Testament,

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.140
the truth of God's commandments

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.340
still exists for us.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.780
And many of the Ten Commandments,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.260
in fact, all other than keeping the Sabbath

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.740
are mentioned in the New Testament.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.020
You study through the New Testament

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.020
and you'll find that there are behaviors

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.740
that we as the people of God are to follow.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.440
And we find that the Word of God says

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.620
in 1 Peter 1,

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.360
we're in 2 Peter 1,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.200
but in 1 Peter,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.480
he talks about the fact that we are to be holy

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.640
even as God is holy.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.380
That's a reference back to Leviticus.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.280
That we're to not behave ourselves.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.800
We're not to follow that former conversation.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.680
We are to be holy as God is holy.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.920
But notice here in 2 Peter 1,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.560
notice what Peter says.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.800
Now Peter walked with Christ.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.600
Peter had the unique privilege

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.460
of being at the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.340
It was Peter, James, and John,

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.700
three that were at that event.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.320
And Peter here will speak of that event

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.580
when they were at the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.420
And we find today that there are people that say,

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.220
well, if God would just speak to me,

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.940
if He'd just appear to me,

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.340
and so on and so forth.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.180
But we find that Peter that walked with Christ,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.720
that heard the voice of God,

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.460
there at the Mount of Transfiguration,

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.140
notice what he says in v. 19

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.260
as he would speak about the written Word of God,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:01.260
we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.380
Now notice this phrase.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.380
Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed,

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.940
as unto a light that shineth in a dark place

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.040
until the day dawn and the day star arise

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.740
in your hearts.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.900
We said this as our title this evening

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.060
from Deuteronomy 6.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.480
For our good always.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.100
We noted that in v. 18 of Deuteronomy 6,

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.940
it says that it may be well with thee.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.320
Here in 2 Peter 1 and v. 19,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.180
Peter says whereunto ye do well

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.260
that ye take heed.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.360
It's in our best interest to obey God.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.740
It's in our best interest to know

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.020
what God has said.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.760
I'm gonna have a hard time obeying the Word of God

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.040
if I don't know the Word of God.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.040
Amen?

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.240
As someone said to me not long ago

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.680
about some of the various laws of the land

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.700
and so on and so forth,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.400
and they made the admission themselves

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.080
that they were ignorant as to some of the laws

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.520
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.760
And I would venture to say that most all of us

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.080
are ignorant of some of the laws in Virginia.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.060
But you know that ignorance is no excuse.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.660
You get pulled over and the police officer says,

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.860
you violated this.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.420
You say, well, I didn't know.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.660
You got a license, man.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.780
You're responsible to know.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.100
I lived here for just a few weeks.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.180
Actually, just a few days.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.180
I got pulled over because I had a Virginia license plate,

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.100
but I had not updated my inspection sticker

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.980
because the lady at DMV told me I had 30 days.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.800
She was wrong, and the police officer

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.080
was there to enforce it.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.480
And I said, sir, I am very sorry.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.300
I didn't know.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.140
I'll go right now, and I did.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.840
I went straight to the station

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.000
and got that inspection sticker put on.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.880
But ignorance is no excuse.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.000
Listen, we need to know the Word of God.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.920
The children of Israel, when they inquire and say,

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.160
hey, these testimonies, these statutes,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.920
and these judgments, they had to know them

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.040
if they were gonna have the benefit of them.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.120
It's for our good always.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.660
If you do well, that you take heed.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.180
Notice in 1 John 5, we'll close here.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.300
1 John 5 and verse number three.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.820
It's in John 14 and verse 15 that the Bible says,

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.060
if you love Me, keep My commandments.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.340
And here in 1 John 5 and verse number three,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:37.740
the Bible says, for this is the love of God,

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.580
that we keep His commandments.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.740
And notice this, His commandments are not grievous.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.120
Why are they not burdensome?

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.440
That's what the word grievous means.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.120
Why is it that they're not burdensome?

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.880
Because I understand that it's from a loving God

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.400
that He's given me these commandments,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.780
and that it's for my good.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.300
It's not just that God's trying to make robots.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.900
It's not just that God's trying to make people do, no.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.920
God is the judge of all the world,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.200
and He's going to judge, and He says,

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.780
here are My statutes, My commandments, My judgments.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.100
Here's My word for you to obey,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.500
and it's in your best interest.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.060
And as a child of God, as a believer,

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.980
a follower of Jesus Christ,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.160
His commandments are not grievous,

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.580
because I understand that He has given them to me

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.580
out of love, and He's given them to me for my good.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.540
Oh, what a great opportunity that we have.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.940
And all the way back in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.520
God says to the children of Israel,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.620
listen, there's going to come a time

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.100
when your children are going to ask,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:52.100
what mean these testimonies, these statutes, these judgments?

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.580
And here's how you answer them.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.000
Let them know where you were.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.100
And let them know what God did for you.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.460
And let them know how God has a plan and a purpose.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.820
And let them know that it's from the goodness

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.480
and love of God that He's given us these commandments,

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.600
and that it's for our good always.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.940
See, the reality is that the generation to come,

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.940
see, my children don't know anything about living in Egypt.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.980
They don't know anything about living in Egypt.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.780
Some of you have children that don't know anything

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.040
about living in Egypt.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.680
When they were born, you were saved.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.360
You were in church.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.480
You were serving God.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.500
They don't know about Egypt.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.380
But can I tell you that Egypt has an allure to it?

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:44.900
Right?

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.520
Come on, don't look at me like I'm crazy.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.340
The devil tries to use all that's within his arsenal

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.700
to attack and to cause,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.140
and so our children need to understand,

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.720
listen, there's nothing good in Egypt.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.220
There's nothing good in the world.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.700
He's delivered us from the world.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.840
And you've been blessed to be born in a home

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.720
where you have parents that are Christians,

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.960
and God's given us this for our good,

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.420
but yet we have children that are walking away.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.960
It's sad.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.000
I'm not speaking of anyone in particular.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.360
I'm speaking broadly in Christendom.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360
It's happening.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.619
The statistics are alarming,

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.600
and I just wonder.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.200
I sat down with a pastor probably 15 years ago,

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.400
and he asked me a question.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.220
He said, what do you think is wrong with our church?

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.040
He was my pastor.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.000
I was intimidated by the question.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.040
I was about 24, 25 years old, maybe 25, 26 years old,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.880
and 15 years ago makes me not as young

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.679
as I'd like for it to make me,

00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:57.520
but I was about Jared's age,

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.080
and he asked me that question, and I said this.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.600
I said, can I be honest?

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:07.540
He said, I want you to be honest, and he said, honestly, here's what I think.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:15.640
I think for too often a young person comes and asks a pastor or a person in leadership,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.540
why do we do the things that we do?

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:26.020
And that person in leadership does not take the time to instruct and simply says, do as

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.940
you've been told.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:34.940
You're a rebel, and it's causing our young people to leave the church.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:44.020
It's happened, and God has given us, listen, we have a rich answer to give, and it's an

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:52.940
answer that will help establish and make just a strong, firm foundation.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.620
Here's what God's done for us.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:51:02.480
God's so good to us, and He's given us these things for our good always.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.480
Let's pray.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480
Father, we love You.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.620
We thank You for loving us.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.100
God, we thank You that You love us so much with an unconditional love, an everlasting

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:15.180
love that You have given us Thy Word.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:24.700
Admittedly, this evening, there are areas in which we fall short.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.340
Our desire is to be obedient to You and to Your Word.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:33.140
We understand that we do well that we take heed thereunto.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.220
We understand that Your commandments are not grievous, they're not burdensome, because

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:44.860
we understand that You've given them to us out of love and for our good.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:51.300
I pray, God, that You would use the truth from Thy Word that has been given this evening

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:59.620
to help us shape a proper perspective with regard to the inquiries that we must face,

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:09.620
and that we'd be prepared to provide the instruction that would help to establish a firm foundation.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.500
I think of families in our church with younger children.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.940
God, I pray that You'd help the parents.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:23.620
Father, I think of grandparents in our church that have grandchildren.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:30.340
Those of us that will have the opportunity to influence the young people of our church,

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:39.140
God, would You help us to be able to provide good instruction?

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:45.460
I thank You so much for Your Word, for the difference that it's made in my life, and

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.900
I pray that You would help us, Lord, to influence a next generation.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.980
Would You move and work in our midst this evening as only You can?

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.460
I pray that You'd help us.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.420
We'll give You the glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.180
Would You stand with me?
