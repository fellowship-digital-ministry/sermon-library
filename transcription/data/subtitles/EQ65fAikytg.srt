1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
us this evening either, and our revival meeting starts next week, and so I'm going to preach

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,840
a couple of messages today on really preparation for revival, if you will, and on Wednesday

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,239
evening for our prayer and Bible study, I'll share a short thought with you with regard

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,239
to revival, and we'll spend an extended period of time in prayer.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,440
I mentioned this last Wednesday evening that if you study revival historically, you will

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:31,159
find that in every movement of God, of revival, it's always preceded by prayer, always.

7
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:40,200
And it's amazing how that God has just designed it to be so that He uses prayer, and it's

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,580
what a privilege of ours as His people to go to Him in prayer, and it moves the hand

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,599
of God, and it's such an amazing privilege.

10
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:53,779
Psalm 85, as you have your place there, I want you to also take and turn to 2 Chronicles

11
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:58,299
chapter number 7 and hold your place in 2 Chronicles 7 and verse number 14.

12
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,740
I'm really not going to deal much with that particular verse of Scripture this morning,

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,779
though it's probably one of the most familiar verses when you start talking about revival.

14
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:13,099
And as I go through the message this morning, I will make some reference back to 2 Chronicles

15
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,980
7 and verse number 14, so I want you to have your place there, if you will.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,260
And here in the Psalms, in Psalm 85 and verse number 6, the psalmist says this,

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:34,019
"'Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?'

18
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,139
That thy people may rejoice in thee."

19
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm going to be preaching from Joel this evening and dealing with the subject of when the joy

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,599
is withered away.

21
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,720
And here in Psalm 85 and verse number 6, the psalmist says, "'Wilt thou not revive us

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,639
again, notice that thy people may rejoice in thee?'

23
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,319
Rejoicing is the outworking of joy.

24
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,879
When the joy is withered away, we're not rejoicing."

25
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,120
And that's tonight's message, so you want a preview, there it is.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Come back tonight, we'll deal with the entirety of the message.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,119
But we find here that the psalmist is crying out for this revival that only can be sent

28
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,119
by God.

29
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,399
Solomon, as he's dedicating the temple as the context of 2 Chronicles chapter number

30
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:21,639
7, and you read the prayer in chapter number 6 and all that is going on with the sacrifices

31
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,399
as you enter into the seventh chapter of the book of 2 Chronicles, and you find that God

32
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:32,399
then speaks to Solomon in response to the prayer that Solomon has offered as a dedication

33
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,399
of the temple.

34
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:39,360
And God says this in verse number 14, "'If my people, which are called by my name, shall

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,720
humble themselves and pray and seek my face,' and then it says this, "'and turn from their

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,639
wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their

37
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,639
land.'"

38
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,759
This morning, as you see in the bulletin, I want to preach a message that I've simply

39
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,839
entitled, How to be Revival Ready.

40
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,559
How to be Revival Ready.

41
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:06,520
Have you ever been asked the question, are you ready?

42
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,720
That question necessitates context, does it not?

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,399
Am I ready for what?

44
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,039
You don't just say to somebody, hey, are you ready?

45
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,440
What's the context if I'm ready?

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,559
Some of us fellas, we ask our wives occasionally, are you ready?

47
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,039
Now that could be a dangerous question.

48
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,240
And we're trying to find out if they're prepared, are they ready for leaving?

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,639
The word ready carries with it the idea of being prepared, fitted, furnished with that

50
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:39,160
which is necessary, disposed in a manner suited to the purpose, the idea a ship that

51
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,000
is ready for sea.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,559
I like this definition of the word ready, in a state of preparation so as to need no

53
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,839
delay.

54
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:56,940
We think about this subject of being revival ready, I'm mindful, and I won't be dealing

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,600
with the context of this this morning, but if you are mindful of the account that's given

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,960
to us in Matthew 25 of the ten virgins, and the context of that portion of Scripture there

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,520
in Matthew chapter number 25, when the bridegroom came, you will be mindful of the fact that

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,279
there were five that were ready.

59
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,239
But there were five that were not ready.

60
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,480
They were not in a state of preparation as to need no delay, no, they were running around

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,640
trying to look for oil for their lamps, right?

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,019
They were not ready, they were not prepared.

63
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:37,140
As we embark on having this revival meeting, and it will begin next Sunday, Pastor Mike

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Edwards will be with us, but you understand this morning that revival does not happen

65
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,739
just because you put something on the calendar.

66
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:49,980
Just because you invite a guest speaker, just because you have some extra services throughout

67
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:56,579
the week, does not mean that the result is going to actually be revival.

68
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,660
I would say this, revival is not going to happen.

69
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,980
You are, let me put it this way, we are not as a church going to be revival ready by accident.

70
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,019
We think about this subject of how to be revival ready, I will admit at the onset of the message

71
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,220
this morning that this is not an exhaustive list.

72
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,380
Perhaps as you would just review and meditate upon the thoughts from this morning, perhaps

73
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:28,619
you will add additional things to the list of how you personally can be revival ready,

74
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,579
but I want to just share with you four thoughts this morning that I believe would be impactful

75
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:39,500
and helpful for us that would enable us to be in a place where we are revival ready.

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,459
This morning we no doubt had some various things that took place in our attempt to come

77
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:50,980
to church this morning, and I hope that when we get to church that we're ready for church.

78
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,299
We come expecting and anticipating that God's going to work, and as we sing the songs and

79
00:05:56,299 --> 00:06:01,899
as we have the opportunity to worship through song, that our hearts are being prepared,

80
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:07,540
our hearts are being ready to receive the message from God's Word.

81
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,619
And so this morning, as we think about this how to be revival ready, number one if you're

82
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:16,579
taking notes, I believe it starts with contemplation, contemplation.

83
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:22,820
The idea of the word contemplation is the act of the mind in considering with attention.

84
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,779
I believe that as we would think about that definition of contemplation, that we'd understand

85
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,500
that there is an object of our contemplation.

86
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,660
We see that it's the act of the mind in considering with attention.

87
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,579
We're not talking about contemplating the stars or contemplating some other object.

88
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:44,019
We're speaking this morning on how to be revival ready, to be in the place where the psalmist

89
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,420
says, will thou not revive us again?

90
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,000
Are we ready for revival?

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,140
Are we longing for revival?

92
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,660
And we find that it will begin with this contemplation, and the object of our contemplation is our

93
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,940
lives.

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,660
It's a process of examination, really, which we'll come to as we begin to put our lives,

95
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,940
if you will, under the microscope that we're considering with attention, that we're asking

96
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,140
ourselves the questions with regard to our behavior being pleasing in the eyes of the

97
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Lord.

98
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,100
Ephesians chapter number 5 and verse number 10, the Bible says, proving what is acceptable

99
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,420
in the sight of the Lord.

100
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,220
That word proving would often be used within those that worked with metals, and it would

101
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,700
be that proving process that they would go through, and what a process that is.

102
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,540
In fact, the refinement of metals is often referenced throughout the Word of God.

103
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,980
As silver is tried, you'll see that referenced many times, not only with regard to the Bible

104
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:51,299
itself, but in us being refined as people, and God taking us through that refining fire.

105
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:57,100
That process in which we're going to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we're

106
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,519
going to examine our lives.

107
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,779
You know, we have the Lord's Supper table in front of me this morning, just due in remembrance

108
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:04,779
of me.

109
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,179
I'm so thankful of the truth of 1 Corinthians chapter number 11, and what a blessing.

110
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:14,260
I'm so thankful that God gave us the ordinance of the Lord's Supper so that we could remember

111
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,339
His death until He come.

112
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:21,140
It gives us that remembrance of what He did for us, the awful price that was paid for

113
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,700
our sin, but it also gives us that excitement of that expectation that soon He's going to

114
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,019
come.

115
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:35,700
But in verse number 28 of 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible says, but let a man examine himself.

116
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,820
But let a man examine himself.

117
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,859
And we think about that process of self-examination, honestly it's something that at times we'd

118
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,380
rather not engage in.

119
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,580
It's at times that we would rather not go through the process of self-examination.

120
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,460
But the reality is that it is good for us as the people of God to go through that process,

121
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,099
to contemplate, to consider with attention our lives and how does our behavior align

122
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,099
with the Word of God.

123
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:08,140
And as we begin to contemplate, as we begin to examine, I think about the church there

124
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,020
that is mentioned in the book of Revelation in the third chapter, the church of the Laodiceans.

125
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,260
Remember, they had an opinion about themselves that varied greatly from what God said about

126
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
them.

127
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,500
They were increased with goods and had need of nothing, but God said that they were poor,

128
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,059
miserable, and naked.

129
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,780
Their view was quite different than what God's assessment was.

130
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Their assessment and God's assessment were not aligned one with the other.

131
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,539
And this morning I believe that as we think about this matter of contemplation and we

132
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:46,659
consider it in light of Ephesians 5 and 1 Corinthians 11, that I believe it takes us

133
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:54,340
to a place where we will say as the psalmist did in Psalm 139, search me, O God.

134
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,539
Turn over there if you will to Psalm 139, you're in Psalm 85, so just turn several pages

135
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,059
over to Psalm 139.

136
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:06,419
on 139, and we find that the psalmist ends this particular chapter with this

137
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,499
wonderful declaration and really a prayer. And I believe this morning that

138
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:16,799
if we've not gone through the process of self-examination, that most likely we're

139
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,039
not going to come to the place where the psalmist is, that we say, Lord, search me.

140
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,059
We better go through a process of self-examination. You think about kids.

141
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,799
Did you clean your room? And mom's gonna come and inspect. You think about an

142
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,779
inspection. I know that at times when I worked in the corporate world, we'd have

143
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,579
audits, and everyone was always excited to see the auditors come. Not really, right?

144
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,219
If you work in the corporate world, you know when the auditors come. It is not

145
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:49,219
going to be a good day, week, however long they're gonna be there for. You want them

146
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:54,219
to leave before they arrive. That kind of a situation. And why? Because those

147
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:59,979
auditors are gonna dig in, and they're going to examine, they're going to

148
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:05,399
inspect, they're going to dig in to whatever the the systems are that you

149
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,939
have to ensure that things have been done according to the proper procedures.

150
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,619
You don't have to worry about the auditors coming if you've done things

151
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:19,939
right. The auditors don't have to be your enemy if you've done things right, and if

152
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:24,339
you've gone through and you've checked your own processes and ensured that

153
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,339
things are done in an appropriate manner, you don't have to fear the

154
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,659
auditors. And this morning, if we've not gone through the process of

155
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,739
self-examination, I doubt very highly that we would stand with the psalmist

156
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:44,379
and say, search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. Notice

157
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:51,619
verse 24, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way

158
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:57,339
everlasting. When I think about this first step that I've dealt with this

159
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,779
morning, this step of contemplation, and I think about the the way in which we

160
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,419
looked at 2 Chronicles chapter number 7 this morning, I believe that the

161
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:13,940
process of contemplation will humble us. I believe it will humble us. See, sometimes

162
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,099
we think too highly of ourselves. We think we got it all together. We forget

163
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:24,539
that we're sinners saved by grace. Amen? We forget that, as Paul said, I'm the

164
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,220
chief of sinners, but Christ saved me. I am what I am by the grace of God. And

165
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,259
sometimes we can feel like we've got everything together, and we just kind of

166
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,979
are doing it, and we're on the right path and doing everything within our power,

167
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:42,979
but I believe that as we really get into this process of contemplation, this

168
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:49,179
self-examination, that it'll have a way of humbling us. We ask God to search us and

169
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,940
show us, and then all of a sudden, God does a more thorough job than we do,

170
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,739
because we can deceive ourselves. Amen? And we find that God does a more thorough

171
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:02,660
job, and God will touch this area, and He'll touch this area, and He'll remind

172
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:09,059
us of this thing, and oh, this is a good process for us. It's appropriate

173
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:14,819
for us as the people of God. I believe it will bring humility. If my people,

174
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:21,179
which are called by my name, shall humble themselves. Humility. Someone said this,

175
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,099
that the greatest sin in the church house today is pride. There's probably

176
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:31,779
some validity to that statement. Oh, that God would humble us. I believe that if we

177
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,059
go through this process of contemplation, I believe that the humility will come.

178
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:43,459
Number two, after the contemplation, I believe there will come confession.

179
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:51,059
Confession. This, I believe, is the natural response to contemplation. I read

180
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,220
recently about someone that was asked what their greatest mistake was, and they

181
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,099
said, well, I can't really think of one. I hope that we would honestly evaluate and

182
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:05,419
go through a process of contemplation that will humble us, that will bring us

183
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,300
to a place of confession. See, there's not one amongst us that's reached a place

184
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
of sinless perfection. You know why? Because we're all still here. When you

185
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,579
get to heaven, then you've reached a place where there's not going to be any

186
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:24,899
more sin. Amen? Aren't you thankful for that? But until that day, we still have

187
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,660
this flesh, and there is still sin in our lives that needs to be dealt with, and as

188
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,139
we go through that process of contemplation, it leads us to that point

189
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,179
of confession. I want you to notice, we'll stick here with a couple of passages in

190
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,419
the book of Psalms. Turn back to Psalm 32, if you will, and look in Psalm 32, and

191
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:49,100
notice what the psalmist says here in this passage of Scripture. And I love how

192
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,859
he begins the Psalm, because for sure it is a wonderful thing to

193
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:59,419
be forgiven, to know that our sins are forgiven. I would say, as we look at this

194
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,779
verse of Scripture, in verse number one, the Bible says,

195
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:09,980
"...blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered." It's not

196
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,019
the idea of covering it, as in hiding it from God. It's the idea of we've been

197
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:20,940
forgiven by God. It's covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, and what

198
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,419
a blessing to know that we have been forgiven. Notice what the psalmist says

199
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:34,260
in verse number five, "...I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I

200
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:42,139
not hid." I acknowledged it. I've not hid it. I said, I will confess my transgressions

201
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:50,619
unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. Aren't you

202
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:55,100
thankful for forgiveness? Forgiveness is the promise that God has given us with

203
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,139
response to our confession. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and

204
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:04,459
just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, 1 John 1 and

205
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,100
verse number 9. And so we think about this subject of confession, and the

206
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,500
psalmist says, I acknowledged my sin, mine iniquity have I not hid. I've asked the

207
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,579
question before from this pulpit, but I believe it's worth repeating this

208
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:24,100
morning. Is God that is omniscient, does He know about your sin? Sure He does.

209
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:30,339
Did He know about the sin of Adam and Eve in the garden? Sure He did. When He

210
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,139
came walking, He already knew what they had done. He already knew that they had

211
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,820
taken of that which they were not to partake of, and they hid themselves. Why

212
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,859
did they hide themselves? Because they were shameful. They were ashamed of what

213
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:46,619
had happened. They not only hid themselves, but they tried to cover their

214
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:52,419
nakedness with those fig leaves because their eyes had been opened. God knows

215
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,579
about your sin. He knows about my sin. So who do we think we are that we're gonna

216
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:03,100
hide it from God? It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, does it? It makes

217
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,380
sense that we would say, as the psalmist does here in verse number 5, I

218
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,299
acknowledged my sin unto thee, mine iniquity have I not hid, because He knows

219
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:18,260
about it. And so therefore, I'm going to confess it to Him. I'm not gonna try to

220
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,380
hide it from Him. You ever have a situation where the little kid takes

221
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,899
something, the cookie he's not supposed to take, Joseph, last night, throw him right

222
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:32,779
under the bus, right? And Brianna's sitting in the other room and she says,

223
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:37,139
did he just eat a cookie off of that tray? Those were not to be eaten. I said,

224
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,380
get him. You know how the older sister is, right? And I don't think he

225
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,339
tried to hide it. It was like, yeah, actually I had two of them. But the

226
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:52,019
reality is, sometimes the kid tries to hide it, right? You see the cookie crumbs,

227
00:17:52,019 --> 00:18:00,100
the chocolate in the corner of the mouth. Joel, did you have a cookie? No, I don't

228
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,019
know what you're talking about, mom. You had a cookie all over your face. See, God knows,

229
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:11,619
right? Why would we try to hide it? It doesn't make any sense. He says, I will

230
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,220
confess my transgressions unto the Lord. Listen, you don't have to confess

231
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,820
them to any man. There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

232
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:33,419
He is our advocate. And we go to God, we say, Lord, would you forgive me? I'm gonna

233
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,539
confess. I'm gonna say the same thing about my sin that your Word says. I'm not

234
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,739
gonna try to cover it. I'm not gonna seek to excuse it. No, I'm gonna call it what

235
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:48,260
it is. And notice in Psalm 51, notice what David says. What a wonderful psalm. I was

236
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,659
actually gonna preach through this whole psalm this morning, and God led me in a

237
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:56,460
different direction. But I meditated much upon this psalm this past week, and I

238
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,059
would encourage you to do the same. But I want you to notice, this is the psalm of

239
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,260
David's repentance, and it says in verse number three of Psalm 51, for I

240
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,419
acknowledge my transgressions, my sin is ever before me. Notice what he says in

241
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:16,179
verse number four, against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy

242
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,619
sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when

243
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,380
thou judgest. Look down, if you will, at verse number seven. The Bible says, purge

244
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,260
me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

245
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:43,099
Verse 10, create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew in me a right, excuse me, renew a

246
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:50,979
right spirit within me. Oh, that desire to be clean. Not to simply be a little

247
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:57,340
cleaner, but to be clean. That God, as we go to Him in prayer, and we confess our

248
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,140
sin, after we've gone through that process of

249
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,880
of contemplation where we have

250
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,000
the act of the mind considering

251
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,660
with attention our lives

252
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,080
and doing that self-examination

253
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
and going through that process,

254
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,280
and it brings us that level of humility

255
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,980
that I then confess

256
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,480
against Thee and Thee only.

257
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,480
I acknowledge my sin, my transgression.

258
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,280
God, would You create in me a clean heart?

259
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,880
Proverbs 28 and verse number 13.

260
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,100
Very similar to what we've read earlier

261
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,380
in Psalm 32.

262
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,580
But it goes and gives us a further principle

263
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,780
if you will, where the Bible says this

264
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,020
in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13,

265
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,020
He that covereth his sins

266
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,300
shall not prosper.

267
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,860
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them

268
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,660
not the sins shall have mercy.

269
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,300
This verse reveals to me that it is possible

270
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,120
for each one of us to try to cover our sins.

271
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,020
Because the Bible says he that covereth his sins

272
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,060
shall not prosper.

273
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,940
We try to cover up.

274
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,900
We try to make it so no one else knows about it.

275
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,700
But God knows about it.

276
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,760
And can I tell you this?

277
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
God's definition of prosperity

278
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,260
is quite different than the world's definition

279
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,000
of prosperity.

280
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,120
There are times in which we have

281
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,480
falsely believed that God may be okay

282
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,020
with our behavior because God

283
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,840
is being long-suffering to us.

284
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
There are times in which we've maybe

285
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
been blinded to think that God is okay

286
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,400
with our behavior because we,

287
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,480
by the world's standards,

288
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,240
never had some measure of success or prosperity.

289
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,720
The Bible tells us in His presence

290
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,200
is fullness of joy.

291
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,920
The riches that we receive from God

292
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,560
in His presence and that close walk with Him,

293
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,480
that cannot be compared with what

294
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,000
the world would offer.

295
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm thankful that our God is long-suffering.

296
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,200
And I've often said over the years

297
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
that we ought never mistake

298
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,640
God's long-suffering for God's approval.

299
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Our God is a holy God who is never okay with sin.

300
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,840
So we confess.

301
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,800
We confess our sin.

302
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,120
That reference that we made in 2 Chronicles 7

303
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,160
in verse number 14,

304
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,120
it says at the end of those items

305
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,800
that are listed after humble themselves,

306
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
pray, seek My face,

307
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,560
it says, turn from their wicked ways.

308
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,160
That's confession.

309
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,880
That confession comes after that contemplation.

310
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
This week as we are seeking to be ready

311
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,800
for revival,

312
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,560
that we would spend some time contemplating,

313
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,200
inspecting, examining our lives,

314
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
and being truthful and honest with ourselves

315
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
and with God and saying,

316
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,880
God, search me and show me and reveal in me

317
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
those things that I need to stop doing,

318
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
those things that I need to start doing.

319
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
God, help me.

320
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,160
The sins of commission,

321
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,320
the sins of omission,

322
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,960
help me, God, to be clean.

323
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,440
And then we find that after the contemplation

324
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,080
and after the confession,

325
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,200
I believe number three,

326
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
there needs to be some cultivation.

327
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
Some cultivation.

328
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,040
The idea of preparing the soil of our hearts.

329
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,080
I mentioned this morning

330
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
that as we entered into the house of God

331
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,840
that our desire should have been

332
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
that I'm coming with an attitude of anticipation

333
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,200
and expectation is,

334
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
what does God have for me today?

335
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,800
What is it that I can learn through a song?

336
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
What is it that I can learn from another believer?

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,600
What is it that I can learn from the Word of God?

338
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,320
What is it that I can learn today?

339
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
What does God have for me?

340
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,960
And we come expecting to hear from God,

341
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
but our hearts have to be prepared for that.

342
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,480
There has to be that process of cultivation.

343
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,080
If you want to have some type of a garden,

344
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,280
we had considered having a garden this year,

345
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,960
but with the time by which

346
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
we were finally able to move into the house

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
and all of those things,

348
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,880
we did not really have time to prepare the soil.

349
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
And if you don't have time to prepare the soil,

350
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
it does you no good to just go throw some seeds.

351
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,120
That soil must be cultivated.

352
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,640
That soil must be prepared.

353
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,240
And you go through that process

354
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,960
and you cultivate and you prepare

355
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
and you get it ready so that you can plant the seed

356
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,880
so that in time you can have a harvest.

357
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,640
If you go out here and just throw out some seed

358
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,880
without cultivating the ground,

359
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,000
you're probably not going to have much of a harvest.

360
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,040
You see, if you live in areas not much around here,

361
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,080
but if you travel a little bit west of here

362
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,640
and where we lived in Pennsylvania for a number of years,

363
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,840
close to Lancaster County and the Amish folks,

364
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,960
you can travel through those parts of the country,

365
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
many parts around our nation

366
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,400
where you can travel for miles and miles

367
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,240
and you can see farmlands

368
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,560
and you can see how that in that springtime,

369
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,480
the owners, the operators,

370
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,120
they're out there working to cultivate and to prepare.

371
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,960
Why?

372
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
Because they want to have a harvest.

373
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
They want to have a harvest.

374
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Notice what the Bible says.

375
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,280
Turn to the book of Hosea, if you will.

376
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,680
The book of Hosea,

377
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,360
right after the book of Daniel, Hosea chapter number 10,

378
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Hosea chapter number 10.

379
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,680
I've heard several preachers

380
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,040
when they go to a minor prophet,

381
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,640
say it's after Genesis and before Revelation.

382
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,920
I've often thought that's not very helpful.

383
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
And so Hosea, just after the book of Daniel,

384
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Hosea chapter number 10,

385
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,320
notice what the Bible says here in verse number 12.

386
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,280
Hosea 10 and verse number 12,

387
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,120
the Bible says this,

388
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
sow to yourselves in righteousness,

389
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,640
reap in mercy.

390
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,880
Notice what it says,

391
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,600
break up your fallow ground

392
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
for it is time to seek the Lord

393
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,520
till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

394
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
Notice what he says of these.

395
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
He's indicting the nation of Israel

396
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,600
because of their spiritual wickedness

397
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,520
and their spiritual idolatry,

398
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,240
adultery, as he'd refer to it as.

399
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,800
In verse 13, you have plowed wickedness,

400
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,840
you have reaped iniquity.

401
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,480
You have eaten the fruit of lies

402
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,440
because thou didst trust in thy way

403
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,080
in the multitude of thy mighty men.

404
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,840
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people

405
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,480
and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled

406
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,800
as Shalman spoiled Beth Arbel in the day of battle.

407
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,960
The mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.

408
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
And we find that this truth in verse number 12,

409
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,560
break up your fallow ground.

410
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,880
Break up your fallow ground.

411
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,400
That process of cultivation,

412
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,280
decide this morning,

413
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,680
when we think about this idea of being revival ready,

414
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,080
that we're gonna decide

415
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
that we're going to agree with God.

416
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,440
We're just gonna agree with God.

417
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,240
We're gonna say God knows best.

418
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,000
He's the creator and sustainer.

419
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,480
He knows best and so I wanna get into this book

420
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,200
and I wanna agree with what God says.

421
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,400
It's not about what is popular today.

422
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,080
It's not about what some person wrote.

423
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,060
It's not about what some person thinks.

424
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,800
It's not that I'm the authority or you're the authority.

425
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,840
It's that God is the authority.

426
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,520
And we say that as we desire to be ready for revival

427
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,920
that we need to have this process

428
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,240
of cultivating our hearts

429
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
so that our hearts would be prepared

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
as you would prepare that soil

431
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,720
and I'm going to agree with God.

432
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,880
There are times in which I may preach from this pulpit.

433
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,860
I may counsel from my office or from my phone

434
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,520
as I would talk to individuals

435
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
and there are times in which

436
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
as I would enter into meetings such as that

437
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,800
that I would begin with saying something on this light

438
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,120
of can we agree that we'll agree with God?

439
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,120
Because if we can't agree that we're gonna agree with God

440
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,880
then we're gonna have some difficulties.

441
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,400
And so let's just go to the authority, the word of God

442
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,840
and say we're gonna agree with God.

443
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
Last week I preached a message on how to have a home

444
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,560
that honors the Lord.

445
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,660
And I started that message by talking about the fact

446
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,240
that this is God's word and we're gonna agree with God.

447
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Society is not gonna tell you how to have a home

448
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,840
that honors God, but God's word will.

449
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,160
Amen?

450
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,559
And we come to that place where no longer am I resisting

451
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,559
what God says, how God is working in my heart, my life.

452
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm not resisting, but no, I'm submitting to his word.

453
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,299
I have a heart that is prepared.

454
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,280
You'll be mindful of the truth in Matthew chapter number 13

455
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,480
the parable that is given with regard to the sower

456
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,119
and to the seed.

457
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,059
We will not have time to go through the entirety

458
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,640
of the parable this morning,

459
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,160
but if you look in Matthew chapter number 13

460
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,559
you find that the parable is given

461
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,200
and he speaks about the seed that is sown

462
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,679
and how some falls by the wayside

463
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,799
and some upon stony places and some among the thorns,

464
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,239
but some fell upon good ground.

465
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:26,239
You pick that up in verse number eight of Matthew 13

466
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,600
and you find in verse number eight that the Bible says,

467
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,600
but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit.

468
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,119
Some, and hundred fold, some 60, some 30 fold.

469
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,160
We think about the word of God as being the seed

470
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,880
that is mentioned here in this particular parable.

471
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
And I believe that, listen,

472
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,280
the word of God is going to be preached.

473
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,500
The seed is going to be given.

474
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,820
But will our hearts, will the soil be ready to receive it?

475
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,940
You find that he says,

476
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,740
into good ground in verse number eight, and as the explanation is provided in verse number 23,

477
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:14,180
you find the Bible says, but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word

478
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,420
and understandeth it, which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some and hundredfold some sixty,

479
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,900
some thirty. I think about this truth of receiving the word of God. The church in Thessalonica is

480
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:34,100
commended because they receive the word of God as it is in truth. Not the word of men, but the word

481
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:41,300
of God, and they are commended for that. We find that James says that we're to be doers of the word

482
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,580
and not hearers only. Jesus, as he would give the account of the wise man and the foolish man,

483
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,100
he would make that comparison. He says this, and we sing the song with the kids about the rich man

484
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,060
built his house upon the rock and so on and so forth, but when you look at the account and the

485
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:07,060
word of God, you find that they both heard the same message. It was the response of the mess,

486
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:13,700
or to the message, that determined whether they were likened to a wise man or a foolish man.

487
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,700
The message was the same, and it was from the Lord.

488
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:27,139
But the one that received it and did it was a doer of the word. Jesus says, I will liken him

489
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:34,500
unto a wise man. That wise man, he built his house upon a rock, and the rains came, the floods came,

490
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:42,740
and it stood. Listen, we're going to deal with storms in our lives, but if we've built our house

491
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:47,380
upon the truth of our lives, upon the truth of God's word,

492
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,700
with God's help, we can weather those storms of life.

493
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:01,700
The other man, he says that he heard the same message, but he did not do, he did not understand

494
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:10,020
and apply, and the Lord says, I will liken him unto a foolish man. What happened to that foolish

495
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:17,779
man? It was the same thing. He dealt with storms, right? The rains came, the waters rose, and the

496
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:31,699
house, it did not stand, it fell. This morning, next week, we hear the word of God. The seed of

497
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:39,779
God's word is being given. Is our heart ready to receive it? That process of cultivation. See,

498
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:46,100
after I have that process of contemplation, and it leads me to a place of confession,

499
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,660
and then it leads me to a place of cultivation, where now my heart, I'm preparing, I'm seeking

500
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:59,059
God, and I'm desiring that he would help me to have a heart that is ready to receive. I'm anxiously

501
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:04,820
anticipating what is it that God's going to show me today from his word. As I open the scriptures

502
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,940
in the morning from my own personal devotions, I'm entering with a level of excitement of what

503
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:18,260
is God going to show me today? How is God going to lead me today? Because my heart's been prepared,

504
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:26,580
and it's that good soil that's ready to receive, and ready to produce fruits unto righteousness.

505
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:33,380
Number four, not only do we have contemplation, confession, cultivation,

506
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:42,180
but I would say this, communion. Communion. That we would have sweet communion, fellowship with

507
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:51,139
our God. That we would, on a daily basis, walk so closely to God, and have such sweet communion

508
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:57,059
with God, that we're just revival ready. I mean, we're really already experiencing revival.

509
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,500
I believe if you follow this process, that really revival will be the result.

510
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:10,100
Or having that sweet communion with the Lord. The songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul

511
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:17,300
and the Savior. You think about that. You ever have a relationship in life where there's something

512
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,700
between you and the other person that you're in a relationship with, and that something, whatever

513
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:29,220
it is, is hindering your fellowship. It's caused, sometimes we use the word, a wedge in a relationship,

514
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:34,100
and the fellowship isn't what it should be. Why? Because there's something between you and

515
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:40,820
that person. The songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. I hope this morning

516
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,260
that we could say that. That after we go through the process of contemplation and confession,

517
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:56,339
then we can say, Lord, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. I'm not perfect, but there's

518
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:02,179
nothing that I'm aware of that you've shown me that I have refused to confess, that I'm seeking

519
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:12,420
to cover up. No, I've asked you to create in me a clean heart. This idea of communion, I understand

520
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,019
this morning that there are times that the busyness of our schedules would sometimes hinder

521
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:28,260
us from having the communion with God that we really need to have. And I wonder if this week

522
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:39,779
we could purpose to eliminate something from our daily, weekly routine that we might be able to

523
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:49,140
have some extended time of communion with God. You think about the truth in Matthew 5,

524
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,459
blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. You think about Psalm 42,

525
00:35:53,459 --> 00:36:00,179
as the heart panteth after the water broke, so panteth my heart after thee, O God. That I just

526
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:06,179
want to be in His presence. I just want to have communion with Him. I just can't wait to

527
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:13,140
have that time and I want to purposefully maybe remove something. You say, I have nothing that

528
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:20,660
I can remove from my schedule. I understand what it is to be busy, but I wonder this morning,

529
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,619
could we remove some news from our schedule?

530
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,420
Sometimes people watch the news and man, it seems like time just kind of,

531
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:38,899
I don't have social media personally, but Facebook, Instagram, I don't even know what they're all

532
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:46,179
called. TikTok, Snapchat, I don't know what they even, I don't know what all of them are.

533
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:52,739
But you know, those are time wasters. Maybe we make a decision, you know what,

534
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:58,339
I'm going to take a siesta, I don't know where that came from, amen. Maybe I need a nap this

535
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:03,380
afternoon. Amen, I don't know. I'm going to take and I'm going to have a time where I'm going to

536
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:14,100
separate myself from this instant messenger, social media stuff. I'm going to step back and

537
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,059
take a sabbatical, if you will, from that. Why? So that I can have extra time with God.

538
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,619
And on a purpose to do that, so I can have that communion. Listen, I don't believe this morning

539
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:31,299
that you'd ever regret that. You know what I think would happen is that we'd find that we

540
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:36,260
really don't need that other stuff as much as we thought we did. It doesn't really matter that

541
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,420
someone said, hey, did you see that post on, hey, did you know about this? And I was reading my

542
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:47,540
Bible. God was ministering to my heart, right? I was being helped. You know, there's a word in the

543
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,339
Psalms. In fact, we read it just a little while ago as we were reading the Psalms and there's a

544
00:37:52,339 --> 00:38:00,500
word that you often come to and it's the word Selah. It's a word that oftentimes in our 21st

545
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,140
century Christianity, we really don't spend a whole lot of time on the word because we really

546
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:14,980
don't have time for it. Because Selah means stop, meditate, let it sink in,

547
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:24,339
kind of hit replay, if you will, and just let the truth of that particular Psalm. We read it in Psalm

548
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:33,540
32 about acknowledging my sin and not hiding it, confessing it, and having forgiveness. And the

549
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:42,979
Psalmist says Selah. Oh man, park there. Just let it sink in and let it impact you and affect you.

550
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,940
But there are times in which the busyness does not allow for that type of meditation,

551
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:55,220
the prayer and the Bible reading. See, the layout of 2 Chronicles 7 and verse number 14,

552
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,099
if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face.

553
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,659
Pray and seek my face. That's the communion that we're dealing with here in our fourth point.

554
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,780
And I believe this morning that if we're going to be revival ready that there are some steps that

555
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:18,419
we need to take. If you ask somebody, are you ready? It demands context. Ready for what?

556
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,619
I remember when I played baseball.

557
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,859
Are you ready to play? Man, if you had to go find your glove when the coach was ready to

558
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:39,940
put you in, you were not ready. You're prepared. When I played football, well, run in this play.

559
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,539
What are we supposed to do on that play? You're not ready. When it comes to revival,

560
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,380
you're not going to be ready on accident. We're not going to just show up next Sunday and be like,

561
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:58,979
man, I'm here. Let's have revival. I don't want it to just be another event on the calendar.

562
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,940
We don't schedule these things just so that we can say.

563
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:09,460
say, we have a revival meeting on our calendar. Meet status quo of Baptist churches. No, no.

564
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:19,020
I want God to work. And I desire for me personally, and I hope that you would desire for you personally

565
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,560
that you'd be ready for revival. That it would not be a situation where the preaching next

566
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,960
week has to be the breaking up the fallow ground and getting all the soil prepared and

567
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:38,960
then all of a sudden the evangelist is gone. But no, we personally would be ready for revival.

568
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,820
That we will take, again, it's not an exhaustive list. You may have other things already that

569
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:51,820
you've thought of. But if we begin with some contemplation, it takes time. Self-examination

570
00:40:51,820 --> 00:41:02,180
takes time. Calling out to God and saying, God, search me. Show me. Lead me. That contemplation

571
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:12,880
will lead to confession. Confession is a good thing. To be clean. Not cleaner, but clean.

572
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,160
That we could say, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. Oh man, that's wonderful.

573
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,459
Then we cultivate that soil of our heart. We prepare our hearts. I believe at that point

574
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:32,639
we're already having revival. We have that communion with God. Praying and seeking His

575
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:39,160
face and reading His Word. Meditating upon the truths that are contained therein. Saying,

576
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:47,120
God, speak to me. I preached a message back in August. Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

577
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,400
Every day when I read the Bible, I pray Psalm 119, open thou mine eyes that I may behold

578
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,240
wondrous things out of thy law. Since I preached that message in August, I can't say every

579
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,000
day, but almost every day, I've said, open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous

580
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,840
things out of thy law. Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. I want God to speak to my

581
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:14,240
heart. I'm going to do a work. And so this morning, you want to be revival ready? See

582
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:22,240
God move and work and have that sweet communion that is beyond anything this world could ever

583
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,880
offer. So that's what I want. Maybe this week we can incorporate some of these things. I

584
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,479
tell you this morning, listen, the enemy's going to try to get you busy. He's going to

585
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:36,360
try to have you have a week this week that's more busy than any week you've had in the

586
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:44,320
last six months. Why? Because revival's coming. Because we've got special meetings. That's

587
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:50,160
the way the enemy works. Just letting you know. That's how he works. That's the way

588
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,880
they have to do. We've got to protect. We've got to prepare. We've got to say, no, I want

589
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,400
to be revival ready. Oh, that God would help us to be a people that experience revival.

590
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,600
The psalmist said, will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee?

591
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,199
Come back tonight when the joy is withered away. Oh, I hope it'll be a blessing to you.

592
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,680
Because revival, the result is that rejoicing in thee, the outworking of that joy. David

593
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,400
said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. In that same Psalm 51 that we looked at a

594
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,400
little bit this morning. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

595
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:39,639
thank you for your Word. I pray that somehow this morning you've taken some truth, some

596
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,880
verse, many verses, and you've used them in the hearts and lives of these that are gathered

597
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,800
this morning. Personally, individually, I desire to be ready for revival. As the pastor,

598
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I desire for our church, the folks that you've gathered, assembled here to be ready for revival.

599
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:13,400
But the reality is that I can't make anyone else ready for revival. And there's not one

600
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,399
in this sanctuary that can make anyone else ready for revival. But individually, as we

601
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,320
allow you to work in our hearts and lives, we come to that place where we say, I want

602
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,320
to be ready for revival. God, would you help us to incorporate, implement these four principles

603
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,600
or thoughts into our lives this week. Help it to not just be this week, but to be regular

604
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,640
in our lives that we would contemplate, confess, cultivate, and have sweet communion with you.

605
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:56,799
That we'd have revival. If there's one that's present that's not sure of heaven, I pray

606
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,880
that today would be the day of their salvation. I pray for each believer, God, that you'd

607
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:10,880
stir us, but change us. Well, thank you. Give you the praise and glory for all that

608
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,200
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

609
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,040
eyes are closed. Holly's going to play quietly on the piano. We're going to give you an opportunity

610
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,000
to respond. Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar and ask the Lord to help

611
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,720
you in one or all of these areas that we dealt with this morning. Maybe you want to make

612
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,320
your pew in altar. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how

613
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,640
you can know for sure that heaven's your home. As Holly plays, the altar is open.
