WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
us this evening either, and our revival meeting starts next week, and so I'm going to preach

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.840
a couple of messages today on really preparation for revival, if you will, and on Wednesday

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.239
evening for our prayer and Bible study, I'll share a short thought with you with regard

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.239
to revival, and we'll spend an extended period of time in prayer.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:22.440
I mentioned this last Wednesday evening that if you study revival historically, you will

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.159
find that in every movement of God, of revival, it's always preceded by prayer, always.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:40.200
And it's amazing how that God has just designed it to be so that He uses prayer, and it's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.580
what a privilege of ours as His people to go to Him in prayer, and it moves the hand

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.599
of God, and it's such an amazing privilege.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.779
Psalm 85, as you have your place there, I want you to also take and turn to 2 Chronicles

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:58.299
chapter number 7 and hold your place in 2 Chronicles 7 and verse number 14.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.740
I'm really not going to deal much with that particular verse of Scripture this morning,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.779
though it's probably one of the most familiar verses when you start talking about revival.

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:13.099
And as I go through the message this morning, I will make some reference back to 2 Chronicles

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:17.980
7 and verse number 14, so I want you to have your place there, if you will.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.260
And here in the Psalms, in Psalm 85 and verse number 6, the psalmist says this,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:34.019
"'Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?'

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:36.139
That thy people may rejoice in thee."

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.500
I'm going to be preaching from Joel this evening and dealing with the subject of when the joy

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.599
is withered away.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.720
And here in Psalm 85 and verse number 6, the psalmist says, "'Wilt thou not revive us

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.639
again, notice that thy people may rejoice in thee?'

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.319
Rejoicing is the outworking of joy.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.879
When the joy is withered away, we're not rejoicing."

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.120
And that's tonight's message, so you want a preview, there it is.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.000
Come back tonight, we'll deal with the entirety of the message.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.119
But we find here that the psalmist is crying out for this revival that only can be sent

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.119
by God.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.399
Solomon, as he's dedicating the temple as the context of 2 Chronicles chapter number

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:21.639
7, and you read the prayer in chapter number 6 and all that is going on with the sacrifices

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.399
as you enter into the seventh chapter of the book of 2 Chronicles, and you find that God

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:32.399
then speaks to Solomon in response to the prayer that Solomon has offered as a dedication

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:33.399
of the temple.

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:39.360
And God says this in verse number 14, "'If my people, which are called by my name, shall

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.720
humble themselves and pray and seek my face,' and then it says this, "'and turn from their

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.639
wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.639
land.'"

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.759
This morning, as you see in the bulletin, I want to preach a message that I've simply

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.839
entitled, How to be Revival Ready.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.559
How to be Revival Ready.

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.520
Have you ever been asked the question, are you ready?

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.720
That question necessitates context, does it not?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.399
Am I ready for what?

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.039
You don't just say to somebody, hey, are you ready?

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.440
What's the context if I'm ready?

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.559
Some of us fellas, we ask our wives occasionally, are you ready?

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.039
Now that could be a dangerous question.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:26.240
And we're trying to find out if they're prepared, are they ready for leaving?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.639
The word ready carries with it the idea of being prepared, fitted, furnished with that

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:39.160
which is necessary, disposed in a manner suited to the purpose, the idea a ship that

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.000
is ready for sea.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.559
I like this definition of the word ready, in a state of preparation so as to need no

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.839
delay.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.940
We think about this subject of being revival ready, I'm mindful, and I won't be dealing

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.600
with the context of this this morning, but if you are mindful of the account that's given

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.960
to us in Matthew 25 of the ten virgins, and the context of that portion of Scripture there

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.520
in Matthew chapter number 25, when the bridegroom came, you will be mindful of the fact that

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.279
there were five that were ready.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.239
But there were five that were not ready.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.480
They were not in a state of preparation as to need no delay, no, they were running around

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.640
trying to look for oil for their lamps, right?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.019
They were not ready, they were not prepared.

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:37.140
As we embark on having this revival meeting, and it will begin next Sunday, Pastor Mike

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.980
Edwards will be with us, but you understand this morning that revival does not happen

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.739
just because you put something on the calendar.

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:49.980
Just because you invite a guest speaker, just because you have some extra services throughout

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.579
the week, does not mean that the result is going to actually be revival.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:00.660
I would say this, revival is not going to happen.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.980
You are, let me put it this way, we are not as a church going to be revival ready by accident.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.019
We think about this subject of how to be revival ready, I will admit at the onset of the message

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:16.220
this morning that this is not an exhaustive list.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.380
Perhaps as you would just review and meditate upon the thoughts from this morning, perhaps

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:28.619
you will add additional things to the list of how you personally can be revival ready,

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:33.579
but I want to just share with you four thoughts this morning that I believe would be impactful

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:39.500
and helpful for us that would enable us to be in a place where we are revival ready.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.459
This morning we no doubt had some various things that took place in our attempt to come

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:50.980
to church this morning, and I hope that when we get to church that we're ready for church.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.299
We come expecting and anticipating that God's going to work, and as we sing the songs and

00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:01.899
as we have the opportunity to worship through song, that our hearts are being prepared,

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:07.540
our hearts are being ready to receive the message from God's Word.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.619
And so this morning, as we think about this how to be revival ready, number one if you're

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:16.579
taking notes, I believe it starts with contemplation, contemplation.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:22.820
The idea of the word contemplation is the act of the mind in considering with attention.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.779
I believe that as we would think about that definition of contemplation, that we'd understand

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.500
that there is an object of our contemplation.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.660
We see that it's the act of the mind in considering with attention.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.579
We're not talking about contemplating the stars or contemplating some other object.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:44.019
We're speaking this morning on how to be revival ready, to be in the place where the psalmist

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:47.420
says, will thou not revive us again?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.000
Are we ready for revival?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.140
Are we longing for revival?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.660
And we find that it will begin with this contemplation, and the object of our contemplation is our

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.940
lives.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.660
It's a process of examination, really, which we'll come to as we begin to put our lives,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.940
if you will, under the microscope that we're considering with attention, that we're asking

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.140
ourselves the questions with regard to our behavior being pleasing in the eyes of the

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.140
Lord.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.100
Ephesians chapter number 5 and verse number 10, the Bible says, proving what is acceptable

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.420
in the sight of the Lord.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.220
That word proving would often be used within those that worked with metals, and it would

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.700
be that proving process that they would go through, and what a process that is.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.540
In fact, the refinement of metals is often referenced throughout the Word of God.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.980
As silver is tried, you'll see that referenced many times, not only with regard to the Bible

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:51.299
itself, but in us being refined as people, and God taking us through that refining fire.

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:57.100
That process in which we're going to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we're

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.519
going to examine our lives.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.779
You know, we have the Lord's Supper table in front of me this morning, just due in remembrance

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:04.779
of me.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:09.179
I'm so thankful of the truth of 1 Corinthians chapter number 11, and what a blessing.

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:14.260
I'm so thankful that God gave us the ordinance of the Lord's Supper so that we could remember

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.339
His death until He come.

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:21.140
It gives us that remembrance of what He did for us, the awful price that was paid for

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.700
our sin, but it also gives us that excitement of that expectation that soon He's going to

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.019
come.

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:35.700
But in verse number 28 of 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible says, but let a man examine himself.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.820
But let a man examine himself.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.859
And we think about that process of self-examination, honestly it's something that at times we'd

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:44.380
rather not engage in.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.580
It's at times that we would rather not go through the process of self-examination.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.460
But the reality is that it is good for us as the people of God to go through that process,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.099
to contemplate, to consider with attention our lives and how does our behavior align

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:03.099
with the Word of God.

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:08.140
And as we begin to contemplate, as we begin to examine, I think about the church there

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.020
that is mentioned in the book of Revelation in the third chapter, the church of the Laodiceans.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.260
Remember, they had an opinion about themselves that varied greatly from what God said about

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.260
them.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.500
They were increased with goods and had need of nothing, but God said that they were poor,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.059
miserable, and naked.

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:31.780
Their view was quite different than what God's assessment was.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.780
Their assessment and God's assessment were not aligned one with the other.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.539
And this morning I believe that as we think about this matter of contemplation and we

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:46.659
consider it in light of Ephesians 5 and 1 Corinthians 11, that I believe it takes us

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:54.340
to a place where we will say as the psalmist did in Psalm 139, search me, O God.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.539
Turn over there if you will to Psalm 139, you're in Psalm 85, so just turn several pages

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:00.059
over to Psalm 139.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:06.419
on 139, and we find that the psalmist ends this particular chapter with this

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:11.499
wonderful declaration and really a prayer. And I believe this morning that

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:16.799
if we've not gone through the process of self-examination, that most likely we're

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:22.039
not going to come to the place where the psalmist is, that we say, Lord, search me.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:27.059
We better go through a process of self-examination. You think about kids.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:31.799
Did you clean your room? And mom's gonna come and inspect. You think about an

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.779
inspection. I know that at times when I worked in the corporate world, we'd have

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:41.579
audits, and everyone was always excited to see the auditors come. Not really, right?

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:45.219
If you work in the corporate world, you know when the auditors come. It is not

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:49.219
going to be a good day, week, however long they're gonna be there for. You want them

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:54.219
to leave before they arrive. That kind of a situation. And why? Because those

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:59.979
auditors are gonna dig in, and they're going to examine, they're going to

00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:05.399
inspect, they're going to dig in to whatever the the systems are that you

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:10.939
have to ensure that things have been done according to the proper procedures.

00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:14.619
You don't have to worry about the auditors coming if you've done things

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:19.939
right. The auditors don't have to be your enemy if you've done things right, and if

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:24.339
you've gone through and you've checked your own processes and ensured that

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:27.339
things are done in an appropriate manner, you don't have to fear the

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:31.659
auditors. And this morning, if we've not gone through the process of

00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:35.739
self-examination, I doubt very highly that we would stand with the psalmist

00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:44.379
and say, search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. Notice

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:51.619
verse 24, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:57.339
everlasting. When I think about this first step that I've dealt with this

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:02.779
morning, this step of contemplation, and I think about the the way in which we

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:06.419
looked at 2 Chronicles chapter number 7 this morning, I believe that the

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:13.940
process of contemplation will humble us. I believe it will humble us. See, sometimes

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.099
we think too highly of ourselves. We think we got it all together. We forget

00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:24.539
that we're sinners saved by grace. Amen? We forget that, as Paul said, I'm the

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:29.220
chief of sinners, but Christ saved me. I am what I am by the grace of God. And

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.259
sometimes we can feel like we've got everything together, and we just kind of

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:37.979
are doing it, and we're on the right path and doing everything within our power,

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:42.979
but I believe that as we really get into this process of contemplation, this

00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:49.179
self-examination, that it'll have a way of humbling us. We ask God to search us and

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:52.940
show us, and then all of a sudden, God does a more thorough job than we do,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.739
because we can deceive ourselves. Amen? And we find that God does a more thorough

00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:02.660
job, and God will touch this area, and He'll touch this area, and He'll remind

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.059
us of this thing, and oh, this is a good process for us. It's appropriate

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:14.819
for us as the people of God. I believe it will bring humility. If my people,

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:21.179
which are called by my name, shall humble themselves. Humility. Someone said this,

00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:26.099
that the greatest sin in the church house today is pride. There's probably

00:13:26.099 --> 00:13:31.779
some validity to that statement. Oh, that God would humble us. I believe that if we

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:36.059
go through this process of contemplation, I believe that the humility will come.

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:43.459
Number two, after the contemplation, I believe there will come confession.

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:51.059
Confession. This, I believe, is the natural response to contemplation. I read

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:55.220
recently about someone that was asked what their greatest mistake was, and they

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:01.099
said, well, I can't really think of one. I hope that we would honestly evaluate and

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:05.419
go through a process of contemplation that will humble us, that will bring us

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:10.300
to a place of confession. See, there's not one amongst us that's reached a place

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.300
of sinless perfection. You know why? Because we're all still here. When you

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.579
get to heaven, then you've reached a place where there's not going to be any

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:24.899
more sin. Amen? Aren't you thankful for that? But until that day, we still have

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:30.660
this flesh, and there is still sin in our lives that needs to be dealt with, and as

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.139
we go through that process of contemplation, it leads us to that point

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.179
of confession. I want you to notice, we'll stick here with a couple of passages in

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:43.419
the book of Psalms. Turn back to Psalm 32, if you will, and look in Psalm 32, and

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:49.100
notice what the psalmist says here in this passage of Scripture. And I love how

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.859
he begins the Psalm, because for sure it is a wonderful thing to

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:59.419
be forgiven, to know that our sins are forgiven. I would say, as we look at this

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:02.779
verse of Scripture, in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:09.980
"...blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered." It's not

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.019
the idea of covering it, as in hiding it from God. It's the idea of we've been

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:20.940
forgiven by God. It's covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, and what

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.419
a blessing to know that we have been forgiven. Notice what the psalmist says

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:34.260
in verse number five, "...I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:42.139
not hid." I acknowledged it. I've not hid it. I said, I will confess my transgressions

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:50.619
unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. Aren't you

00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:55.100
thankful for forgiveness? Forgiveness is the promise that God has given us with

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.139
response to our confession. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:04.459
just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, 1 John 1 and

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:09.100
verse number 9. And so we think about this subject of confession, and the

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.500
psalmist says, I acknowledged my sin, mine iniquity have I not hid. I've asked the

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.579
question before from this pulpit, but I believe it's worth repeating this

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:24.100
morning. Is God that is omniscient, does He know about your sin? Sure He does.

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:30.339
Did He know about the sin of Adam and Eve in the garden? Sure He did. When He

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:34.139
came walking, He already knew what they had done. He already knew that they had

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:38.820
taken of that which they were not to partake of, and they hid themselves. Why

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.859
did they hide themselves? Because they were shameful. They were ashamed of what

00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:46.619
had happened. They not only hid themselves, but they tried to cover their

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:52.419
nakedness with those fig leaves because their eyes had been opened. God knows

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:57.579
about your sin. He knows about my sin. So who do we think we are that we're gonna

00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:03.100
hide it from God? It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, does it? It makes

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.380
sense that we would say, as the psalmist does here in verse number 5, I

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.299
acknowledged my sin unto thee, mine iniquity have I not hid, because He knows

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:18.260
about it. And so therefore, I'm going to confess it to Him. I'm not gonna try to

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.380
hide it from Him. You ever have a situation where the little kid takes

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.899
something, the cookie he's not supposed to take, Joseph, last night, throw him right

00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:32.779
under the bus, right? And Brianna's sitting in the other room and she says,

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:37.139
did he just eat a cookie off of that tray? Those were not to be eaten. I said,

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:41.380
get him. You know how the older sister is, right? And I don't think he

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.339
tried to hide it. It was like, yeah, actually I had two of them. But the

00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:52.019
reality is, sometimes the kid tries to hide it, right? You see the cookie crumbs,

00:17:52.019 --> 00:18:00.100
the chocolate in the corner of the mouth. Joel, did you have a cookie? No, I don't

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.019
know what you're talking about, mom. You had a cookie all over your face. See, God knows,

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:11.619
right? Why would we try to hide it? It doesn't make any sense. He says, I will

00:18:11.619 --> 00:18:15.220
confess my transgressions unto the Lord. Listen, you don't have to confess

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.820
them to any man. There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:33.419
He is our advocate. And we go to God, we say, Lord, would you forgive me? I'm gonna

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:39.539
confess. I'm gonna say the same thing about my sin that your Word says. I'm not

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:43.739
gonna try to cover it. I'm not gonna seek to excuse it. No, I'm gonna call it what

00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:48.260
it is. And notice in Psalm 51, notice what David says. What a wonderful psalm. I was

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.659
actually gonna preach through this whole psalm this morning, and God led me in a

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:56.460
different direction. But I meditated much upon this psalm this past week, and I

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.059
would encourage you to do the same. But I want you to notice, this is the psalm of

00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.260
David's repentance, and it says in verse number three of Psalm 51, for I

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:09.419
acknowledge my transgressions, my sin is ever before me. Notice what he says in

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:16.179
verse number four, against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy

00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:21.619
sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:26.380
thou judgest. Look down, if you will, at verse number seven. The Bible says, purge

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:33.260
me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:43.099
Verse 10, create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew in me a right, excuse me, renew a

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:50.979
right spirit within me. Oh, that desire to be clean. Not to simply be a little

00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:57.340
cleaner, but to be clean. That God, as we go to Him in prayer, and we confess our

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.140
sin, after we've gone through that process of

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.880
of contemplation where we have

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.000
the act of the mind considering

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.660
with attention our lives

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.080
and doing that self-examination

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.680
and going through that process,

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.280
and it brings us that level of humility

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.980
that I then confess

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.480
against Thee and Thee only.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.480
I acknowledge my sin, my transgression.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.280
God, would You create in me a clean heart?

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.880
Proverbs 28 and verse number 13.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.100
Very similar to what we've read earlier

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.380
in Psalm 32.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.580
But it goes and gives us a further principle

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.780
if you will, where the Bible says this

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.020
in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13,

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.020
He that covereth his sins

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.300
shall not prosper.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.860
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:02.660
not the sins shall have mercy.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.300
This verse reveals to me that it is possible

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:11.120
for each one of us to try to cover our sins.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.020
Because the Bible says he that covereth his sins

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.060
shall not prosper.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.940
We try to cover up.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.900
We try to make it so no one else knows about it.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.700
But God knows about it.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.760
And can I tell you this?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.080
God's definition of prosperity

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.260
is quite different than the world's definition

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.000
of prosperity.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.120
There are times in which we have

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.480
falsely believed that God may be okay

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.020
with our behavior because God

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.840
is being long-suffering to us.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.520
There are times in which we've maybe

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.520
been blinded to think that God is okay

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.400
with our behavior because we,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.480
by the world's standards,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.240
never had some measure of success or prosperity.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.720
The Bible tells us in His presence

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.200
is fullness of joy.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.920
The riches that we receive from God

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.560
in His presence and that close walk with Him,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.480
that cannot be compared with what

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.000
the world would offer.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.800
I'm thankful that our God is long-suffering.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200
And I've often said over the years

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.960
that we ought never mistake

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.640
God's long-suffering for God's approval.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.400
Our God is a holy God who is never okay with sin.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.840
So we confess.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.800
We confess our sin.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.120
That reference that we made in 2 Chronicles 7

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.160
in verse number 14,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.120
it says at the end of those items

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.800
that are listed after humble themselves,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800
pray, seek My face,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.560
it says, turn from their wicked ways.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.160
That's confession.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.880
That confession comes after that contemplation.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.280
This week as we are seeking to be ready

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.800
for revival,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.560
that we would spend some time contemplating,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.200
inspecting, examining our lives,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.200
and being truthful and honest with ourselves

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.400
and with God and saying,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.880
God, search me and show me and reveal in me

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.880
those things that I need to stop doing,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.560
those things that I need to start doing.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.840
God, help me.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.160
The sins of commission,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.320
the sins of omission,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.960
help me, God, to be clean.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.440
And then we find that after the contemplation

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.080
and after the confession,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.200
I believe number three,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.000
there needs to be some cultivation.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.200
Some cultivation.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.040
The idea of preparing the soil of our hearts.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.080
I mentioned this morning

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.400
that as we entered into the house of God

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.840
that our desire should have been

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.880
that I'm coming with an attitude of anticipation

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.200
and expectation is,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.080
what does God have for me today?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.800
What is it that I can learn through a song?

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800
What is it that I can learn from another believer?

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.600
What is it that I can learn from the Word of God?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.320
What is it that I can learn today?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.640
What does God have for me?

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.960
And we come expecting to hear from God,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.120
but our hearts have to be prepared for that.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.480
There has to be that process of cultivation.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.080
If you want to have some type of a garden,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.280
we had considered having a garden this year,

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.960
but with the time by which

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.000
we were finally able to move into the house

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.040
and all of those things,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.880
we did not really have time to prepare the soil.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.920
And if you don't have time to prepare the soil,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.920
it does you no good to just go throw some seeds.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.120
That soil must be cultivated.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.640
That soil must be prepared.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.240
And you go through that process

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.960
and you cultivate and you prepare

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.960
and you get it ready so that you can plant the seed

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.880
so that in time you can have a harvest.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.640
If you go out here and just throw out some seed

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.880
without cultivating the ground,

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.000
you're probably not going to have much of a harvest.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.040
You see, if you live in areas not much around here,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.080
but if you travel a little bit west of here

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.640
and where we lived in Pennsylvania for a number of years,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.840
close to Lancaster County and the Amish folks,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.960
you can travel through those parts of the country,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.960
many parts around our nation

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.400
where you can travel for miles and miles

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.240
and you can see farmlands

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.560
and you can see how that in that springtime,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.480
the owners, the operators,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.120
they're out there working to cultivate and to prepare.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.960
Why?

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.880
Because they want to have a harvest.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.240
They want to have a harvest.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240
Notice what the Bible says.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.280
Turn to the book of Hosea, if you will.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.680
The book of Hosea,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.360
right after the book of Daniel, Hosea chapter number 10,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.440
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Hosea chapter number 10.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.680
I've heard several preachers

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.040
when they go to a minor prophet,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.640
say it's after Genesis and before Revelation.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.920
I've often thought that's not very helpful.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.920
And so Hosea, just after the book of Daniel,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.760
Hosea chapter number 10,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.320
notice what the Bible says here in verse number 12.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.280
Hosea 10 and verse number 12,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.120
the Bible says this,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.720
sow to yourselves in righteousness,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.640
reap in mercy.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.880
Notice what it says,

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.600
break up your fallow ground

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.280
for it is time to seek the Lord

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.520
till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.120
Notice what he says of these.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.680
He's indicting the nation of Israel

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.600
because of their spiritual wickedness

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.520
and their spiritual idolatry,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.240
adultery, as he'd refer to it as.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.800
In verse 13, you have plowed wickedness,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.840
you have reaped iniquity.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.480
You have eaten the fruit of lies

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.440
because thou didst trust in thy way

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.080
in the multitude of thy mighty men.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.840
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.480
and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.800
as Shalman spoiled Beth Arbel in the day of battle.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.960
The mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.520
And we find that this truth in verse number 12,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.560
break up your fallow ground.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.880
Break up your fallow ground.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.400
That process of cultivation,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.280
decide this morning,

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.680
when we think about this idea of being revival ready,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.080
that we're gonna decide

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.080
that we're going to agree with God.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.440
We're just gonna agree with God.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.240
We're gonna say God knows best.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.000
He's the creator and sustainer.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.480
He knows best and so I wanna get into this book

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.200
and I wanna agree with what God says.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.400
It's not about what is popular today.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.080
It's not about what some person wrote.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.060
It's not about what some person thinks.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.800
It's not that I'm the authority or you're the authority.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.840
It's that God is the authority.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.520
And we say that as we desire to be ready for revival

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.920
that we need to have this process

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.240
of cultivating our hearts

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.000
so that our hearts would be prepared

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.520
as you would prepare that soil

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.720
and I'm going to agree with God.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.880
There are times in which I may preach from this pulpit.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.860
I may counsel from my office or from my phone

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.520
as I would talk to individuals

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.200
and there are times in which

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.440
as I would enter into meetings such as that

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.800
that I would begin with saying something on this light

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.120
of can we agree that we'll agree with God?

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.120
Because if we can't agree that we're gonna agree with God

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.880
then we're gonna have some difficulties.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.400
And so let's just go to the authority, the word of God

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.840
and say we're gonna agree with God.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.440
Last week I preached a message on how to have a home

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.560
that honors the Lord.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.660
And I started that message by talking about the fact

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.240
that this is God's word and we're gonna agree with God.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240
Society is not gonna tell you how to have a home

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.840
that honors God, but God's word will.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.160
Amen?

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.559
And we come to that place where no longer am I resisting

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:45.559
what God says, how God is working in my heart, my life.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.600
I'm not resisting, but no, I'm submitting to his word.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.299
I have a heart that is prepared.

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:55.280
You'll be mindful of the truth in Matthew chapter number 13

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.480
the parable that is given with regard to the sower

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:01.119
and to the seed.

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:04.059
We will not have time to go through the entirety

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:05.640
of the parable this morning,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.160
but if you look in Matthew chapter number 13

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.559
you find that the parable is given

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:13.200
and he speaks about the seed that is sown

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.679
and how some falls by the wayside

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:19.799
and some upon stony places and some among the thorns,

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:23.239
but some fell upon good ground.

00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:26.239
You pick that up in verse number eight of Matthew 13

00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:28.600
and you find in verse number eight that the Bible says,

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.600
but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit.

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:39.119
Some, and hundred fold, some 60, some 30 fold.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.160
We think about the word of God as being the seed

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.880
that is mentioned here in this particular parable.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.640
And I believe that, listen,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.280
the word of God is going to be preached.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.500
The seed is going to be given.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.820
But will our hearts, will the soil be ready to receive it?

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.940
You find that he says,

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.740
into good ground in verse number eight, and as the explanation is provided in verse number 23,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:14.180
you find the Bible says, but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:20.420
and understandeth it, which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some and hundredfold some sixty,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.900
some thirty. I think about this truth of receiving the word of God. The church in Thessalonica is

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:34.100
commended because they receive the word of God as it is in truth. Not the word of men, but the word

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:41.300
of God, and they are commended for that. We find that James says that we're to be doers of the word

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:48.580
and not hearers only. Jesus, as he would give the account of the wise man and the foolish man,

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:54.100
he would make that comparison. He says this, and we sing the song with the kids about the rich man

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.060
built his house upon the rock and so on and so forth, but when you look at the account and the

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:07.060
word of God, you find that they both heard the same message. It was the response of the mess,

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:13.700
or to the message, that determined whether they were likened to a wise man or a foolish man.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.700
The message was the same, and it was from the Lord.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:27.139
But the one that received it and did it was a doer of the word. Jesus says, I will liken him

00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:34.500
unto a wise man. That wise man, he built his house upon a rock, and the rains came, the floods came,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:42.740
and it stood. Listen, we're going to deal with storms in our lives, but if we've built our house

00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:47.380
upon the truth of our lives, upon the truth of God's word,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.700
with God's help, we can weather those storms of life.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:01.700
The other man, he says that he heard the same message, but he did not do, he did not understand

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:10.020
and apply, and the Lord says, I will liken him unto a foolish man. What happened to that foolish

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:17.779
man? It was the same thing. He dealt with storms, right? The rains came, the waters rose, and the

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:31.699
house, it did not stand, it fell. This morning, next week, we hear the word of God. The seed of

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:39.779
God's word is being given. Is our heart ready to receive it? That process of cultivation. See,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:46.100
after I have that process of contemplation, and it leads me to a place of confession,

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:52.660
and then it leads me to a place of cultivation, where now my heart, I'm preparing, I'm seeking

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:59.059
God, and I'm desiring that he would help me to have a heart that is ready to receive. I'm anxiously

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:04.820
anticipating what is it that God's going to show me today from his word. As I open the scriptures

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.940
in the morning from my own personal devotions, I'm entering with a level of excitement of what

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:18.260
is God going to show me today? How is God going to lead me today? Because my heart's been prepared,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:26.580
and it's that good soil that's ready to receive, and ready to produce fruits unto righteousness.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:33.380
Number four, not only do we have contemplation, confession, cultivation,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:42.180
but I would say this, communion. Communion. That we would have sweet communion, fellowship with

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:51.139
our God. That we would, on a daily basis, walk so closely to God, and have such sweet communion

00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:57.059
with God, that we're just revival ready. I mean, we're really already experiencing revival.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:02.500
I believe if you follow this process, that really revival will be the result.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:10.100
Or having that sweet communion with the Lord. The songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul

00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:17.300
and the Savior. You think about that. You ever have a relationship in life where there's something

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.700
between you and the other person that you're in a relationship with, and that something, whatever

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:29.220
it is, is hindering your fellowship. It's caused, sometimes we use the word, a wedge in a relationship,

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:34.100
and the fellowship isn't what it should be. Why? Because there's something between you and

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:40.820
that person. The songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. I hope this morning

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:48.260
that we could say that. That after we go through the process of contemplation and confession,

00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:56.339
then we can say, Lord, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. I'm not perfect, but there's

00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:02.179
nothing that I'm aware of that you've shown me that I have refused to confess, that I'm seeking

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:12.420
to cover up. No, I've asked you to create in me a clean heart. This idea of communion, I understand

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:20.019
this morning that there are times that the busyness of our schedules would sometimes hinder

00:35:20.019 --> 00:35:28.260
us from having the communion with God that we really need to have. And I wonder if this week

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:39.779
we could purpose to eliminate something from our daily, weekly routine that we might be able to

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:49.140
have some extended time of communion with God. You think about the truth in Matthew 5,

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.459
blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. You think about Psalm 42,

00:35:53.459 --> 00:36:00.179
as the heart panteth after the water broke, so panteth my heart after thee, O God. That I just

00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:06.179
want to be in His presence. I just want to have communion with Him. I just can't wait to

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:13.140
have that time and I want to purposefully maybe remove something. You say, I have nothing that

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:20.660
I can remove from my schedule. I understand what it is to be busy, but I wonder this morning,

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:23.619
could we remove some news from our schedule?

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.420
Sometimes people watch the news and man, it seems like time just kind of,

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:38.899
I don't have social media personally, but Facebook, Instagram, I don't even know what they're all

00:36:38.899 --> 00:36:46.179
called. TikTok, Snapchat, I don't know what they even, I don't know what all of them are.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:52.739
But you know, those are time wasters. Maybe we make a decision, you know what,

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:58.339
I'm going to take a siesta, I don't know where that came from, amen. Maybe I need a nap this

00:36:58.339 --> 00:37:03.380
afternoon. Amen, I don't know. I'm going to take and I'm going to have a time where I'm going to

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:14.100
separate myself from this instant messenger, social media stuff. I'm going to step back and

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:19.059
take a sabbatical, if you will, from that. Why? So that I can have extra time with God.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.619
And on a purpose to do that, so I can have that communion. Listen, I don't believe this morning

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:31.299
that you'd ever regret that. You know what I think would happen is that we'd find that we

00:37:31.299 --> 00:37:36.260
really don't need that other stuff as much as we thought we did. It doesn't really matter that

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.420
someone said, hey, did you see that post on, hey, did you know about this? And I was reading my

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:47.540
Bible. God was ministering to my heart, right? I was being helped. You know, there's a word in the

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.339
Psalms. In fact, we read it just a little while ago as we were reading the Psalms and there's a

00:37:52.339 --> 00:38:00.500
word that you often come to and it's the word Selah. It's a word that oftentimes in our 21st

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.140
century Christianity, we really don't spend a whole lot of time on the word because we really

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:14.980
don't have time for it. Because Selah means stop, meditate, let it sink in,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:24.339
kind of hit replay, if you will, and just let the truth of that particular Psalm. We read it in Psalm

00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:33.540
32 about acknowledging my sin and not hiding it, confessing it, and having forgiveness. And the

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:42.979
Psalmist says Selah. Oh man, park there. Just let it sink in and let it impact you and affect you.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.940
But there are times in which the busyness does not allow for that type of meditation,

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:55.220
the prayer and the Bible reading. See, the layout of 2 Chronicles 7 and verse number 14,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.099
if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.659
Pray and seek my face. That's the communion that we're dealing with here in our fourth point.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:11.780
And I believe this morning that if we're going to be revival ready that there are some steps that

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:18.419
we need to take. If you ask somebody, are you ready? It demands context. Ready for what?

00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:21.619
I remember when I played baseball.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.859
Are you ready to play? Man, if you had to go find your glove when the coach was ready to

00:39:29.859 --> 00:39:39.940
put you in, you were not ready. You're prepared. When I played football, well, run in this play.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:45.539
What are we supposed to do on that play? You're not ready. When it comes to revival,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.380
you're not going to be ready on accident. We're not going to just show up next Sunday and be like,

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:58.979
man, I'm here. Let's have revival. I don't want it to just be another event on the calendar.

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:01.940
We don't schedule these things just so that we can say.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:09.460
say, we have a revival meeting on our calendar. Meet status quo of Baptist churches. No, no.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:19.020
I want God to work. And I desire for me personally, and I hope that you would desire for you personally

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:25.560
that you'd be ready for revival. That it would not be a situation where the preaching next

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.960
week has to be the breaking up the fallow ground and getting all the soil prepared and

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:38.960
then all of a sudden the evangelist is gone. But no, we personally would be ready for revival.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.820
That we will take, again, it's not an exhaustive list. You may have other things already that

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:51.820
you've thought of. But if we begin with some contemplation, it takes time. Self-examination

00:40:51.820 --> 00:41:02.180
takes time. Calling out to God and saying, God, search me. Show me. Lead me. That contemplation

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:12.880
will lead to confession. Confession is a good thing. To be clean. Not cleaner, but clean.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.160
That we could say, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. Oh man, that's wonderful.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:25.459
Then we cultivate that soil of our heart. We prepare our hearts. I believe at that point

00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:32.639
we're already having revival. We have that communion with God. Praying and seeking His

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:39.160
face and reading His Word. Meditating upon the truths that are contained therein. Saying,

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:47.120
God, speak to me. I preached a message back in August. Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.400
Every day when I read the Bible, I pray Psalm 119, open thou mine eyes that I may behold

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.240
wondrous things out of thy law. Since I preached that message in August, I can't say every

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.000
day, but almost every day, I've said, open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.840
things out of thy law. Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. I want God to speak to my

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:14.240
heart. I'm going to do a work. And so this morning, you want to be revival ready? See

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:22.240
God move and work and have that sweet communion that is beyond anything this world could ever

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:28.880
offer. So that's what I want. Maybe this week we can incorporate some of these things. I

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.479
tell you this morning, listen, the enemy's going to try to get you busy. He's going to

00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:36.360
try to have you have a week this week that's more busy than any week you've had in the

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:44.320
last six months. Why? Because revival's coming. Because we've got special meetings. That's

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.160
the way the enemy works. Just letting you know. That's how he works. That's the way

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.880
they have to do. We've got to protect. We've got to prepare. We've got to say, no, I want

00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:01.400
to be revival ready. Oh, that God would help us to be a people that experience revival.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:07.600
The psalmist said, will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee?

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:13.199
Come back tonight when the joy is withered away. Oh, I hope it'll be a blessing to you.

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:19.680
Because revival, the result is that rejoicing in thee, the outworking of that joy. David

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.400
said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. In that same Psalm 51 that we looked at a

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:32.400
little bit this morning. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:39.639
thank you for your Word. I pray that somehow this morning you've taken some truth, some

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:47.880
verse, many verses, and you've used them in the hearts and lives of these that are gathered

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:55.800
this morning. Personally, individually, I desire to be ready for revival. As the pastor,

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:04.360
I desire for our church, the folks that you've gathered, assembled here to be ready for revival.

00:44:07.919 --> 00:44:13.400
But the reality is that I can't make anyone else ready for revival. And there's not one

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:20.399
in this sanctuary that can make anyone else ready for revival. But individually, as we

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.320
allow you to work in our hearts and lives, we come to that place where we say, I want

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:32.320
to be ready for revival. God, would you help us to incorporate, implement these four principles

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.600
or thoughts into our lives this week. Help it to not just be this week, but to be regular

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.640
in our lives that we would contemplate, confess, cultivate, and have sweet communion with you.

00:44:49.799 --> 00:44:56.799
That we'd have revival. If there's one that's present that's not sure of heaven, I pray

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:03.880
that today would be the day of their salvation. I pray for each believer, God, that you'd

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:10.880
stir us, but change us. Well, thank you. Give you the praise and glory for all that

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.200
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.040
eyes are closed. Holly's going to play quietly on the piano. We're going to give you an opportunity

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.000
to respond. Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar and ask the Lord to help

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.720
you in one or all of these areas that we dealt with this morning. Maybe you want to make

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.320
your pew in altar. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.640
you can know for sure that heaven's your home. As Holly plays, the altar is open.
