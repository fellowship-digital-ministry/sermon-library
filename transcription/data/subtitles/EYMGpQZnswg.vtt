00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
It will be the source of our study here on Wednesday evening for the next four weeks.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.159
And we're going to walk through this psalm.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.600
I trust that it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.239
And this particular psalm has four distinct divisions consisting of two verses each.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:22.000
And so we'll take the next four weeks and we'll look at two verses each week.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.159
And again, trust that it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.159
I love the book of Psalms.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:32.080
If you read through the book of Psalms, you will find that often you are greatly encouraged

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.560
as you read the book of Psalms.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.360
It is exciting to me to have the opportunity to see how often the transparency of the psalmist

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.840
and it enables us really to be able to relate to the psalmist and to relate to life and

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.759
difficulties and triumphs and all that we deal with.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:56.639
And of course, as we study through the book of Psalms and read the Psalms devotionally,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:02.200
oftentimes our hearts are greatly encouraged through this particular book.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.480
This evening, as I mentioned, we'll be looking at Psalm 3.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.360
And over the next several weeks, I'm going to read the entire psalm this evening.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.760
And then we'll get into the message for this evening, part one, if you will.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.959
And the Bible says this,

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:19.000
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.360
Many are they that rise up against me.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.400
Many there be which say of my soul, there is no help for him in God, Selah.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.160
But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me, my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.279
I cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill, Selah.

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:43.800
I laid me down and slept.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.279
I awaked for the Lord sustained me.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:53.279
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:02:01.519
Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God, for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.599
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.160
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.960
Thy blessing is upon thy people, Selah.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.839
As you look at the book of Psalms, it's often very helpful to understand the setting of

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.320
the particular psalm that you're studying.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.679
And this evening and for the next several weeks as we study Psalm 3, you will note if

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:31.360
perhaps at the top of your Bible, if there's some level of inscription with regard to the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.639
setting of the particular psalm, your Bible may say that this is a psalm of David when

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.440
he fled from Absalom.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.759
And we are helped by understanding, obviously, if you study the life of David in its fullness,

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:51.360
you'll find there are many times in which he's dealing with difficulty and trials, of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.240
course, the times in which he's leaving and fleeing the presence of Saul.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.559
But this particular psalm is written according to the historical background that we have,

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:07.520
that it was written when he fled from Absalom, his son, not while he was fleeing from Saul,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.240
but rather when he was fleeing from Absalom.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
That portion of Scripture that records for us the rebellion, really, of Absalom and all

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.600
that takes place is found beginning in 2 Samuel 15 and really through the 19th chapter of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.559
the book of 2 Samuel.

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:27.080
If you want to hold your place here and turn over to 2 Samuel chapter 15, and I want to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.880
just read a few verses of Scripture by way of introduction this evening to really kind

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.720
of help us get the setting for this particular study.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.639
If you are taking notes, I've simply entitled this part one of Psalm 3 from the first verse,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.360
many rise against me.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.240
Many rise against me.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.960
Hold your place there in Psalm 3, and in 2 Samuel 15, the rebellion of Absalom begins

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.720
in this portion of Scripture.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.919
I would say this as you study these few chapters in 2 Samuel, that this was a very difficult

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.720
time in the life of David.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.880
The Bible begins by telling us of all that takes place, and verse number 1, it came to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.240
pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses and 50 men to run before

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240
him.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.100
And Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate, and it was so that when

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.880
any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.679
him and said, Of what city art thou?

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:33.760
And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:41.160
And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man deputed

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.079
of the king to hear thee.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.000
In other words, there was no one that was appointed in those particular cities, wherever

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.279
these individuals were coming from.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:56.119
And so Absalom is using this to his advantage, he's using this method really to gain a following,

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:02.559
it says in verse number 4, Absalom said, Moreover, O that I were made judge in the land, that

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:09.040
every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.679
And it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.779
hand and took him and kissed him.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.700
And on this matter did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.720
Notice this at the end of verse number 6, the Bible says this, So Absalom stole the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.000
hearts of the men of Israel.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Who's the king?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.519
The king is David.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:39.519
David has been king at this particular time for a lengthy portion of time.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:45.839
In fact, we find that from the time of his anointing to the time of this particular event

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.160
is right about 40 years, according to what we read in verse number 7.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.299
But we find that 40 years had passed from the anointing, and we know that David did

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:59.160
not become the king right after he'd been anointed, for Saul was the king, and there

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.519
was a period of preparation.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:07.600
But we find that David is established as being the king of Israel, and Absalom is stealing

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.839
away the hearts of the men of Israel.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.799
The Bible tells us, if you skip down to verse number 10, it says, But Absalom sent spies

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:20.640
toward all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.359
then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:30.239
Whoa, what's going on here?

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.519
Absalom had not been anointed to be the next king of Israel.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:39.000
David is still very much in that particular place, and we know that David, though he had

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.239
been anointed to be king, when Saul had already been rejected by God of being king, and David

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:51.040
had opportunity to use his own power and his own might to deal with matters in his own

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.160
hands, David refused to lift his hand against God's anointed.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.519
He was going to await God to deal with Saul and for David to be put in that place as king.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:08.079
But now his own son Absalom has risen up against him, and he says that when you hear the trumpet,

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:12.399
he tells all of these folks, all these spies go through all the tribes, and they say, As

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:18.200
soon as you hear the trumpet, here's what you should shout, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.519
Notice in verse number 13, skip down a few more verses, it says this, And there came

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:28.959
a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.480
And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.920
us flee, for we shall not else escape from Absalom, make speed to depart, lest he overtake

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.420
us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.559
This is the backdrop, this is the setting for the psalm in which we're studying here

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:54.880
over the next few weeks, and we begin that study this evening, looking at verses 1 and

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880
2.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.440
Again, if you are taking notes, the title for the message this evening, part 1, is Many

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.359
Rise Against Me.

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:03.760
And I just want to share this thought with you tonight.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:11.320
Notice with me the reality of the situation back in Psalm 3, in verses 1 and 2, God gives

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.880
us a glimpse into the reality of the situation.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.559
It would seem that after those verses that we read in verses 13 and 14 of 2 Samuel 15,

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:27.160
that at some point after that departure and that fleeing, perhaps on that evening, David

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.200
sat down and penned the words of this particular psalm.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.760
And I want you to notice the reality of the situation, really we're given three insights

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.200
as to what's going on.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:44.880
Notice what he says in verse number 1, how are they increased that trouble me?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.159
How are they increased that trouble me?

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:55.400
He then says this in verse number 1, we've used it as our title, many are they that rise

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.679
up against me.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:04.039
David is acknowledging the reality of the situation, he's speaking, and we have the

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:10.840
opportunity by going back to the text in 2 Samuel 15 to determine exactly that this

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:17.520
conspiracy that has taken place, that this revolt that Absalom has led, we skipped over

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.080
verse number 12 in 2 Samuel 15, but at the end of that verse it says this, and the conspiracy

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:31.080
was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:39.239
So David, he says in this psalm, Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:44.359
Many are they that rise up against me.

00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:48.960
Notice what he says in verse number 2, as again we're gaining the opportunity to see

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.799
exactly what's taking place, he says, many there be which say of my soul.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:59.840
Notice what they say, it says there is no help for him.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.840
in God.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.420
Selah.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.840
These that have troubled David,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.920
these that have risen up against David,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.800
these are saying of David,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.380
there's no help for him in God.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.140
God can't even do anything in this situation.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.760
The reality of the situation,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.680
it's interesting, we won't take the time

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.520
to go back to 2 Samuel 16,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.340
but perhaps you want to write down

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.980
in your notes there and see.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.020
You'll probably remember the name of Shimei,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.660
one of the characters that is referenced there

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.060
in 2 Samuel 16 during that time of departure.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.040
And you'll find that in verse number five

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.860
of 2 Samuel 16, the Bible tells us

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.880
that this man Shimei, he cursed David.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.860
The next verse of Scripture tells us

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.060
that he cast stones at David.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.740
And so in verse number five, he's cursing David

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.140
and in verse number six, he's casting stones at David.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.080
If you look down later into the chapter

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.840
in verse number 13, it tells us that he cursed him,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.520
he cast stones and he cast dust.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.840
And we find here that David is aware of the situation

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.200
and the reality of the situation is made known to us.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.720
And as I look at the psalmist

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.520
and I look at this particular text of Scripture

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.300
and I see that this is not an exaggerated perception.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.440
This is not something that David has just simply conjured up

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.800
in his imagination and he's painting this picture

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.800
of despair and dismay of, oh, everybody's against me.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.440
No, no, this was reality.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.920
This is what he was facing, this is what he was dealing with.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.180
And we find that throughout the Psalms,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.480
not just here in Psalm 3, but many times

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.400
as you read throughout the book of Psalms,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.920
that you'll find that there are references

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.820
to this particular time in the life of David

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.420
when he references the experience of dealing

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.340
with this revolt of his son and all that he dealt with

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.900
and the struggles that he had

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.840
and the many that rose up against him.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.820
Job tells us this in Job 14 in verse number one.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.500
It's a verse of Scripture that we've often referenced

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.140
through the years when you think about the difficulties

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.420
and trials, it says, man that is born of a woman

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.440
who is a few days and full of trouble.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.840
And the reality is that as we look at this particular Psalm

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.880
over the next few weeks and study Psalm 3,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.160
I hope that we'd have the opportunity

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.440
to not only understand what David is dealing with

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.320
in his own life and understanding the struggle

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.560
in this particular situation, the reality of the situation

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.320
as we note in verses one and two,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.080
but I hope this evening and throughout the next few weeks

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.840
that we'll have the opportunity

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.180
to be able to relate to David

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.540
and to understand that we too sometimes

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.440
are going to face difficulties such as this.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.320
Remember that Paul said that there was an open door,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.760
but he says this, there are many adversaries.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.700
It was not a situation where there was an open door

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.740
and everybody was just welcoming Paul

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.880
and so excited to see Paul coming to preach the gospel.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.200
We find that often as you study in particular,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.380
if you study the first missionary journey,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.620
that each of the cities in which Paul and Barnabas went into

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.820
you'll find that they were just run out of the town

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.820
and they faced much persecution, trouble, and difficulty.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.500
And they weren't excited about the people

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.900
that were coming to Christ and the livelihood

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.980
of those that sold the idols

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.680
and other things that were taking place.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.260
They were in opposition to the gospel of Christ

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.980
going forward.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.300
And as we begin to study this psalm

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.940
and we note the reality here

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.740
and he says that they are increased that trouble me.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.660
There are many that rise up against me.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.860
They say of my soul, there is no help for him in God.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.780
Selah.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.220
I find that at times when we consider

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.180
the world in which we're living

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.460
that no doubt we can at times feel as if

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.920
the enemy is increasing.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.040
We can feel the way that David gives us this picture

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.760
and the situation he's dealing with.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.120
Again, it's the reality of the situation

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.180
that they're increased that trouble me.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.880
Many that are against me.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.920
We find that we're living in a time

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.840
in which there are many that oppose biblical Christianity.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.440
It's just a reality that we're facing.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.360
But what does that mean?

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.540
What does it mean when we understand the reality?

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.420
Next week, we're gonna look at the response

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.500
to the situation in the next two verses

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.740
and really, that's where we're gonna get

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.740
into some real application for us

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.620
and understanding that though we understand

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.300
the reality of a situation,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.300
how we respond to that situation is of utmost importance.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.620
We do not just bury our head in the sand.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.900
We don't run for the caves and run for the hills

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.100
and give up and compromise

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.720
and whatever the other ideas or responses could be.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.440
No, Paul tells Timothy this

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.800
when he's giving him the truth

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.520
in 2 Timothy 3 with regard to,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.140
yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.480
shall suffer persecution,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.560
verse number 12 of 2 Timothy 3.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.520
He tells him that evil men and seducers

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.760
shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.680
And the very next words are but continue.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.620
But continue.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.540
What a great truth, what a great challenge

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.500
for us as the people of God.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
Turn over to the book of John, if you will.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.140
And I want you to see, listen,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.480
we understand that broad is the path

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.740
that leads to destruction.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.300
We understand that narrow is the way

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.740
that leads to righteousness.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.540
We understand that there are many that have forsaken.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.620
There are many that have opposed.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.300
There are many that shake their fist at God.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.840
But we are more than conquerors.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
Amen?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.960
We are on the winning side.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.640
And we find that as we look at John 15,

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.320
and we try to make some parallels this evening

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.960
and consider what David is dealing with

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.600
in the reality of the situation,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.280
notice what Jesus says to His disciples in John 15.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.360
Beginning in verse number 18, notice what He says.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.780
If the world hates you,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.560
ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.800
If ye were of the world, the world would love His own.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.680
But because you're not of the world,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.680
but I have chosen you out of the world,

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.840
therefore the world hateth you.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.520
Remember the word that I said unto you,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.720
the servant is not greater than his Lord.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.940
If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.400
If they have kept My saying, they will keep yours also.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.140
Now, you understand that this word

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.040
that Jesus is giving to His disciples

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.680
is a truthful word.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.480
Jesus is seeking to prepare His disciples,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.680
and no doubt it's been preserved for us

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.880
to help us to be prepared as well.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.560
I believe that each of us would love it

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.220
if everyone loved us.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.160
I just thought that it was wonderful

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.280
that you believe the Bible.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.800
Man, that's so wonderful.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.040
We're so excited for you.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.240
But that's not how many people respond to us, is it?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.040
If the world hates you, what do you say?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.280
You know that it hated Me before it hated you.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.680
Notice in chapter 16 in verse number one,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.880
these things have I spoken unto you

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.480
that you should not be offended.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.520
They shall put you out of the synagogues,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.580
yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.880
will think that he doeth God's service,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.880
and these things will they do unto you.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.720
Why?

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.800
Because they have not known the Father nor Me.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.360
But these things have I told you

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.040
that when the time shall come,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.760
you may remember that I told you of them.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.640
These things I said not unto you at the beginning

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.120
because I was with you,

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.600
but now I go on My way to Him that sent Me,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.080
and none of you asketh Me whither goest now,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.000
but because I have said these things unto you,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.140
sorrow hath filled your heart.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.160
He had told them at the beginning of chapter 14,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.520
let not your heart be troubled.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.960
But now He's saying because I've told you these things

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.720
that sorrow hath filled your heart,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.200
I can understand how they would respond that way,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.840
can't you?

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.880
The time's gonna come,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.880
they're gonna put you out of the synagogue,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.400
the one that kills you is gonna think

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.040
that he does God's service.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.040
I mean, we're not standing around and saying,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.160
woohoo, praise the Lord, that's wonderful, Jesus,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.600
thank you for letting me know.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.940
No, no, sorrow filled their heart.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.440
But notice what He says in verse number seven.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.320
Nevertheless, I tell you the truth,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.280
is that it is expedient for you that I go away,

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.480
for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.120
but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.800
It's advantageous, it's beneficial for you,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.120
it's expedient for you that I go away,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.820
because if I go or since I'm going,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.880
I'm going to send the Comforter to you.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.360
Aren't you so thankful?

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.040
The Holy Spirit of God indwells the saved individual.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.760
And as we have the Spirit of God indwelling us,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.960
it enables us to respond to those difficulties,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.800
it enables us to respond to those trials

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.900
in which we deal with.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.280
The reality of the situation, listen,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.680
evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.240
This is a reality of the situation.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.400
We find it as we read the book of Acts,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.760
and you read and understand and study

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.640
all that's taking place with the advancement of the gospel

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.180
and the challenges and the adversities

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.020
and the hatred that the religious crowd

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.020
and the lost crowd.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.980
had for the people of God.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.300
But we find that as you study the book of Acts, that there were a group of people that

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:15.020
were empowered by the Spirit of God, and it always convicts me as I read the latter part

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:21.180
of Acts chapter number 5, after the disciples had faced great difficulty, and they had been

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.380
imprisoned, they had been beaten, they had been threatened, and all of these things that

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.380
have taken place.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.820
The Bible tells us in Acts 5 in verse number 40, and to him, speaking of Gamaliel, according

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:39.180
to verse number 34, he gives some counsel to these religious leaders, and to him they

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.040
agreed.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.420
When they had called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.020
speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:55.020
And they, speaking of the disciples, departed from the presence of the council, and notice

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:02.180
the end of verse number 41, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.460
His name.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.460
That's a group of people that are filled with the Spirit of God.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.820
It's a group of people that are dealing with the reality of the situation where there were

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.940
people that were opposing the work that they were called to do, there were people that

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.540
had imprisoned them, people that had beaten them, people that had threatened them, but

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.980
yet when they depart from the presence of this council, they depart rejoicing that

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.860
they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.100
The Bible tells us that daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.300
and preach Jesus Christ.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.260
Wow, what an example for us.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:50.260
What an example of how we respond to the difficulties in which we deal with in life.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.740
We're told in 1 John 3 and verse number 13,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:58.820
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.380
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.940
John heard Jesus speak those words that we referenced earlier in John chapter number

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.820
15.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.980
Did he not?

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.580
He was there.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.420
He heard those words.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.700
And now as he's writing to this group of believers in the book of 1 John, he says,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.620
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:27.020
And as we note the reality of the situation in which David was facing, the circumstances

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.820
in which he was dealing with the writing of Psalm 3, as we understand the setting and

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.460
we understand the revolt and the rebellion and all that takes place, we understand this

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.300
is a real situation that he's facing.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:47.620
And in the reality of the situation, when those that are against me, they are increased

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.700
that trouble me, when there are many that rise against me, when they say of me that

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.260
there is no help for him in God, how do we respond to that?

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.740
How do we respond?

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:06.300
In verses 3 and 4 of Psalm 3, we'll study that in its entirety next week and really

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.380
draw your attention to the response of David in this situation.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:17.060
And the reality is that I'm thankful this evening that the Scriptures teach us that

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:23.260
we are more than conquerors through Christ.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.020
Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.020
Amen?

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.820
He says, if God be for us, who can be against us?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.300
We say, well, do you want us to make a list?

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.140
Because we have some people that are against us.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:44.420
But what he's saying is that we're more than conquerors through Christ.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.500
We serve the King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:54.180
He did not tell us that being in the service of the Lord was going to be a walk through

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.740
the park.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.980
Correct?

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.900
Really?

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.420
Someone described it this way, I think it was Tozer, I do not quote me on that, I believe

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:13.060
it was Tozer that said that the Christian life can be best described not as a playground

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.820
but as a battleground.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.980
Have we not found it to be so?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.820
We're engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:28.240
And as we look at this psalm, there's such an opportunity for us to relate to the psalmist

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:34.380
and understand what he was dealing with personally and physically, historically, the account is

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.460
given to us of what he's dealing with, and as we would draw application, we'd say, okay,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:43.880
what do we do when there's our people that are increased, that trouble me, when there

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.720
are many that are rising against me?

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.200
When they say that there's no help in God for us.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.860
The response is one of we must run to the Lord, we must run to God, and we must trust

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:05.060
Him, and we must continue, as Paul said to Timothy, but continue thou in the things which

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.340
thou hast learned.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.140
But continue.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:16.220
This evening, I believe, as many of you believe, that we're living in the last days.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.340
Jesus is coming soon, amen?

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.660
And soon is relative, I don't know how long it's going to be before He comes back, but

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:28.420
it seems as if His return is soon.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:34.660
And as we live in the last days, as we live in these turbulent times, if you will, when

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.380
there are so many that would rise against, remember, I referenced this a couple of weeks

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:46.140
ago in the second psalm where the Bible tells us that the kings, the rulers of the world,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:55.460
that they rise up against the Lord, against His anointed, they shake their fist at God.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.780
And the reality of the situation for David is that there were many that were against

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.460
Him.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:10.220
The conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with Absalom, we're told in 2

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.980
Samuel 15 and verse number 12.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:20.620
This evening, though the first of this four-part series seems to have a negative note, I trust

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.620
that we'd be encouraged as we consider that, listen, it's okay to understand the reality

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:32.380
of what we're dealing with, but how we respond to that is of utmost importance.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:37.380
And as we come in your time this week, as you study through verses three and four, I

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:43.820
hope that you'd be encouraged as to seeing how David responds to the situation which

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:50.300
he's dealing with, and that we'd say, God, would you help me to respond in faith?

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.780
Would you help me to respond in courage and in boldness?

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:59.100
Would you help me to respond like the disciples responded in Acts chapter number 5?

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:06.220
Would you help me to have that kind of boldness and courage to trust you and to follow you?

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.500
Help us to continue.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:18.700
There are many that are against the cause of Christ, but God told us that that would

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.180
be the case.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.420
So it really shouldn't surprise us.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.060
We still have a duty to fulfill.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.300
Amen?

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:32.420
And as we fulfill that duty, as we are filled with the Spirit of God and we go forth in

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:38.260
the power of God, we get to see what God is able to do.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.300
And we are on the winning side.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300
Let's pray.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.460
Father, we love you.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.620
We thank you for loving us.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.100
We thank you for the opportunity to study your Word.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:56.180
And as we begin this four-part study this evening on this third psalm, I pray that you

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.260
would help us over these weeks to be encouraged and strengthened.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:07.420
Would you help us, Lord, to be prepared for the adversity and the opposition that we would

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:14.420
face all throughout your Word as we read of those that have gone before us that have served

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.940
you faithfully, that have done a work for you.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:24.620
We find that throughout those various accounts, there are many times in which we can read

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.460
of the opposition.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.500
We can read of the adversity in which they faced and dealt with, the troubles and the

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.220
trials.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.860
I'm thankful for the triumphs.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:41.619
I'm thankful that we have the whole Bible and we know that we are indeed on the winning

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.619
side.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:54.739
We do not need to respond with some level of fear, hiding, compromise, giving up.

00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:57.100
But we simply continue.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.100
Continue in your power for your glory.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.059
We thank you for the privilege of prayer, for corporate prayer.

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:11.000
What a blessing to hear the voices of your people each Wednesday evening as they lift

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.280
up their voice and bring these various petitions before thy throne.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.119
We thank you that you're a God who hears and answers prayer, that you're able to do exceeding

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:24.440
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.280
We pray that you'd bless these next moments in our service, and we'll thank you, God,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280
for all that you'll do.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.559
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
