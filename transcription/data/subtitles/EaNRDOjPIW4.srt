1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,000
is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,200
When I know what God says, it enables me to boldly say, the Lord is my helper, I shall

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,360
not fear what man shall do unto me.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,959
That was free tonight, amen?

6
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:35,139
Deuteronomy chapter number 11, and we'll be looking here at the first 17 verses of

7
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,139
Deuteronomy 11.

8
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:41,319
Of course, last week, as you know, we started a mini-series that I entitled, The Danger

9
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,520
of Deception.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,959
I am thoroughly convinced that we are currently living in an age of deception.

11
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:54,639
I believe that as we look around our world, that it is not too difficult for any of us

12
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,159
to recognize that we are living in an age of deception.

13
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,720
In fact, as we study the Word of God, we find that our God has graciously warned us about

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,580
the reality of deception.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,099
He told us that it was going to be the case.

16
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:15,720
Not only did He warn us about the deception that we would face, but I am very thankful

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,440
that He has given us the truth of His Word, He has provided us with the remedy for deception.

18
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,000
What a blessing to know and to have the Word of God and to know the truth.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What a blessing.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,959
We will recall that as we began our series last Wednesday evening, that I mentioned to

21
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,599
you, and it is worth pointing out again this evening, that the tool of deception has been

22
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,559
in the adversary's toolbox since the Garden.

23
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:55,319
We understand that it is a tool that he regularly uses, the tool of deception.

24
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,919
It's in his toolbox and he uses it often, and we find that no doubt, even in the age

25
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,639
in which we're living, we are facing great deception.

26
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:11,960
If you're taking notes this evening, the title for the message is from verse number 16.

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,039
I'll read that verse.

28
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,479
For sake of time, I won't read all 17 verses.

29
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,080
We'll read them as we go through.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,160
But in verse number 16, the Bible says this,

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,119
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived.

32
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:28,619
And you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them.

33
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:34,520
So the title for the message this evening, that your heart be not deceived.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,880
That your heart be not deceived.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,479
I believe as we look at the book of Deuteronomy that we're mindful that God is preparing His

36
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,740
people for the entrance into the land of promise.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:53,179
We understand that God had many years before given this promise that His people would enter

38
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,860
into the land of promise.

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,539
And as we study and read the book of Deuteronomy, we find that God is using Moses to prepare

40
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,339
the children of Israel for entrance into the land, reminding them of many things.

41
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:12,860
And as we understand the context here in Deuteronomy chapter number 11, we find that the first 15

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
verses are rich.

43
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:20,660
I mean, the first 15 verses of Deuteronomy chapter number 11 are really a reminder to

44
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:29,419
the people of what God has done and then revealing to the people what God will do for them.

45
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,500
And it's exciting.

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Look at it in verse number 1.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,899
Therefore, thou shalt love the Lord thy God and keep His charge and His statutes and His

48
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,899
judgments and His commandments always.

49
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,619
It's not a temporary thing.

50
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:49,220
It was a command given to them for the longevity.

51
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,940
It says this, and know ye this day for I speak not with your children which have not known

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,899
and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, His greatness, His mighty

53
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:07,779
hand and His stretched out arm and His miracles and His acts which He did in the midst of

54
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:13,419
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt and unto all His land.

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,739
And what He did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses and their chariots, how He made

56
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:24,019
the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord

57
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,739
hath destroyed them unto this day.

58
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:32,660
Notice in these first four verses, we find this reminder again of the mighty acts of

59
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,019
God and what He did.

60
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,899
You think about as the Word of God is being given and as the minds of the people as they're

61
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:46,339
hearing the words, they're going all the way back to the time in Egypt when God performed

62
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:53,459
the miracles, the plagues, and then He's dealing in verse number 4 with the crossing over the

63
00:04:53,459 --> 00:05:00,459
Red Sea and we find that this reminder of the miracles and the acts of God, it's encouraging

64
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,920
to be reminded of what God has done.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,260
He says in verse number 5, and what He did unto you in the wilderness until you came

66
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,640
into this place, and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben,

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,799
how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents

68
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:22,720
and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel.

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,359
Now you understand that verse number 6 is really a word of warning, is it not?

70
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:32,519
This is, remember in verse number 2, He says that you've seen the chastisement of the Lord

71
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,239
but you've also seen His greatness and His mighty hand, His stretched out arm.

72
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:41,959
We understand that the Bible teaches us, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth, and they saw

73
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,540
the chastisement, they saw the judgment.

74
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:51,839
What is mentioned here in verse number 6 with Dathan and Abiram is the judgment of God.

75
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,700
What a great warning and a great reminder, in fact, Paul will reference some of those

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,880
types of things like what we see in verse number 6 in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10.

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Notice in verse number 7,

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,760
But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which He did.

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,559
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may

80
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:16,640
be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it, and that ye may prolong

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,160
your days in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,579
their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey.

83
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:29,739
For the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence

84
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:35,380
ye came out, where thou sowest thy seed, and waterest it with thy foot as a garden

85
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
of herbs.

86
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,940
But the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh

87
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,019
water of the rain of heaven, a land, notice this in verse number 12, a land which the

88
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,100
Lord thy God careth for.

89
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,179
The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto

90
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,619
the end of the year.

91
00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:00,920
And it shall come to pass, and then notice this word, if.

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,179
It shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command

93
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:10,660
you this day, to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with

94
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,140
all your soul, that I will give you the rain of your land in His due season.

95
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,179
The first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and

96
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,339
thine oil.

97
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,260
And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full.

98
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,399
That sounds good, doesn't it?

99
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,140
God is telling them this is what I've done for you and God is saying this is what I'm

100
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,660
going to do for you as you obey me, as you follow me, as you hearken to me, that I'm

101
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
going to do these things.

102
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,100
And these are fabulous, wonderful things.

103
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:53,140
And then we get to verse number 16 and he says, take heed to yourselves that your heart

104
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,980
be not deceived.

105
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,380
And ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them.

106
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,779
Do you know this actually happened to the children of Israel?

107
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,799
Their heart was deceived and they followed idols.

108
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:15,640
It says in verse number 17, and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and He

109
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,760
shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest

110
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,320
ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you.

111
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,040
Focus our attention on verse number 16.

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,659
It's interesting to me as we look at the context of Deuteronomy 11 and we understand the place

113
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,919
of the warning.

114
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,539
It's in the time of the blessing of God and a time in which God is doing what He said

115
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:52,080
that He would do and He says, take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived.

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,359
The heart we find as we look throughout the Word of God, God's Word says much to us about

117
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:01,080
the heart and we can look at a number of passages.

118
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,719
We will not have time this evening to do that, but we find the Bible talks about a hard heart,

119
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:10,820
a proud heart, a pure heart, an understanding heart, just to mention a few.

120
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,479
And there are many references to the heart.

121
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:19,599
It's been defined as the seat of the affections and passions, the seat of the understanding,

122
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,500
the seat of the will.

123
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,239
You'll be mindful that it was God in Genesis chapter number 6, you don't need to turn there,

124
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:33,000
but He's speaking to Noah and talking about the judgment that would come with regard to

125
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,960
the wickedness God saw in verse number 5 of Genesis 6, that the wickedness of man was

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,960
great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

127
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:55,000
We think about this warning in Deuteronomy 11 and really we couple it with what Jeremiah

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,919
proclaims in Jeremiah 17 in verse number 9 when he says,

129
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,999
The heart is deceitful above all things,

130
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,739
and desperately wicked.

131
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,999
Who can know it?

132
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:13,279
The answer is given in v. 10 of Jeremiah 17.

133
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,939
I, the Lord, search the heart.

134
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:15,979
I try the rains,

135
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,979
even to give every man according to his ways

136
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:20,179
and according to the fruit of his doing.

137
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,939
But in the idea this evening

138
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,619
that your heart be not deceived,

139
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:27,259
we recognize that God is telling His people

140
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,459
and telling us through preservation

141
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,339
that the heart is deceitful above all things,

142
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,279
and desperately wicked.

143
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,579
Who can know it?

144
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,059
He says that your heart be not deceived.

145
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,599
It's interesting back in Deuteronomy 11

146
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,399
in v. 16 when He says

147
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,619
that your heart be not deceived,

148
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:51,739
the Hebrew word there that is translated deceived,

149
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,979
it carries with it the idea of being

150
00:10:53,979 --> 00:11:00,799
simple, naïve, gullible.

151
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,139
But this is the one that hit me the most.

152
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,099
Open-minded.

153
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,299
Open-minded.

154
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,759
Why does it hit me the most?

155
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,679
Well, because how often do we hear people today say,

156
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,759
you just need to be open-minded?

157
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,699
Right?

158
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,979
We hear it all the time.

159
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:18,999
We hear people say,

160
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,339
oh, you just need to broaden your horizon.

161
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,459
You just need to be more open-minded

162
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,259
and you need to be more inclusive

163
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,899
and so on and so forth.

164
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,899
You need to be open-minded.

165
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,979
And when they use that phraseology,

166
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:34,259
oftentimes what they'll do is they'll say,

167
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,979
you are just narrow-minded.

168
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,439
That's the opposite of being open-minded

169
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,859
is being narrow-minded.

170
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,139
And we've been accused of being narrow-minded.

171
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,019
And often I've said I can only be

172
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,019
as wide as my Bible is. Amen?

173
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,539
And we're going to be as narrow

174
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,459
as the Word of God is. Why?

175
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,179
As a preacher from yesteryear said,

176
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,619
never, or let me put it this way,

177
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,459
this is how he said it,

178
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,899
where God puts a period,

179
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,499
don't put a question mark.

180
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,339
What's he saying?

181
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,219
Just trust God's Word.

182
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,219
It's not necessary.

183
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:10,499
Listen, God understood as He gave us the Word of God,

184
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,499
He is the eternal God,

185
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,939
Alpha and Omega,

186
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,219
the first and the last,

187
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:16,459
the beginning and the end.

188
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,739
He understood the cultures

189
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,379
and the various aspects of thoughts

190
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,139
that human beings would have.

191
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,939
It's nothing new.

192
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,819
We see all the way back in Genesis 6,

193
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:30,859
the reason that I use that passage of Scripture

194
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:33,819
to talk about the heart being wicked,

195
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,139
this idea of deception that began in the garden

196
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,939
in Genesis chapter number three.

197
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:42,779
And he says that we need to take heed to yourselves

198
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,059
that your heart be not deceived.

199
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,739
And the word means to be simple,

200
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,139
to be naive, to be gullible,

201
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,539
or to be open-minded.

202
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,859
I understand that we're living in a time,

203
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,459
in an era, in a generation,

204
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,779
when it's popular that people are saying

205
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,859
you just need to be open-minded.

206
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:04,779
You need to consider other ways of thinking.

207
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,339
You need to understand and consider other perspectives.

208
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,339
Why would I leave the truth

209
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,699
for something that's less than truth?

210
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,739
It doesn't really make sense, does it?

211
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:21,339
And so if God has given us the truth,

212
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,139
and He has,

213
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,739
and we hold the Scriptures in our hands,

214
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,099
and we have the truth,

215
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,459
I don't need to be open-minded

216
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,379
to all of the new ideas

217
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,779
and all of the ideas that our world would have.

218
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,539
No, I need to have the mind of Christ.

219
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,379
Amen?

220
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,579
Here's what Paul says in the book of Philippians.

221
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,059
He says, let this mind be in you,

222
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,939
which was also in Christ Jesus,

223
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:50,259
in Philippians 2, in verse number five.

224
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,659
And we find it in the book of 1 Corinthians.

225
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,619
He talks about that we have the mind of Christ.

226
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:58,099
To know God is to know His word.

227
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,379
And we understand that God has given.

228
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,779
In fact, throughout the chapter of Deuteronomy 11,

229
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,779
as we've read through these first 17 verses,

230
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,299
we see that there are many references

231
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,539
to the importance of keeping the commandments

232
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,139
and following the commandments.

233
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,459
In verses 18, 19, and 20,

234
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,179
I will not have time to read those verses,

235
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,539
but it's very similar to the text of Scripture

236
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,979
that I preached on Sunday morning

237
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:23,619
from Deuteronomy chapter number six.

238
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:26,979
The importance of the commands of the Lord

239
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,099
and His statutes and His judgments.

240
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,259
And we find that here,

241
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,339
the word of God is to have a prominent place in our lives.

242
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,259
And when God's word has that prominent place in our lives,

243
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:42,059
that is really the key that we would not have,

244
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,979
that our hearts would not be deceived.

245
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:51,299
As I think about the warning that is given here,

246
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,259
I'm mindful of Jeremiah once again.

247
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,299
Turn over to Jeremiah 44, if you will.

248
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,579
We referenced already in Jeremiah 17

249
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,939
the way in which the Bible tells us

250
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,819
that the heart is deceitful above all things.

251
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,699
And Jeremiah 44,

252
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,059
you'll find that in this passage of Scripture,

253
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,659
there's some dialogue that takes place.

254
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,019
And I just want to read a few verses of Scripture to you

255
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,099
to help you see the deception of these people.

256
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,699
God says this in verse number three,

257
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,499
because of their wickedness which they have committed

258
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,699
to provoke Me to anger in that they went to burn incense

259
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,339
and to serve other gods whom they knew not,

260
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,419
neither they, ye, nor your fathers.

261
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,819
Howbeit, I sent unto you all My servants,

262
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,579
the prophets, rising early,

263
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,699
and sending them, saying,

264
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,019
O, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

265
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,619
Isn't God so gracious in longsuffering?

266
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,979
They forsook the Lord.

267
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,339
They forgot the Lord.

268
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,299
They followed after idols.

269
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,859
But God in His grace and His mercy

270
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,299
and His longsuffering,

271
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,619
He sent prophets,

272
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:01,299
and He sent those prophets faithfully.

273
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,739
Jeremiah, one of them.

274
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,579
But notice what it says in verse number eight,

275
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:07,459
But they hearkened not,

276
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,179
or inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness

277
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,659
to burn no incense unto other gods.

278
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,899
Wherefore, My fury and Mine anger was poured forth

279
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,099
and was kindled in the cities of Judah

280
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:19,819
and in the streets of Jerusalem,

281
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:24,499
and they are wasted and desolate as at this day.

282
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:27,259
What did God say back in Deuteronomy 11?

283
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,459
He said that if you had a deceived heart

284
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,979
and you followed after other gods,

285
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:36,099
that He would withhold the rain.

286
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,499
Remember, He said, if you obey Me,

287
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,579
if you keep these commandments,

288
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:40,779
I'm gonna send the rain,

289
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,699
the former and the latter rain.

290
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,899
I'm gonna bless and I'm gonna,

291
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,659
God controls, listen, there's no mother nature.

292
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:50,019
It's God that's controlling, amen.

293
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,899
He is the creator and the sustainer of all things.

294
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,899
And we find here that as you skip down

295
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,379
and look at verse number 16, if you will,

296
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,139
as the word of the Lord then came,

297
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,779
it says, as for the word that thou has spoken unto us

298
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:05,979
in the name of the Lord,

299
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,659
we will not hearken unto thee.

300
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,619
And so, Jeremiah takes them a message.

301
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,499
They had requested of Jeremiah

302
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,739
to seek the face of God on their behalf,

303
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,059
and Jeremiah faithfully does that,

304
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,539
and God faithfully answers Jeremiah,

305
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,579
and Jeremiah delivers that message,

306
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,939
and they say, we're not gonna hearken unto thee.

307
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,419
By the way, they had made a commitment

308
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,139
when they initially requested Jeremiah

309
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:32,299
to go on their behalf and to get the word from God,

310
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,939
that whatever He says, we will do.

311
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,739
And then he brought back the message,

312
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:40,459
and they said, no, that's not right.

313
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,579
We're not gonna hearken to that.

314
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:43,419
It says this.

315
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,259
Notice what they say.

316
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,939
This is a deceived heart.

317
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:51,939
But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth

318
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,739
out of our own mouth to burn incense

319
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,819
unto the queen of heaven,

320
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,939
and to pour out drink offerings unto her,

321
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:03,539
as we have done, we and our fathers,

322
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,299
our kings and our princes,

323
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,299
in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.

324
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,219
For then had we plenty of vittles,

325
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:15,099
and were well, and saw no evil.

326
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,059
God's grace and God's mercy and God's long-suffering

327
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,339
was misinterpreted by the people of God

328
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,019
as being God's approval,

329
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,459
that God was okay with their behavior,

330
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,700
because God didn't immediately judge them.

331
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
They thought, man, when we were serving these idols

332
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,579
and pouring these things out to the queen of heaven,

333
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,619
we had plenty.

334
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,059
We didn't have all these problems.

335
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,619
We have the problems that you're dealing with now

336
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,380
because God's judgment came.

337
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,579
And instead of them turning to God,

338
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:51,419
they said, you know what?

339
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,779
We're just gonna keep on doing what we did before.

340
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,299
Man, that's terrible.

341
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,299
And God tells us in Deuteronomy 11, take heed,

342
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:03,859
and here's what he says,

343
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:07,619
take heed that your heart be not deceived.

344
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,419
How many times have you heard somebody say,

345
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,940
I mentioned about hearing people say all the time

346
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,899
in the culture and the society in which we're living

347
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,380
that we need to be open-minded and we've dealt with that,

348
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,859
but I want you to consider this.

349
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,700
How many times do you hear people say, follow your heart?

350
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,539
You've heard people say that?

351
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,979
Do you know that's a bad idea?

352
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,539
Honestly.

353
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,019
You know why it's a bad idea?

354
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,099
Turn to the book of Proverbs, if you will.

355
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,579
Proverbs chapter 28.

356
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,619
It's not a bad idea because I'm saying it's a bad idea.

357
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:43,899
It's a bad idea because God told us it was a bad idea.

358
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,539
Amen?

359
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,139
Because our heart is deceitful above all things.

360
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,739
I've heard people say, follow your heart.

361
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,179
I'm just following my heart.

362
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:54,859
I've heard people say, I'm following my gut.

363
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,579
I'm not sure that's a good idea either.

364
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,139
But the reality is that you hear this thing about.

365
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,199
following your heart.

366
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,159
But notice what it says in Proverbs 28.

367
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,599
Look in verse number 25.

368
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,239
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife.

369
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,239
But notice what it says.

370
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,799
He that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat.

371
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,879
Continue, verse 26.

372
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:26,479
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.

373
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,079
Is that what your Bible says?

374
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,319
I'm not making it up, amen?

375
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,079
That's what the Word of God says.

376
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,359
But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

377
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,359
Do you see the contrast in verses 25 and 26 between the one that puts his trust in the

378
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,799
Lord versus the one that's trusting in his own heart?

379
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,599
Your heart and my heart can deceive us.

380
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,399
It's not about me following my heart.

381
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,519
It's about me following the Lord.

382
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,759
We sang tonight about following the Lord.

383
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,979
Anywhere with Jesus, I can go, right?

384
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,019
As I follow him.

385
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:05,619
And we find here that we trust in him, and as we put our trust in the Lord, it says that

386
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:11,619
he shall be made fat, but if we trust in our own heart, we're a fool.

387
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,859
Why does he say that?

388
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,899
Because the heart is deceitful.

389
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:23,419
And he gives the warning to his people in Deuteronomy 11, preserved for us, take heed

390
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,419
that your heart be not deceived.

391
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,179
You say, oh man, my heart's not going to be deceived.

392
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,219
I can trust my heart.

393
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:37,459
First Corinthians 11 says, let he that thinketh he stand, take heed lest he fall, amen?

394
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:41,219
I think it's verse 12 in First Corinthians 11, verse 12.

395
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:48,019
And so the reality is that we must take heed to the warning that God gives us.

396
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,499
How do we respond to the warning?

397
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:53,499
Well, he says take heed in the verse of Scripture in chapter 11 and verse 16 of the book of

398
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,499
Deuteronomy.

399
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,699
And I mentioned that last week because that's what Jesus said as well.

400
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,939
It means to see, to discern, to beware.

401
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,179
I believe this.

402
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:04,979
Turn back, you're in the book of Proverbs right now, turn back to the fourth chapter

403
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:08,019
if you will, chapter number four.

404
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,259
What must I do?

405
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:14,339
How should I respond to this warning when God tells me this word that my heart is deceitful

406
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,339
above all things?

407
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:21,939
When he tells me that I'm to take heed that my heart be not deceived, and I recognize

408
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:27,779
that the New Testament, as we studied last week, tons of Scriptures that we referenced

409
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,979
last week that say, hey listen, they lie in wait to deceive, right?

410
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:36,199
They're deceiving and they're being deceived and we understand that we're living in this

411
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:39,219
age of deception and so therefore what must I do?

412
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,859
Well I believe that I must keep my heart.

413
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,099
Notice in verse number 23 of Proverbs 4, it's a very simple verse of Scripture, but the

414
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:54,699
Bible says this, keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of

415
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,579
life.

416
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,499
Keep thy heart with all diligence.

417
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:03,619
The word keep is an interesting word, it means to guard or to watch, but it really goes even

418
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,619
further than that.

419
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:15,259
It means to guard from dangers, but it also means this, to guard with fidelity, with loyalty,

420
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,259
with faithfulness.

421
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:22,179
And so when I begin to notice what he says here, why is he saying keep thy heart with

422
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:23,179
all diligence?

423
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:29,099
Why is there an emphasis of guarding our hearts and to watch them, to guard them from

424
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:32,299
danger, to guard it with fidelity?

425
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,699
Why does he tell us that?

426
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:36,059
Well because of out of it are the issues of life.

427
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,739
Well because it's deceitful and so therefore I must guard my heart and how do I do that?

428
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,819
I've got to get in the Word of God.

429
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,619
There are times in which as we go through life, as we live here on this earth, that

430
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,539
we face decisions and we have things that are before us and we know there are people

431
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,539
that are lying in wait to deceive us and we know that it's a bad idea to follow our heart,

432
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,099
we must get in to the Word of God.

433
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:05,939
I keep my heart, I guard it from the dangers and with fidelity.

434
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:10,899
Trust in the Lord, what's he saying in chapter number 3, with all thine heart, lean not unto

435
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:16,179
thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths.

436
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,979
By the way, I want him directing my path, don't you?

437
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,979
Amen?

438
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,339
I need to follow his Word.

439
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,699
I trust in the Lord and I follow his Word.

440
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,779
Let's look at Psalm 119 as we kind of finish up this evening and I want to just point out

441
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:37,179
a few verses here in the beginning, a couple of stanzas of Psalm 119 as we finish up this

442
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:42,499
evening and really looking at how we would respond to this warning that is issued.

443
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:47,939
Listen, when you've been reminded of the blessings, when God is revealing what he's going to do

444
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:53,539
and he says, take heed, when you're dealing with all of those blessings that your heart

445
00:24:53,539 --> 00:25:00,819
be not deceived, it leads me to believe that there's a potential for being vulnerable at

446
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:04,579
that time, right?

447
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:07,899
It's interesting, I know you're in Psalm 119, I don't want you to turn back to Deuteronomy

448
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:12,779
because I need to finish there, but it's interesting because in Deuteronomy chapter number 6, the

449
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,499
passage that I preached last Sunday morning, he gives all of that instruction about teaching

450
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:21,419
your children and so on and so forth, but then he says when you have houses that are

451
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,179
full of good things and you filled it not, you have wells that are digged that you didn't

452
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:31,139
dig and vineyards and oliveyards that you didn't plant and you're eating from it, then

453
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:33,299
beware lest thou forget the Lord.

454
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,299
That's Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 12.

455
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,299
Why in that moment?

456
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,739
Well, because we're increased with goods and have need of nothing.

457
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:48,139
Unfortunately, at times that even means God, if we're not careful.

458
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:51,899
Say, I got this.

459
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:58,259
In Psalm 119, notice verse number 2, blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that

460
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,339
seek him, how?

461
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,099
With the whole heart.

462
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,099
Look at verse number 10.

463
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,499
So it's interesting if you notice in verse number 2, the psalmist says, blessed are they

464
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:13,339
that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart.

465
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,219
He's looking at those that are doing these things and he's saying they're blessed because

466
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:18,819
of these actions.

467
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:24,579
And then in verse number 10, he says, with my whole heart, have I sought they?

468
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:28,619
Oh, let me not wander from thy commandments.

469
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,419
Thy word have I hid where?

470
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,419
In mine heart.

471
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:32,419
Why?

472
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:37,259
For I might not sin against thee.

473
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,939
This evening, we're living in an age of deception.

474
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:47,739
And there is a danger, there is a warning that is given to us.

475
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:54,939
Moses is being used by the Lord to instruct the people of God and he says, take heed to

476
00:26:54,939 --> 00:27:02,459
yourselves that your heart be not deceived.

477
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:10,259
I don't need to have an open mind to all of the new age ideas and all of the craziness

478
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,659
that our society and our culture wants to pump down our throats.

479
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,859
I just need to know what God says on the subject.

480
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,259
Amen?

481
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:24,779
I just need to know what God says.

482
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,939
I don't need to be gullible and naive.

483
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,299
I want to take heed.

484
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,499
I don't want to have a deceived heart.

485
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:40,499
And it's absolutely essential that we understand that when we hear so often, just follow your

486
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,339
heart.

487
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:44,979
That's bad counsel.

488
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:47,459
That's not biblical.

489
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:53,339
We follow the Lord and we follow His word because our hearts are deceitful above all

490
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,379
things.

491
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:59,899
And there are many that lie in wait to deceive.

492
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:05,619
Remember in Crete, as I mentioned in the book of Titus last Wednesday evening, that in that

493
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:12,419
small island, there were many deceivers.

494
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:17,299
In a small island, many deceivers.

495
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,059
Our land is littered with deceivers.

496
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:27,579
And by the way, for some reason, they very regularly get microphones and have platforms

497
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:32,879
and audiences, right?

498
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:38,699
The tool is often used by the enemy, the tool of deception.

499
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:44,419
Tonight, we need to take heed unto ourselves that our heart be not deceived.

500
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:45,419
Let's pray.

501
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,499
Father, how we thank you for the warnings that you give us in your word.

502
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:55,659
We understand the word of God has revealed to us the danger of deception, the age of

503
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,419
deception in which we're living in.

504
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:04,459
I pray tonight, as we look at this thought of our heart being deceived, that you would

505
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:12,379
help us, Lord, to keep, to guard our hearts with all diligence.

506
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:14,139
That we'd hide your word in our heart.

507
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:20,819
That we would be biblically minded, not open-minded.

508
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,419
That we would get into your word and allow your word to get into us, so that we would

509
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,819
think and act biblically.

510
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,499
That we could give an answer of the hope that lieth within us.

511
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:36,819
Help us, Lord, to take heed to the warning.

512
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,499
Bless our time of prayer.

513
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:43,739
We thank you for the privilege of prayer, which in Christ's name we pray, amen.

514
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:46,139
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

515
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,899
You did not get one on your way in, and you need one?
