WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.000
is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.200
When I know what God says, it enables me to boldly say, the Lord is my helper, I shall

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.360
not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.959
That was free tonight, amen?

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:35.139
Deuteronomy chapter number 11, and we'll be looking here at the first 17 verses of

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:36.139
Deuteronomy 11.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:41.319
Of course, last week, as you know, we started a mini-series that I entitled, The Danger

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:42.520
of Deception.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.959
I am thoroughly convinced that we are currently living in an age of deception.

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:54.639
I believe that as we look around our world, that it is not too difficult for any of us

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.159
to recognize that we are living in an age of deception.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.720
In fact, as we study the Word of God, we find that our God has graciously warned us about

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.580
the reality of deception.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.099
He told us that it was going to be the case.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:15.720
Not only did He warn us about the deception that we would face, but I am very thankful

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.440
that He has given us the truth of His Word, He has provided us with the remedy for deception.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:30.000
What a blessing to know and to have the Word of God and to know the truth.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What a blessing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.959
We will recall that as we began our series last Wednesday evening, that I mentioned to

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:43.599
you, and it is worth pointing out again this evening, that the tool of deception has been

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.559
in the adversary's toolbox since the Garden.

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:55.319
We understand that it is a tool that he regularly uses, the tool of deception.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.919
It's in his toolbox and he uses it often, and we find that no doubt, even in the age

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.639
in which we're living, we are facing great deception.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:11.960
If you're taking notes this evening, the title for the message is from verse number 16.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.039
I'll read that verse.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.479
For sake of time, I won't read all 17 verses.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.080
We'll read them as we go through.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.160
But in verse number 16, the Bible says this,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.119
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.619
And you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them.

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:34.520
So the title for the message this evening, that your heart be not deceived.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.880
That your heart be not deceived.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.479
I believe as we look at the book of Deuteronomy that we're mindful that God is preparing His

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.740
people for the entrance into the land of promise.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:53.179
We understand that God had many years before given this promise that His people would enter

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.860
into the land of promise.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.539
And as we study and read the book of Deuteronomy, we find that God is using Moses to prepare

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.339
the children of Israel for entrance into the land, reminding them of many things.

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:12.860
And as we understand the context here in Deuteronomy chapter number 11, we find that the first 15

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.860
verses are rich.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:20.660
I mean, the first 15 verses of Deuteronomy chapter number 11 are really a reminder to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.419
the people of what God has done and then revealing to the people what God will do for them.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.500
And it's exciting.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500
Look at it in verse number 1.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.899
Therefore, thou shalt love the Lord thy God and keep His charge and His statutes and His

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:42.899
judgments and His commandments always.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.619
It's not a temporary thing.

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:49.220
It was a command given to them for the longevity.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.940
It says this, and know ye this day for I speak not with your children which have not known

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.899
and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, His greatness, His mighty

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:07.779
hand and His stretched out arm and His miracles and His acts which He did in the midst of

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:13.419
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt and unto all His land.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.739
And what He did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses and their chariots, how He made

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.019
the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.739
hath destroyed them unto this day.

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:32.660
Notice in these first four verses, we find this reminder again of the mighty acts of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.019
God and what He did.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.899
You think about as the Word of God is being given and as the minds of the people as they're

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:46.339
hearing the words, they're going all the way back to the time in Egypt when God performed

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:53.459
the miracles, the plagues, and then He's dealing in verse number 4 with the crossing over the

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:00.459
Red Sea and we find that this reminder of the miracles and the acts of God, it's encouraging

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.920
to be reminded of what God has done.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.260
He says in verse number 5, and what He did unto you in the wilderness until you came

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.640
into this place, and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.799
how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:22.720
and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.359
Now you understand that verse number 6 is really a word of warning, is it not?

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:32.519
This is, remember in verse number 2, He says that you've seen the chastisement of the Lord

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.239
but you've also seen His greatness and His mighty hand, His stretched out arm.

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:41.959
We understand that the Bible teaches us, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth, and they saw

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.540
the chastisement, they saw the judgment.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.839
What is mentioned here in verse number 6 with Dathan and Abiram is the judgment of God.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.700
What a great warning and a great reminder, in fact, Paul will reference some of those

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.880
types of things like what we see in verse number 6 in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880
Notice in verse number 7,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.760
But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which He did.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.559
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.640
be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it, and that ye may prolong

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.160
your days in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.579
their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey.

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:29.739
For the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:35.380
ye came out, where thou sowest thy seed, and waterest it with thy foot as a garden

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.380
of herbs.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.940
But the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.019
water of the rain of heaven, a land, notice this in verse number 12, a land which the

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:50.100
Lord thy God careth for.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.179
The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:56.619
the end of the year.

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:00.920
And it shall come to pass, and then notice this word, if.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.179
It shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:10.660
you this day, to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.140
all your soul, that I will give you the rain of your land in His due season.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.179
The first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:23.339
thine oil.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:28.260
And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.399
That sounds good, doesn't it?

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.140
God is telling them this is what I've done for you and God is saying this is what I'm

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.660
going to do for you as you obey me, as you follow me, as you hearken to me, that I'm

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.660
going to do these things.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.100
And these are fabulous, wonderful things.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:53.140
And then we get to verse number 16 and he says, take heed to yourselves that your heart

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.980
be not deceived.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:01.380
And ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.779
Do you know this actually happened to the children of Israel?

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.799
Their heart was deceived and they followed idols.

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:15.640
It says in verse number 17, and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and He

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.760
shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.320
ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.040
Focus our attention on verse number 16.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.659
It's interesting to me as we look at the context of Deuteronomy 11 and we understand the place

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.919
of the warning.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:45.539
It's in the time of the blessing of God and a time in which God is doing what He said

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:52.080
that He would do and He says, take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.359
The heart we find as we look throughout the Word of God, God's Word says much to us about

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:01.080
the heart and we can look at a number of passages.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.719
We will not have time this evening to do that, but we find the Bible talks about a hard heart,

00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:10.820
a proud heart, a pure heart, an understanding heart, just to mention a few.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.479
And there are many references to the heart.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:19.599
It's been defined as the seat of the affections and passions, the seat of the understanding,

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:21.500
the seat of the will.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.239
You'll be mindful that it was God in Genesis chapter number 6, you don't need to turn there,

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:33.000
but He's speaking to Noah and talking about the judgment that would come with regard to

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:38.960
the wickedness God saw in verse number 5 of Genesis 6, that the wickedness of man was

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.960
great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:55.000
We think about this warning in Deuteronomy 11 and really we couple it with what Jeremiah

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.919
proclaims in Jeremiah 17 in verse number 9 when he says,

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.999
The heart is deceitful above all things,

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:07.739
and desperately wicked.

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.999
Who can know it?

00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:13.279
The answer is given in v. 10 of Jeremiah 17.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.939
I, the Lord, search the heart.

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:15.979
I try the rains,

00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:17.979
even to give every man according to his ways

00:10:17.979 --> 00:10:20.179
and according to the fruit of his doing.

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:21.939
But in the idea this evening

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:23.619
that your heart be not deceived,

00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:27.259
we recognize that God is telling His people

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.459
and telling us through preservation

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:33.339
that the heart is deceitful above all things,

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:35.279
and desperately wicked.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:38.579
Who can know it?

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:41.059
He says that your heart be not deceived.

00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:43.599
It's interesting back in Deuteronomy 11

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:45.399
in v. 16 when He says

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.619
that your heart be not deceived,

00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:51.739
the Hebrew word there that is translated deceived,

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:53.979
it carries with it the idea of being

00:10:53.979 --> 00:11:00.799
simple, naïve, gullible.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:04.139
But this is the one that hit me the most.

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:07.099
Open-minded.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.299
Open-minded.

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:09.759
Why does it hit me the most?

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:12.679
Well, because how often do we hear people today say,

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:15.759
you just need to be open-minded?

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.699
Right?

00:11:16.699 --> 00:11:17.979
We hear it all the time.

00:11:17.979 --> 00:11:18.999
We hear people say,

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.339
oh, you just need to broaden your horizon.

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:23.459
You just need to be more open-minded

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:25.259
and you need to be more inclusive

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:26.899
and so on and so forth.

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:28.899
You need to be open-minded.

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:31.979
And when they use that phraseology,

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:34.259
oftentimes what they'll do is they'll say,

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:37.979
you are just narrow-minded.

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:40.439
That's the opposite of being open-minded

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:41.859
is being narrow-minded.

00:11:41.859 --> 00:11:44.139
And we've been accused of being narrow-minded.

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.019
And often I've said I can only be

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:49.019
as wide as my Bible is. Amen?

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.539
And we're going to be as narrow

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:52.459
as the Word of God is. Why?

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:55.179
As a preacher from yesteryear said,

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:57.619
never, or let me put it this way,

00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:58.459
this is how he said it,

00:11:58.459 --> 00:11:59.899
where God puts a period,

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:01.499
don't put a question mark.

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:03.339
What's he saying?

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:05.219
Just trust God's Word.

00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:06.219
It's not necessary.

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:10.499
Listen, God understood as He gave us the Word of God,

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:12.499
He is the eternal God,

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:13.939
Alpha and Omega,

00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:15.219
the first and the last,

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:16.459
the beginning and the end.

00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:18.739
He understood the cultures

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:22.379
and the various aspects of thoughts

00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:24.139
that human beings would have.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.939
It's nothing new.

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:27.819
We see all the way back in Genesis 6,

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:30.859
the reason that I use that passage of Scripture

00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:33.819
to talk about the heart being wicked,

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:37.139
this idea of deception that began in the garden

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:38.939
in Genesis chapter number three.

00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:42.779
And he says that we need to take heed to yourselves

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:45.059
that your heart be not deceived.

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.739
And the word means to be simple,

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:49.139
to be naive, to be gullible,

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:51.539
or to be open-minded.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.859
I understand that we're living in a time,

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.459
in an era, in a generation,

00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:59.779
when it's popular that people are saying

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.859
you just need to be open-minded.

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:04.779
You need to consider other ways of thinking.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:09.339
You need to understand and consider other perspectives.

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:11.339
Why would I leave the truth

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:13.699
for something that's less than truth?

00:13:14.939 --> 00:13:17.739
It doesn't really make sense, does it?

00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:21.339
And so if God has given us the truth,

00:13:21.339 --> 00:13:23.139
and He has,

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.739
and we hold the Scriptures in our hands,

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:27.099
and we have the truth,

00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:29.459
I don't need to be open-minded

00:13:29.459 --> 00:13:31.379
to all of the new ideas

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:34.779
and all of the ideas that our world would have.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:38.539
No, I need to have the mind of Christ.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.379
Amen?

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:42.579
Here's what Paul says in the book of Philippians.

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:45.059
He says, let this mind be in you,

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:47.939
which was also in Christ Jesus,

00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:50.259
in Philippians 2, in verse number five.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:52.659
And we find it in the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:55.619
He talks about that we have the mind of Christ.

00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:58.099
To know God is to know His word.

00:13:58.099 --> 00:14:00.379
And we understand that God has given.

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:03.779
In fact, throughout the chapter of Deuteronomy 11,

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.779
as we've read through these first 17 verses,

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.299
we see that there are many references

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.539
to the importance of keeping the commandments

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:12.139
and following the commandments.

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:14.459
In verses 18, 19, and 20,

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:17.179
I will not have time to read those verses,

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.539
but it's very similar to the text of Scripture

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:20.979
that I preached on Sunday morning

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:23.619
from Deuteronomy chapter number six.

00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:26.979
The importance of the commands of the Lord

00:14:26.979 --> 00:14:29.099
and His statutes and His judgments.

00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:31.259
And we find that here,

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:34.339
the word of God is to have a prominent place in our lives.

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:38.259
And when God's word has that prominent place in our lives,

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:42.059
that is really the key that we would not have,

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:44.979
that our hearts would not be deceived.

00:14:45.979 --> 00:14:51.299
As I think about the warning that is given here,

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.259
I'm mindful of Jeremiah once again.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:57.299
Turn over to Jeremiah 44, if you will.

00:14:57.299 --> 00:14:59.579
We referenced already in Jeremiah 17

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:02.939
the way in which the Bible tells us

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:05.819
that the heart is deceitful above all things.

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:08.699
And Jeremiah 44,

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:12.059
you'll find that in this passage of Scripture,

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:15.659
there's some dialogue that takes place.

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:18.019
And I just want to read a few verses of Scripture to you

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:23.099
to help you see the deception of these people.

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:24.699
God says this in verse number three,

00:15:24.699 --> 00:15:26.499
because of their wickedness which they have committed

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:29.699
to provoke Me to anger in that they went to burn incense

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:32.339
and to serve other gods whom they knew not,

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:35.419
neither they, ye, nor your fathers.

00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:37.819
Howbeit, I sent unto you all My servants,

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:39.579
the prophets, rising early,

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:40.699
and sending them, saying,

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:44.019
O, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

00:15:44.019 --> 00:15:48.619
Isn't God so gracious in longsuffering?

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:49.979
They forsook the Lord.

00:15:49.979 --> 00:15:51.339
They forgot the Lord.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:53.299
They followed after idols.

00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:55.859
But God in His grace and His mercy

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:57.299
and His longsuffering,

00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:58.619
He sent prophets,

00:15:58.619 --> 00:16:01.299
and He sent those prophets faithfully.

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:02.739
Jeremiah, one of them.

00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:04.579
But notice what it says in verse number eight,

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:07.459
But they hearkened not,

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:10.179
or inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness

00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:12.659
to burn no incense unto other gods.

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:15.899
Wherefore, My fury and Mine anger was poured forth

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:18.099
and was kindled in the cities of Judah

00:16:18.099 --> 00:16:19.819
and in the streets of Jerusalem,

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:24.499
and they are wasted and desolate as at this day.

00:16:24.499 --> 00:16:27.259
What did God say back in Deuteronomy 11?

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:30.459
He said that if you had a deceived heart

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:32.979
and you followed after other gods,

00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:36.099
that He would withhold the rain.

00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:38.499
Remember, He said, if you obey Me,

00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:39.579
if you keep these commandments,

00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:40.779
I'm gonna send the rain,

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:42.699
the former and the latter rain.

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:44.899
I'm gonna bless and I'm gonna,

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:47.659
God controls, listen, there's no mother nature.

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:50.019
It's God that's controlling, amen.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:54.899
He is the creator and the sustainer of all things.

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:57.899
And we find here that as you skip down

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:00.379
and look at verse number 16, if you will,

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:02.139
as the word of the Lord then came,

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:04.779
it says, as for the word that thou has spoken unto us

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:05.979
in the name of the Lord,

00:17:05.979 --> 00:17:07.659
we will not hearken unto thee.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:10.619
And so, Jeremiah takes them a message.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.499
They had requested of Jeremiah

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.739
to seek the face of God on their behalf,

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:17.059
and Jeremiah faithfully does that,

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:19.539
and God faithfully answers Jeremiah,

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.579
and Jeremiah delivers that message,

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.939
and they say, we're not gonna hearken unto thee.

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:26.419
By the way, they had made a commitment

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:29.139
when they initially requested Jeremiah

00:17:29.139 --> 00:17:32.299
to go on their behalf and to get the word from God,

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:34.939
that whatever He says, we will do.

00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:37.739
And then he brought back the message,

00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:40.459
and they said, no, that's not right.

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:42.579
We're not gonna hearken to that.

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:43.419
It says this.

00:17:43.419 --> 00:17:44.259
Notice what they say.

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:46.939
This is a deceived heart.

00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:51.939
But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth

00:17:52.659 --> 00:17:55.739
out of our own mouth to burn incense

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:57.819
unto the queen of heaven,

00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:00.939
and to pour out drink offerings unto her,

00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:03.539
as we have done, we and our fathers,

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:05.299
our kings and our princes,

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:08.299
in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:11.219
For then had we plenty of vittles,

00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:15.099
and were well, and saw no evil.

00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:21.059
God's grace and God's mercy and God's long-suffering

00:18:22.699 --> 00:18:25.339
was misinterpreted by the people of God

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:27.019
as being God's approval,

00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:30.459
that God was okay with their behavior,

00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:33.700
because God didn't immediately judge them.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.700
They thought, man, when we were serving these idols

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.579
and pouring these things out to the queen of heaven,

00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:40.619
we had plenty.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.059
We didn't have all these problems.

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:44.619
We have the problems that you're dealing with now

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:46.380
because God's judgment came.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.579
And instead of them turning to God,

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:51.419
they said, you know what?

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:54.779
We're just gonna keep on doing what we did before.

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:56.299
Man, that's terrible.

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:02.299
And God tells us in Deuteronomy 11, take heed,

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:03.859
and here's what he says,

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:07.619
take heed that your heart be not deceived.

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:09.419
How many times have you heard somebody say,

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:11.940
I mentioned about hearing people say all the time

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.899
in the culture and the society in which we're living

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:16.380
that we need to be open-minded and we've dealt with that,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.859
but I want you to consider this.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:20.700
How many times do you hear people say, follow your heart?

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.539
You've heard people say that?

00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:25.979
Do you know that's a bad idea?

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:28.539
Honestly.

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:30.019
You know why it's a bad idea?

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:32.099
Turn to the book of Proverbs, if you will.

00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:34.579
Proverbs chapter 28.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.619
It's not a bad idea because I'm saying it's a bad idea.

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:43.899
It's a bad idea because God told us it was a bad idea.

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:45.539
Amen?

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:49.139
Because our heart is deceitful above all things.

00:19:49.139 --> 00:19:51.739
I've heard people say, follow your heart.

00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:53.179
I'm just following my heart.

00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:54.859
I've heard people say, I'm following my gut.

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:57.579
I'm not sure that's a good idea either.

00:19:57.579 --> 00:20:00.139
But the reality is that you hear this thing about.

00:20:00.139 --> 00:20:02.199
following your heart.

00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:04.159
But notice what it says in Proverbs 28.

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:05.599
Look in verse number 25.

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:11.239
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife.

00:20:11.239 --> 00:20:12.239
But notice what it says.

00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:16.799
He that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.879
Continue, verse 26.

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:26.479
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.

00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:28.079
Is that what your Bible says?

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:30.319
I'm not making it up, amen?

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:32.079
That's what the Word of God says.

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:35.359
But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:40.359
Do you see the contrast in verses 25 and 26 between the one that puts his trust in the

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:44.799
Lord versus the one that's trusting in his own heart?

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:48.599
Your heart and my heart can deceive us.

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.399
It's not about me following my heart.

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.519
It's about me following the Lord.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:55.759
We sang tonight about following the Lord.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:57.979
Anywhere with Jesus, I can go, right?

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:00.019
As I follow him.

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:05.619
And we find here that we trust in him, and as we put our trust in the Lord, it says that

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:11.619
he shall be made fat, but if we trust in our own heart, we're a fool.

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:13.859
Why does he say that?

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:16.899
Because the heart is deceitful.

00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:23.419
And he gives the warning to his people in Deuteronomy 11, preserved for us, take heed

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:25.419
that your heart be not deceived.

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:28.179
You say, oh man, my heart's not going to be deceived.

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:31.219
I can trust my heart.

00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:37.459
First Corinthians 11 says, let he that thinketh he stand, take heed lest he fall, amen?

00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:41.219
I think it's verse 12 in First Corinthians 11, verse 12.

00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:48.019
And so the reality is that we must take heed to the warning that God gives us.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:49.499
How do we respond to the warning?

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:53.499
Well, he says take heed in the verse of Scripture in chapter 11 and verse 16 of the book of

00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:54.499
Deuteronomy.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.699
And I mentioned that last week because that's what Jesus said as well.

00:21:57.699 --> 00:22:00.939
It means to see, to discern, to beware.

00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:02.179
I believe this.

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:04.979
Turn back, you're in the book of Proverbs right now, turn back to the fourth chapter

00:22:04.979 --> 00:22:08.019
if you will, chapter number four.

00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:09.259
What must I do?

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:14.339
How should I respond to this warning when God tells me this word that my heart is deceitful

00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:15.339
above all things?

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:21.939
When he tells me that I'm to take heed that my heart be not deceived, and I recognize

00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:27.779
that the New Testament, as we studied last week, tons of Scriptures that we referenced

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:31.979
last week that say, hey listen, they lie in wait to deceive, right?

00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:36.199
They're deceiving and they're being deceived and we understand that we're living in this

00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:39.219
age of deception and so therefore what must I do?

00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:41.859
Well I believe that I must keep my heart.

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:46.099
Notice in verse number 23 of Proverbs 4, it's a very simple verse of Scripture, but the

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:54.699
Bible says this, keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of

00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:56.579
life.

00:22:56.579 --> 00:22:58.499
Keep thy heart with all diligence.

00:22:58.499 --> 00:23:03.619
The word keep is an interesting word, it means to guard or to watch, but it really goes even

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:04.619
further than that.

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:15.259
It means to guard from dangers, but it also means this, to guard with fidelity, with loyalty,

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:16.259
with faithfulness.

00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:22.179
And so when I begin to notice what he says here, why is he saying keep thy heart with

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:23.179
all diligence?

00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:29.099
Why is there an emphasis of guarding our hearts and to watch them, to guard them from

00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:32.299
danger, to guard it with fidelity?

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:33.699
Why does he tell us that?

00:23:33.699 --> 00:23:36.059
Well because of out of it are the issues of life.

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:40.739
Well because it's deceitful and so therefore I must guard my heart and how do I do that?

00:23:40.739 --> 00:23:43.819
I've got to get in the Word of God.

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:48.619
There are times in which as we go through life, as we live here on this earth, that

00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:52.539
we face decisions and we have things that are before us and we know there are people

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:56.539
that are lying in wait to deceive us and we know that it's a bad idea to follow our heart,

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:59.099
we must get in to the Word of God.

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:05.939
I keep my heart, I guard it from the dangers and with fidelity.

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:10.899
Trust in the Lord, what's he saying in chapter number 3, with all thine heart, lean not unto

00:24:10.899 --> 00:24:16.179
thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths.

00:24:16.179 --> 00:24:20.979
By the way, I want him directing my path, don't you?

00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:22.979
Amen?

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:25.339
I need to follow his Word.

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:27.699
I trust in the Lord and I follow his Word.

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:31.779
Let's look at Psalm 119 as we kind of finish up this evening and I want to just point out

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:37.179
a few verses here in the beginning, a couple of stanzas of Psalm 119 as we finish up this

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:42.499
evening and really looking at how we would respond to this warning that is issued.

00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:47.939
Listen, when you've been reminded of the blessings, when God is revealing what he's going to do

00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:53.539
and he says, take heed, when you're dealing with all of those blessings that your heart

00:24:53.539 --> 00:25:00.819
be not deceived, it leads me to believe that there's a potential for being vulnerable at

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:04.579
that time, right?

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:07.899
It's interesting, I know you're in Psalm 119, I don't want you to turn back to Deuteronomy

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:12.779
because I need to finish there, but it's interesting because in Deuteronomy chapter number 6, the

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:17.499
passage that I preached last Sunday morning, he gives all of that instruction about teaching

00:25:17.499 --> 00:25:21.419
your children and so on and so forth, but then he says when you have houses that are

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:26.179
full of good things and you filled it not, you have wells that are digged that you didn't

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:31.139
dig and vineyards and oliveyards that you didn't plant and you're eating from it, then

00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:33.299
beware lest thou forget the Lord.

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:35.299
That's Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 12.

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:36.299
Why in that moment?

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:41.739
Well, because we're increased with goods and have need of nothing.

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:48.139
Unfortunately, at times that even means God, if we're not careful.

00:25:48.139 --> 00:25:51.899
Say, I got this.

00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:58.259
In Psalm 119, notice verse number 2, blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:00.339
seek him, how?

00:26:00.339 --> 00:26:03.099
With the whole heart.

00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:05.099
Look at verse number 10.

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:09.499
So it's interesting if you notice in verse number 2, the psalmist says, blessed are they

00:26:09.499 --> 00:26:13.339
that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart.

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:17.219
He's looking at those that are doing these things and he's saying they're blessed because

00:26:17.219 --> 00:26:18.819
of these actions.

00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:24.579
And then in verse number 10, he says, with my whole heart, have I sought they?

00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:28.619
Oh, let me not wander from thy commandments.

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:30.419
Thy word have I hid where?

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:31.419
In mine heart.

00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:32.419
Why?

00:26:32.739 --> 00:26:37.259
For I might not sin against thee.

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:41.939
This evening, we're living in an age of deception.

00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:47.739
And there is a danger, there is a warning that is given to us.

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:54.939
Moses is being used by the Lord to instruct the people of God and he says, take heed to

00:26:54.939 --> 00:27:02.459
yourselves that your heart be not deceived.

00:27:02.459 --> 00:27:10.259
I don't need to have an open mind to all of the new age ideas and all of the craziness

00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:14.659
that our society and our culture wants to pump down our throats.

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:18.859
I just need to know what God says on the subject.

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:21.259
Amen?

00:27:21.259 --> 00:27:24.779
I just need to know what God says.

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:28.939
I don't need to be gullible and naive.

00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:30.299
I want to take heed.

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:33.499
I don't want to have a deceived heart.

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:40.499
And it's absolutely essential that we understand that when we hear so often, just follow your

00:27:40.499 --> 00:27:42.339
heart.

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:44.979
That's bad counsel.

00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.459
That's not biblical.

00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:53.339
We follow the Lord and we follow His word because our hearts are deceitful above all

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:55.379
things.

00:27:55.379 --> 00:27:59.899
And there are many that lie in wait to deceive.

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:05.619
Remember in Crete, as I mentioned in the book of Titus last Wednesday evening, that in that

00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:12.419
small island, there were many deceivers.

00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:17.299
In a small island, many deceivers.

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:21.059
Our land is littered with deceivers.

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:27.579
And by the way, for some reason, they very regularly get microphones and have platforms

00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:32.879
and audiences, right?

00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:38.699
The tool is often used by the enemy, the tool of deception.

00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:44.419
Tonight, we need to take heed unto ourselves that our heart be not deceived.

00:28:44.419 --> 00:28:45.419
Let's pray.

00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:50.499
Father, how we thank you for the warnings that you give us in your word.

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:55.659
We understand the word of God has revealed to us the danger of deception, the age of

00:28:55.659 --> 00:28:58.419
deception in which we're living in.

00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:04.459
I pray tonight, as we look at this thought of our heart being deceived, that you would

00:29:04.459 --> 00:29:12.379
help us, Lord, to keep, to guard our hearts with all diligence.

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:14.139
That we'd hide your word in our heart.

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:20.819
That we would be biblically minded, not open-minded.

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:26.419
That we would get into your word and allow your word to get into us, so that we would

00:29:26.419 --> 00:29:29.819
think and act biblically.

00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:34.499
That we could give an answer of the hope that lieth within us.

00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:36.819
Help us, Lord, to take heed to the warning.

00:29:36.819 --> 00:29:38.499
Bless our time of prayer.

00:29:38.499 --> 00:29:43.739
We thank you for the privilege of prayer, which in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:46.139
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:47.899
You did not get one on your way in, and you need one?
