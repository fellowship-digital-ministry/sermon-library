1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
In verse number seven, we started here this morning,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,159
we're gonna start here again this evening.

3
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:07,539
And I am so thankful for the Word of God,

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:10,720
thankful for the truth contained therein.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,560
And as I said this morning,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,680
we're reminded of just how precious our God is.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,319
And I am so thankful that we have this book

8
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,879
that reveals these wonderful truths to us.

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,159
In verse number seven,

10
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,840
I read the first seven verses this morning.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
I'm just gonna jump right into verse number seven.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,959
This evening, to remind you of the text,

13
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,880
it says this, unto you therefore,

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,119
which believe he is precious.

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,119
And we said this morning that that word precious,

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,979
it means of the honor which one has by reason of rank

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,759
and state of office which he holds.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,159
As we considered the thought this morning,

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,919
we said that we're thankful for his person, for who he is,

20
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,419
thankful for his presence,

21
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,139
the fact that he said I will never leave thee

22
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:01,659
nor forsake thee.

23
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,459
This evening, as we continue our thought

24
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,980
with he is precious,

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,459
I wanna look at some promises

26
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,180
that he's given us in his Word.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,779
And it's interesting if you turn over to 2 Peter,

28
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,779
just a few pages over and look in the first chapter,

29
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,940
you begin to see the introduction here

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,860
and notice what is said in verse number three.

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,459
According as his divine power hath given unto us

32
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,699
all things that pertain unto life and godliness,

33
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,500
through the knowledge of him that hath called us

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,059
to glory and virtue,

35
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,660
notice verse number four,

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,819
whereby are given unto us

37
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,819
exceeding great and precious promises.

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,580
That by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,000
having escaped the corruption that is in the world

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,839
through lust.

41
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,860
In 2 Corinthians 1 and verse number 20,

42
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,180
we are told that all the promises of God in him are yea

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,019
and in him, amen,

44
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,379
under the glory of God by us,

45
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,940
all the promises of God in him are yea.

46
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,360
And I'm so thankful that God has given us promises

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,580
in his Word.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,000
And someone said this,

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,779
it's a statement from yesteryear

50
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:18,779
and it says, as the individual was speaking of promises,

51
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,179
it says this, the individual noted,

52
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:26,000
a promise is only as good as the person who makes it.

53
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,419
We understand that to be the case, correct?

54
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,539
And a promise is only as good as the person who makes it.

55
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,339
The character of the promiser

56
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:40,500
is what gives the promise its value.

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,940
Now think about that.

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,339
The character of the promiser,

59
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,619
the one who's making the promises,

60
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,699
the character of that individual

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,020
is what gives the promise its value.

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,179
Now we mentioned here that Peter says

63
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,100
in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4,

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,300
whereby are given unto us exceeding great

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,740
and precious promises.

66
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,820
The thought continues and says,

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,619
the promises of God are meant to ignite faith,

68
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,580
expectation and desire,

69
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,619
and then to point us to him.

70
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,220
And you think about the way that the promises of God

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,259
should ignite faith in us and expectation

72
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,979
and should cause us to draw closer to him.

73
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:31,979
His promises act to bind our hearts to his.

74
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,860
The song says, every promise of the book is mine.

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,660
And what a blessing to think about the many promises

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,619
that are contained within the Word of God.

77
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,979
Numbers 23 and verse number 19 tells us

78
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,619
that God is not a man that he should lie.

79
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,059
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

80
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:51,899
He's trustworthy.

81
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,899
He's dependable.

82
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,460
He is truth.

83
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,660
And he's given us many, many promises.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,220
And these promises are indeed exceeding great and precious.

85
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,300
This evening I have a list of 15 promises

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,660
that I want to give you.

87
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,220
And the list is not exhaustive.

88
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,820
You can go and you can find many, many promises

89
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,619
within the Word of God.

90
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,779
I'm going to start with two promises

91
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,820
with regard to the Word of God.

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,700
And then if you follow, hopefully, the logic,

93
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,019
it makes as much sense to you as it does to me,

94
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm going to kind of begin at salvation

95
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,299
where we begin in promises that pertain

96
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:29,019
to our walk with God and eventually through eternity.

97
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,260
Consider this promise, the promise that God has given us

98
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,739
to preserve his Word.

99
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,660
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will,

100
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,459
in Psalm chapter number 12.

101
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,779
And I want you to notice a few verses of scripture here

102
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,540
with regard to the promise of preservation.

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,299
And the first two that I mentioned that we'll look at

104
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,779
are dealing with the Word of God.

105
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,260
The reason is because it's this book

106
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,779
that contains the promises.

107
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,820
And therefore, I thought it best that we would look

108
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,899
at some promises that God has given us

109
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,700
with regard to his Word,

110
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,500
so that we could use that as really foundation

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,739
for these other promises that we'll look to.

112
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,660
In Psalm 12, in verse number six, the Bible says,

113
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,619
"'The words of the Lord are pure words.

114
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:15,260
As silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

115
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,019
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord.

116
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:23,019
Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever.'"

117
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,140
And as you recall, this morning,

118
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,339
as we looked at the person of Jesus Christ,

119
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,019
being thankful for his person, who he is,

120
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,380
the very first thing that we mentioned

121
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,459
is he is Alpha and Omega, he's eternal.

122
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,820
And here we find that he's promised

123
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,220
that he would preserve his words,

124
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,140
these words that are pure words,

125
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,140
he's gonna preserve them from this generation forever.

126
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,459
And to be mindful of the fact this evening

127
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:52,660
that the eternal God has given us a promise

128
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,380
to preserve the precious Word of God

129
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,820
ought to cause us to rejoice

130
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,579
because I can have full confidence in faith

131
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,980
in what the Word of God says.

132
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,820
Why?

133
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,179
Because God said he was going to preserve it.

134
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,540
And since God said he was gonna preserve it

135
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,179
because God is trustworthy and dependable

136
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,660
and always does what he says he will do,

137
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,660
we can rest assured that God has indeed preserved his Word.

138
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,660
Notice, if you will, in Psalm 119 in verse number 89,

139
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,459
the Bible tells us, of course,

140
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,459
you're familiar with this chapter in Psalm 119

141
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,059
dealing with the Word of God

142
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,420
and all the wonderful characteristics

143
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,619
and the ways in which the psalmist

144
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:38,700
is relating to the Word of God and its place in his life.

145
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,339
And here in Psalm 119 in verse 89,

146
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,179
the Bible says,

147
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:47,179
forever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in heaven.

148
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,380
Forever.

149
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,140
His Word is settled in heaven.

150
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,980
Jesus said this in Matthew 24 in verse number 35

151
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,500
as he's speaking here and giving instruction,

152
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,940
he gives note with regard to the Word of God

153
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,179
and he says, heaven and earth shall pass away,

154
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:07,179
but my words shall not pass away.

155
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,700
There are people that are trying to revise the Bible.

156
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,459
They're trying to remove the Bible, right?

157
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,619
We live in a society in which they're trying to revise it,

158
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,100
they're trying to remove it,

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,579
but we find that God has promised

160
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,459
that he's going to preserve it.

161
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,540
And it doesn't matter, as we mentioned this morning,

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,779
our God is victorious.

163
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,660
It doesn't matter of the scheme and plan

164
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,019
of the evil one and the wicked one

165
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,739
to try to rid our society of this book.

166
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:41,459
God said that his Word was settled

167
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,779
and that his Word would not pass away.

168
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,579
He said that he would preserve it

169
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,579
from this generation forever.

170
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,739
And we can rejoice this evening that we have a Bible.

171
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,299
Not only did he promise to preserve his Word,

172
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:57,540
but I want you to consider that he promised to us

173
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,420
the power of his Word.

174
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,260
He promised that his Word was powerful and it works.

175
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,059
And now that encourages me because as a preacher,

176
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:09,540
I've been instructed to preach the Word.

177
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,820
And when we consider the place that the Bible has

178
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,059
in our lives as individuals,

179
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:19,260
we find that God has told us, listen, my Word is powerful.

180
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,660
My Word will accomplish what I desire for it to accomplish.

181
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,619
We're mindful of that very truth in Isaiah 55

182
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,619
and verse number 11,

183
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,980
where here the promise is given with regard

184
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,780
to the Word of God accomplishing its purpose.

185
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,460
Notice in Isaiah 55 and verse number 11,

186
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
the Bible says this,

187
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,739
so shall my Word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.

188
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:49,739
It shall not return unto me void,

189
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,700
but it shall accomplish that which I please

190
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,700
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

191
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,820
Aren't you thankful for that promise?

192
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,659
I mean, what a joy to understand.

193
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,539
Listen, when we give the Word of God,

194
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,260
we may not see the effects,

195
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,900
we may not see the results immediately,

196
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,780
but we can rest assured in what God has told us

197
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,859
about his Word and the purpose of his Word,

198
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,460
the power of his Word,

199
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,580
and we can rest that it will accomplish

200
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,619
what it's intended to accomplish.

201
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:24,099
Notice in 1 Thessalonians chapter number two,

202
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,780
as Paul is commending this church in Thessalonica

203
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
and he's speaking to them about the ways

204
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,940
in which they were growing and prospering

205
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,780
in their faith and their love,

206
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,700
and we find that he mentions to them specifically

207
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,619
in 1 Thessalonians two, in verse number 13,

208
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:45,260
the way in which God's Word had worked in their lives.

209
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,059
And it encourages us for understanding this evening

210
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:53,179
how God's Word continues to work in our lives.

211
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,539
Notice in verse 13 of 1 Thessalonians two,

212
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,140
the Bible says for this cause also,

213
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,780
thank we God without.

214
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:05,840
sing, because when you receive the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it

215
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,720
not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, notice, which effectually

216
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,560
worketh also in you that believe."

217
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,080
This evening we could take the time and go around the room and give testimony of how

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:30,720
God's Word has worked in our lives, how God's Word has been at work, the power of God's

219
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,120
Word accomplishing things in our lives as we study the Word of God, as we read and meditate

220
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
upon the Word of God, as we hear the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,080
It's through the preaching and teaching of the Word of God, the reading of the Word of

222
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,680
God, the receiving of God's Word that our faith increases.

223
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,600
It's through this book that I know my Savior, Paul says in Philippians 3, that I may know

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,400
Him and the power of His resurrection.

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,840
And if you want to know God, you need to know the Bible.

226
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,920
And I'm thankful that God has preserved it for us, and He's promised that it will work,

227
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,560
the power of His Word.

228
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,320
He said that His Word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword.

229
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,240
He said that His Word was profitable.

230
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,280
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, it works, and I'm so

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,720
thankful this evening for that truth.

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,480
As we consider the foundation of these promises that we'll look at quickly this evening, I

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,360
want you to understand that each promise that we look to this evening is found in this book,

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,100
and thus the foundation of understanding the preservation and the power of God's Word.

235
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,320
He promises this.

236
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,760
He promises to save us.

237
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,800
He promises to save us.

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm going to begin, as I mentioned, kind of the logic of these promises of really beginning

239
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
at salvation.

240
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,240
What a great song that we sang tonight, when heaven came down and glory filled my soul,

241
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,040
in understanding salvation and the day in which we trust that Christ is our Savior.

242
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,240
Romans 10 and verse number 13 is a verse of Scripture that many of us have committed to

243
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:15,320
memory, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,820
That's a promise, isn't it?

245
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,960
And what a joy.

246
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't know the number of people that I've told over the years that verse of Scripture

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,040
as I've had the unique privilege and opportunity to share the gospel with individuals, and

248
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,960
as I would speak to them about Christ and about what He did for them and what was accomplished

249
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,320
on the cross of Calvary, I'd say something like this.

250
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,840
He promises to save you if you just trust Him.

251
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,000
In fact, I believe that some of our literature, some of our door hangers, and some of our

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,960
brochures carry that very verbiage that He promises to save you if you simply ask Him.

253
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,360
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

254
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm thankful for that promise.

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:09,200
It was on August 31st, 1997, whatever that is, 24 years ago, a little over 24 years ago,

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,480
that I put my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, claiming that promise, claiming

257
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,360
that God promised that He'd save me if I'd call on Him, understanding that I was a sinner.

258
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,240
I was helpless and hopeless, just as you were, but I understood who He was and what He did,

259
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,240
and I understood that He promised, He said that the gift of God is eternal life through

260
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,680
Jesus Christ, our Lord, and I placed my faith and trust in Jesus Christ.

261
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,080
The Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter number 7 that wherefore He is able also to save them

262
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,080
to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession

263
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
for them.

264
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Listen, aren't you thankful that God promised to save you?

265
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,320
He didn't just promise to save you.

266
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,080
He uses us to share the gospel with others, and that promise extends to whosoever shall

267
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,560
call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and what a great promise.

268
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm so thankful for that promise.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,520
Not only did He promise to save us, He promised to empower us.

270
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
He promised to empower us.

271
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,560
I'm thankful this evening that I don't have to live the Christian life in my own flesh.

272
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,800
By the way, I can't, and neither can you.

273
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,000
You know what's so frustrating is when we try, when we try to live the Christian life

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,240
in our own power, in our own strength, and we try to live it in our own flesh, and it's

275
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,720
frustrating, but He promised that He would empower us.

276
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,720
We find in Acts 1.8 as He says to the disciples as they're there after they had heard this

277
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,360
great commission and before they would go, of course, to the ascension and then wait

278
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,200
for the promise of the Father.

279
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,600
We find that Jesus says, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

280
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm thankful for the empowering of Christ.

281
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm thankful that He's promised to empower us, that it's not in my flesh.

282
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Remember, Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.

283
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,600
For to will is present.

284
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,520
But then how do we accomplish that, right?

285
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,360
Oh, woe is me, oh wretched man that I am.

286
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,000
And we find here that He's promised to empower us that we're to be filled with the Spirit

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
of God.

288
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,920
Ephesians 5 and verse number 18, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled

289
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,400
with the Spirit of God.

290
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,520
And we understand that importance of daily being filled with His Spirit.

291
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,480
The Bible says in Galatians 5, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust

292
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,520
of the flesh.

293
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,240
The reality is that your flesh and my flesh has lust.

294
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Our flesh, our old nature, our sinful nature, that old man, it has desires, it has fleshly

295
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,280
desires, but the promise is that as we walk in the Spirit, we shall not fulfill the lust

296
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
of the flesh.

297
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Why?

298
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Because He empowers us.

299
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm so thankful that it's Christ in you, the hope of glory.

300
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,840
The reality is that He told us that we would have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of

301
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
God.

302
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,280
Remember what He said to the disciples when He said that He was going to depart.

303
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,120
He said, it's expedient for you that I go away.

304
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Why?

305
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,200
Because I'm going to send the Holy Spirit, I'm going to send the Comforter.

306
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,520
And we find that this evening at the moment of salvation, we trust Christ as our Savior,

307
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,800
that He empowers us and He dwells within us, and we have the power of God Almighty.

308
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,520
It's not my own power, it's not your power, it's His power through us, and I'm thankful

309
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,320
that He empowers us.

310
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
What about this?

311
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
He keeps us.

312
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,960
Aren't you thankful for that?

313
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,320
You know how miserable it would be if you had to keep your own salvation?

314
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Seriously, it'd be miserable.

315
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,560
You know why I believe it would be so miserable?

316
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
This is my opinion.

317
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,760
Because you become the authority or the standard.

318
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,000
And it would mess with my mind terribly.

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,040
If I had to wonder, well, wonder what I did today that, man, that was really bad, and

320
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,200
I don't know what I have to do to make up, it'd just be a mess.

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,120
But He promised to keep us.

322
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,080
Notice this in John chapter number 10.

323
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,360
In John chapter number 10, it's a great passage of Scripture, and we think about the blessedness

324
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,720
of being kept by the power of God, as He says in 1 Peter 1 and verse number 5, and I'm so

325
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,600
thankful that He keeps us.

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,520
Here in John 10 and verse number 27, notice what Jesus says,

327
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,280
My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.

328
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,560
And I give unto them eternal life.

329
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Eternal life.

330
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,680
He didn't say I give unto them temporary life.

331
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,120
He didn't say I give unto them probationary life.

332
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,040
He said I give unto them eternal life.

333
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,080
And they shall never perish.

334
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
Neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.

335
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,760
My Father which gave them Me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out

336
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
of My Father's hand.

337
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,120
I and My Father are one.

338
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm thankful that He's given us this promise here.

339
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,280
We understand that, as we mentioned in Romans 6, that the gift of God is eternal life through

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Jesus Christ our Lord.

341
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,440
Here He says My sheep, they hear My voice, and I know them, they follow Me.

342
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,480
And here's what I give them.

343
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
I give them eternal life.

344
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,380
They shall never perish.

345
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,180
I'm so thankful, 1 Peter 1 and verse number 5, jot it down in your notes.

346
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,700
It tells us that we are kept by the power of God.

347
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,020
Listen, I couldn't earn my salvation and neither could you, and I can't keep my salvation and

348
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
neither can you.

349
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,820
Amen?

350
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,460
I'm kept by the power of God.

351
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,540
These promises, we think about the promise that He said that He would save us, He empowers

352
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,820
us, He keeps us.

353
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,100
He tells us this, that sin no longer has dominion over us.

354
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,620
That caused me to rejoice greatly.

355
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,900
Turn to Romans 6, if you will, and you think about this truth of being saved, being a child

356
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
of God.

357
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
Understand that the Spirit of God now lives within you.

358
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,240
He empowers you, that He's keeping you.

359
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,380
We find that He tells us, listen, sin no longer has dominion over you.

360
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,860
You understand that prior to salvation, you were controlled by sin, you were entangled

361
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,660
by sin, you were bound by sin.

362
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,820
But after salvation, the Bible says that sin no longer has dominion over us.

363
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:54,380
It says this in Romans 6 and verse number 14, for sin shall not have dominion over you,

364
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,100
for you're not under the law, but under grace.

365
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
God, you're so thankful that

366
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,460
sin no longer has dominion over you.

367
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,620
You know what happens sometimes?

368
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,020
We get mad about things that happen in the world.

369
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,740
I was talking to someone not long ago

370
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,980
and they were kind of sharing some things with me

371
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,940
and mentioned all sorts of things

372
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,580
and I just kind of paused and said,

373
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,040
listen, let me ask you a question.

374
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,420
Why is it that they behave the way that they behave?

375
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,460
Why is it that they do the things that they do?

376
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,260
Why is it that they act the way that they act?

377
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,040
And the individual that I was speaking with,

378
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,500
they kind of paused and they said,

379
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,060
well, and they began to offer some suggestions

380
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,280
and some answers to the question.

381
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
I said, the bottom line,

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,200
the reason that they behave the way that they behave,

383
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,540
they act the way that they act,

384
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,120
they do the things that they do,

385
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
is because they're lost.

386
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,820
They're sinners.

387
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,740
And we were once in that same position.

388
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,960
Listen, they sin because they're sinners.

389
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,820
They're bound by sin.

390
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,480
They're blinded by the God of this world.

391
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,840
We understand what we've been saved out of,

392
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,540
but sometimes we don't understand

393
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,420
that there are people that we come in contact with

394
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,540
that are still in that darkness,

395
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,540
that are still bound by that sin.

396
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,300
This evening, I am so thankful

397
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,300
for sin shall not have dominion over you.

398
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,940
Listen, you can be victorious.

399
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,620
Actually, we're going to get to that in just a moment.

400
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,140
We don't have to have that mentality

401
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,980
of just, well, it's just what I am.

402
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,860
It's just how I...

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,700
No, no, no.

404
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,800
Sin no longer has dominion over us.

405
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,420
And I'm so thankful for that.

406
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
Victory through Christ.

407
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,200
Number seven, if you're taking notes,

408
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,120
victory through Christ.

409
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,160
We mentioned this morning,

410
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
we spoke about the person, who He is,

411
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,560
and we spoke about the fact that He is victorious.

412
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,520
I'm thankful that His victory enables me to have victory.

413
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,620
We're here in Romans 6.

414
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,400
Look over in Romans 7, if you will,

415
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
and look at verses 24 and 25.

416
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Paul cries out almost in despair, if you will,

417
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,920
in verse number 24, and he says this,

418
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,780
"'Oh, wretched man that I am!

419
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,480
"'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'

420
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,440
What does he say?

421
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,840
"'I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.'

422
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,920
"'So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God,

423
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
"'but with the flesh the law of sin.'"

424
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,120
And he says, I'm thankful to God.

425
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,640
Listen, it's God that will give me the victory.

426
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,120
It is God that will enable me

427
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,800
to live the victorious Christian life.

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,000
In Romans 8, in verse number 37,

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,360
again, maybe a page over in your Bible,

430
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
it says this,

431
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,040
"'Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.

432
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,880
"'Through Him that loved us.'"

433
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,280
What a joy to have victory through Christ.

434
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,400
To know that we can have the victory.

435
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,240
To know that we can live a life not of defeat,

436
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
but a life of victory.

437
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,240
A life of victory.

438
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
Victory through Christ.

439
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,920
We sing the song, Victory in Jesus.

440
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,480
That's a great song, isn't it?

441
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,080
And you think about so many songs

442
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,320
that we can reference as we look at our hymnal,

443
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,000
and I'm thankful I've made mention

444
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
of several of them today throughout the messages,

445
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,760
and what a blessing it is

446
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,440
to have the great hymns of the faith

447
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,080
that reinforce biblical teaching and Bible doctrine,

448
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
and we understand this evening

449
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,000
that we have victory through Jesus.

450
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,960
And I'm thankful for that tonight.

451
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,040
I want to cause you to think about His work in us.

452
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,600
Number eight, if you're taking notes,

453
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm thankful for this promise.

454
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
He promised that He would work in us.

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm thankful that He's working in me.

456
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm thankful that He's working in you.

457
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,480
I mentioned this morning that little song,

458
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,680
that little chorus that we sing with the kids,

459
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,160
that He's still working on me

460
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,720
to make me what I ought to be.

461
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
And I'm thankful for His work in me,

462
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,920
and I'm thankful that He's promised to do so.

463
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Notice in Ephesians 2, a verse of Scripture

464
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,680
that we often are familiar with

465
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,240
as we think about verses eight and nine,

466
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,040
for by grace are you saved through faith,

467
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,920
and that not of yourselves is the gift of God,

468
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,240
not of works, lest any man should boast.

469
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,800
We find that the thought really doesn't end

470
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,240
in verse number nine, it carries into verse number 10,

471
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,600
and we think about the truth that He promised to save us.

472
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,160
Listen, if He was done with us at the moment of salvation,

473
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,480
He'd just go ahead and take us to heaven, amen?

474
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,880
And listen, on some days, maybe we'd wonder

475
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
if it might not be better

476
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,880
if we just went ahead and went to heaven, you know?

477
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,880
But the reality is that He's doing a work in us.

478
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,640
And the purpose of that work in us,

479
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
according to Romans 8, is that we would be conformed

480
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,960
to the image of His dear Son.

481
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,360
It's the process of sanctification.

482
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,080
And here we find in Ephesians 2, in verse number 10,

483
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,080
He says, we are His workmanship,

484
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,960
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

485
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,200
which God hath before ordained

486
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,760
that we should walk in them, in those good works.

487
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
Think about that, we are His workmanship.

488
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,320
In the Old Testament, the Bible uses the picture,

489
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,040
the analogy of Him being the potter and we being the clay.

490
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
Isn't that great imagery?

491
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,480
How many of you ever made anything on a potter's wheel?

492
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,840
Anyone, a few of you?

493
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,920
I had the privilege of the only art class

494
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,480
I ever took in high school that I enjoyed, amen?

495
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
You put some paint in front of me,

496
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,000
you put a pencil or some kind of coloring instrument

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
in front of me, it's a mess, man.

498
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
I am not artistic at all.

499
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,400
And they said, well, you know, Chris,

500
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,480
you have to take some art class.

501
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,360
Are you kidding me?

502
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,000
I need art to graduate?

503
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,360
Yep, yep, you need to take an art class.

504
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,080
And I was able to take pottery.

505
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,800
I had no idea how that was gonna work,

506
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,720
but I actually loved pottery.

507
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,920
It was an enjoyable class.

508
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,680
And you know what's really neat about pottery?

509
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,520
You take that lump of clay

510
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,560
and you throw that thing on that potter's wheel.

511
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,880
Now, today they have those automatic ones.

512
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,080
I lived in Nevada, we were poor, man.

513
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,840
I think the education, Department of Education Nevada,

514
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,680
they just don't have money for anything.

515
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,760
And we didn't have any of those electric wheels

516
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,960
that you just kind of flip the switch and it just spins.

517
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
You had to kick that bad boy.

518
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,640
And you had to spin that thing and kick your leg.

519
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,880
But as you did it, you had this lump of clay

520
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,800
and then you could form it.

521
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,760
You put your hands on there and you begin to form it

522
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,560
and begin to take shape and you do various things.

523
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,280
And I think about the imagery in the scriptures.

524
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,240
At that particular time in my life, I wasn't saved.

525
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,440
I didn't know about that imagery.

526
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,680
But I think about the truth of God's Word

527
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,000
that He is the potter and I am the clay.

528
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,080
Listen, He's doing something in my life.

529
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,400
He's working in my life.

530
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,880
He's working in your life.

531
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,560
And listen, sometimes we don't like the surgical procedures

532
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,880
that He uses in our life as He's working on us

533
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,760
and He's removing some things and He's doing some things.

534
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,720
We say, this doesn't feel good,

535
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,200
but God's working in our lives.

536
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,840
And He's developing us and He's causing us to grow.

537
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
It's exciting.

538
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
He's working.

539
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,840
Notice in Philippians 1, in verse number six,

540
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,560
the Bible says this.

541
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,880
I believe, Brother Tony,

542
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,760
you often mention this verse of scripture.

543
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,000
I think you hold it dear in your heart.

544
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,960
I've heard him use it very often over the years.

545
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,160
But notice what the Bible says here

546
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,600
in this verse of scripture, being confident.

547
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,120
I like having confidence, don't you?

548
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,440
Being confident of this very thing,

549
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,440
that He which hath begun a good work in you.

550
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,640
Who is that?

551
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,280
That's God.

552
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,480
We're His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

553
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,520
We're confident of this very thing,

554
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,880
that He which hath begun a good work in you

555
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,840
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

556
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
I'm so thankful that He's doing the work.

557
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,400
Listen, He knows how to do the work

558
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,760
that He's seeking to accomplish in our lives.

559
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,600
He knows what He's doing.

560
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,240
He's the master potter.

561
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
He makes no mistakes.

562
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,080
And His way is perfect.

563
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,920
And this evening, we ought to rejoice

564
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,840
in the fact that He's working in us,

565
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,520
that He's developing us.

566
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
I've said many times over the years

567
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,840
that our God is always able to deliver us

568
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,960
from any situation, from any circumstance,

569
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
from any hardship, He's able to deliver us.

570
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,040
There are times, however, that He chooses

571
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
not to deliver us from the situation,

572
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,320
but He chooses to deliver us through the situation

573
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,360
so that at the same time, He can develop us.

574
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I understand there are times I'd say,

575
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
God, I'd be perfectly okay if you'd deliver me

576
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,120
from this instead of through this.

577
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,000
I understand, I can relate.

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
But then when you get delivered through the storm,

579
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,200
through the difficulty, and you see

580
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,560
how God is developing you, how He's developing us,

581
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,080
how He's working in us, how we learn more

582
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,480
of who He is and what He's able to do, what a joy.

583
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,960
Say, thank you, Lord.

584
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,920
Thank you, Lord, for your work in my life.

585
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,840
Let me say this, number nine, He provides for us.

586
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,520
I'm so thankful for His provision.

587
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,600
This evening, I'm not simply speaking

588
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,960
of any sort of monetary provision,

589
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,160
though we could understand that to be the case.

590
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,240
But I want you to notice back in Ephesians 1, if you will,

591
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,440
and I want you to see what the Word of God says here

592
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,360
with regard to the provision in which my mind

593
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
is thinking of this evening.

594
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,160
We'll mention briefly Philippians 4

595
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,560
as He speaks about that monetary blessing.

596
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,600
But notice here in Ephesians 1,

597
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,040
the Bible says this in verse number three.

598
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,080
Ephesians 1 and verse number three.

599
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,980
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

600
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,840
notice this,

601
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,100
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings

602
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,340
in heavenly places in Christ.

603
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,140
And you think about the provision,

604
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
the spiritual provision.

605
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,180
You think about this.

606
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,640
You couple that verse with 2 Peter 1

607
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,780
and verse number 3,

608
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,240
and we read that just a few moments ago

609
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
by way of introduction,

610
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,860
but in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 3,

611
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,980
the Bible says this,

612
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,180
according as His divine power,

613
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,400
notice what it says,

614
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,100
hath given unto us all things

615
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,420
that pertain unto life and godliness

616
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,760
through the knowledge of Him

617
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,700
that hath called us to glory and virtue.

618
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,940
I'm thankful for the provision of God,

619
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,420
the spiritual provision.

620
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,420
I'm thankful that God has provided us

621
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,180
with the Word of God.

622
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,940
I'm thankful that God has given us

623
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,180
the Spirit of God

624
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,740
who is our divine teacher.

625
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,820
I'm thankful that God in His wisdom

626
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,180
has blessed us with spiritual teachers

627
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,220
and instructors,

628
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,940
and He's equipped the church

629
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,500
with pastors and teachers.

630
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,380
Why? Because that's the way

631
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,820
that God is providing for us spiritually.

632
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,420
What a joy!

633
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,100
What a blessing!

634
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,300
In Philippians 4,

635
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,820
we notice here in this portion of Scripture

636
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,900
that Paul is communicating with these believers,

637
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,460
and he's rejoicing in the goodness of God

638
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
and the provision of God

639
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,940
and how God used this church at Philippi

640
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,260
to help in His time of need.

641
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,660
He says this in v. 15,

642
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Now ye Philippians know also

643
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,300
that in the beginning of the Gospel

644
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,060
when I departed from Macedonia,

645
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,660
no church communed it with me

646
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,540
as concerning giving and receiving,

647
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,420
but ye only.

648
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,180
He's commending them for that.

649
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,060
He says, for even in Thessalonica,

650
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,860
ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

651
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,940
They were mindful of the opportunity

652
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,340
that God had given them

653
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,380
to be a blessing to the man of God.

654
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,100
And it says this in v. 17,

655
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,860
Not because I desire a gift,

656
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,700
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account,

657
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
but I have all that abound.

658
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,860
I am full, having received of Epaphroditus

659
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,660
the things which were sent from you,

660
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,020
an odor of a sweet smell,

661
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,220
a sacrifice acceptable,

662
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,860
well-pleasing to God.

663
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,740
That's how he describes the sacrifice,

664
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,340
the giving of the believers in Philippi.

665
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,260
And what a great truth.

666
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,500
But then notice what he says in v. 19,

667
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,020
But my God shall supply all your need

668
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,660
according to His riches in glory

669
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,700
by Christ Jesus.

670
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,500
We often refer to the fact

671
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,940
that He owns the cattle on a thousand hills.

672
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,540
He owns the hills as well.

673
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,500
He owns everything.

674
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,860
He has no need.

675
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,380
He has no situation that He can't take care of.

676
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,420
And He will supply.

677
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
If you're reading our daily devotional,

678
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
you read about that individual

679
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,300
that gave that gold piece.

680
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,660
And he gave that gold piece.

681
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,420
And man, he got back, I think it was 12,

682
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
and then there were two more,

683
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,780
so he got 14 for one.

684
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,500
And he gave it to that widow.

685
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,180
And the widow said, I'm gonna pray for you.

686
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,940
I'm gonna pray God's blessing.

687
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,740
And he got 14 pieces of gold.

688
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
He had given one.

689
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,780
He thought, this is wonderful.

690
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,420
And then he found out just a short time later

691
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,660
that there was an estate that was left,

692
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,100
and they left, I think it was 512

693
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,980
or something like that pieces of gold.

694
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,940
Huh.

695
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,460
You can't outgive God.

696
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,020
And we can rejoice in God's provision monetarily,

697
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,260
and we ought to rejoice in His provision

698
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,020
and the way that He takes care of us

699
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,980
and how good He's been to us.

700
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,780
But I want you to think this evening

701
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
of how He's provided for us spiritually

702
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,540
as we mentioned in Ephesians 1

703
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,020
and in 2 Peter 1.

704
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,340
He has given us all things

705
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,260
that pertain unto life and godliness.

706
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,300
And I'm so thankful for that.

707
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,380
And I hope that you'd be thankful for that promise.

708
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,260
He's promised that He has given us those things.

709
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,620
Let me say this.

710
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,380
As we think about our Christian life,

711
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,780
He has promised that our labor is not in vain.

712
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,540
Our labor is not in vain, number 10.

713
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,540
You know, there are times in which we can serve

714
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,060
and we can get overwhelmed

715
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,580
and we can look at the things

716
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,140
that we're seeking to accomplish

717
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,220
and we can feel as if, is it even working?

718
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Is there even any purpose?

719
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,180
Is there any progress that's being made?

720
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,460
But 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 58

721
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,860
reminds us that God has promised to us

722
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,420
that our labor, our work is not in vain in the Lord.

723
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,700
He says this,

724
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,420
therefore, my beloved brethren,

725
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,220
be steadfast, unmovable,

726
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,980
always abounding in the work of the Lord.

727
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,940
Why?

728
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,340
For as much as you know

729
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,340
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

730
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,540
There are times in which we may think

731
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,780
that our labor, it's not working.

732
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,820
I've prayed for, I've sought to give the truth

733
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,620
and it just seems like it's falling on deaf ears.

734
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,580
It feels like there's no progress that's being made.

735
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,700
Listen, God tells us our labor's not in vain in the Lord.

736
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,980
God blesses and God rewards.

737
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,500
And our duty is not the fruit.

738
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,780
Our duty is to do the work that He's called us to do.

739
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,620
Remember, He told us in this church

740
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,820
and earlier in this particular letter,

741
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,700
He said, listen, some plant, some water,

742
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,180
but God gives the increase.

743
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,220
There are times in which we can go

744
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,340
and we can distribute literature

745
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,700
and we can talk to people and we can give truth

746
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,420
and we can say, is it even working?

747
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,900
They say, listen, our labor's not in vain in the Lord.

748
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,020
God is working.

749
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,900
God is at work.

750
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,380
Sometimes we don't always see how God is working.

751
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,820
But we can rejoice in knowing that God is at work.

752
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,580
And He said that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

753
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,380
Number 11, I want you to consider this.

754
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,900
He tells us this promise

755
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,060
that the second death has no power over us.

756
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,420
The second death has no power over us.

757
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,340
If you're saved this evening,

758
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,460
look at Revelation chapter number 20

759
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,980
and rejoice in this wonderful truth

760
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,340
that the second death has no power over you.

761
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,820
The reality is that we've said many times over the years

762
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,500
to be born once is to die twice,

763
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,300
but to be born twice is to die but once.

764
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
We understand that there's a physical birth

765
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,940
and there's a physical death.

766
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,580
There is a spiritual birth and there is a spiritual death.

767
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,100
The Bible speaks of all of those things.

768
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,780
And if you're born just once,

769
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,540
you only have a physical birth,

770
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,620
then you'll die twice.

771
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,620
You'll die a physical death and you'll die a spiritual death.

772
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,100
However, we can rejoice greatly this evening

773
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,780
that because He promised to save us

774
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,900
and all that we mentioned that He does

775
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,740
as we walk with Him and the work that He does through us,

776
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,660
that we know that He said

777
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
the second death has no power over us

778
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,140
because I've been born physically

779
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,420
and I've been born spiritually.

780
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,820
And I'm only gonna ever die a physical death.

781
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,260
Notice in Revelation 20, in verse number six,

782
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,100
the Bible says,

783
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,900
blessed and holy is he that hath part

784
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,620
in the first resurrection.

785
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,620
On such, the second death hath no power.

786
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Aren't you thankful for that?

787
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,900
The Bible tells us at the end of this chapter

788
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,420
in Revelation 20, verses 11 through 15,

789
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,260
it gives us the picture,

790
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,660
the event of that great white throne judgment

791
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,700
where death and hell are cast into like a fire.

792
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,940
This is the second death,

793
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,500
according to verse number 14 of Revelation 20.

794
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,260
But those of us that have been born again,

795
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,660
those of us that have placed our faith and trust

796
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,780
in Jesus Christ,

797
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,700
remember what Jesus said to Nicodemus

798
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,100
in John chapter number three,

799
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,620
He comes to Jesus by night.

800
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,100
He says, I know, we know that you're a teacher sent from God

801
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,740
and Jesus said, except you be born again,

802
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,420
you cannot see the kingdom of God.

803
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,460
Marvel not that I said unto thee,

804
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,940
you must be born again.

805
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,100
How is it that I could be born again, right?

806
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,619
Nicodemus is an understanding.

807
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:45,179
And we understand that the second birth,

808
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:48,619
being born again is salvation.

809
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:52,260
It's that moment that we trust Christ as our savior.

810
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,540
I have a birthday and it's my physical birthday

811
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,940
and I'm mindful of that date, July 15th,

812
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,580
the day in which I entered into this world physically.

813
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,179
But of really greater significance in my mind

814
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,900
is the date August 31st,

815
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,820
because that's when I was born again.

816
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,179
It was 17 years later,

817
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,940
but I'm thankful for that date when I was born again.

818
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:23,299
And we understand this evening all of those things

819
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:26,380
that He has promised to do in and through us

820
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,540
and the promises that we've rehearsed,

821
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,220
but then as we get to the end of our walk with God,

822
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,059
we understand that He says

823
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:37,140
that the second death has no power over us.

824
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,260
Let me tell you this,

825
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,260
and you're well familiar with this promise.

826
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,540
Number 12, if you're taking notes,

827
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,380
He promised to return for us.

828
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,980
He promised to return for us.

829
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,260
We're familiar with this promise.

830
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,700
In John 14, in verses one through three,

831
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,540
Jesus says,

832
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,059
let not your heart be troubled.

833
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:59,380
You believe in God, believe also in me.

834
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,420
In my Father's house.

835
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,580
house or many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a

836
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,960
place for you and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you

837
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:18,060
unto myself that where I am there you may be also." What great promise. We

838
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,140
mentioned this morning in 2nd Peter 3 in verse 9 dealing with the long

839
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,740
suffering of God and it says that our God He is not slack concerning His

840
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,800
promises. Some men count slackness but His long-suffering to us were not

841
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,860
willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. Listen, He

842
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:41,660
has promised that He's going to return and we can rejoice that He indeed is

843
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,020
going to return. We don't know the day nor the hour, no man does, but I want you

844
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,440
to be mindful of what the Bible says in 1st Thessalonians 4. The picture, the

845
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,500
truth, the teaching here of the rapture and we can rejoice in this promise of

846
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,200
His return and we can look at verses 13 through 18 but for sake of time this

847
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,600
evening let me just draw your attention to verse number 17 of 1st Thessalonians

848
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:14,720
chapter number 4. His return for us, He's promised that He's going to return for

849
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,200
us. It says this in 1st Thessalonians 4 and 17,

850
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,600
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the

851
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,420
clouds to meet the Lord in the air and then notice this last phrase and so

852
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:35,940
shall we ever be with the Lord. He's promised He's coming back for us. I don't

853
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,380
know when but I'm looking forward to it aren't you? And we find that He's

854
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,580
promised to return. Number 13, He's promised that we'll have a glorified

855
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,220
body. I mentioned this morning about riding a horse I said I'm glad I'm not

856
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,500
gonna do that in this body but the reality is that we have a glorified body

857
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,160
that one day we will have. The Bible tells us in 1st Corinthians chapter

858
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,200
number 15 that this mortal shall put on immortality, that this corruption shall

859
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,800
put on incorruption and I'm so thankful that 1st John tells us that when we see

860
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,380
Him we shall be like Him and what a wonderful truth that we have in the Word

861
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,200
of God that we're going to receive a glorified body. That He talks to us in

862
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,960
Revelation about sickness and pain and all of those things being no more and we

863
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,920
understand that we don't have that glorified body yet but He's promised

864
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,480
that He's going to give us one and I'm so thankful for that wonderful promise.

865
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,160
Let me close with these two thoughts this evening. Number 14, if you're taking

866
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,400
notes, He's promised that we will reign with Him, that we'll reign with Him. I

867
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,000
purposefully did not read all of Revelation 20 in verse number 6 but if

868
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,080
you draw your attention back to that verse of Scripture when it speaks about

869
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:02,560
the fact that the second death hath no power over us and how we can rejoice in

870
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,720
that truth, verse 6 concludes by saying this, but they, those that are blessed and

871
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,720
holy because they're part of the first resurrection, those of us that have

872
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
trust that Jesus Christ is our personal Savior, they shall be priests of God and

873
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:27,200
of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years. That's wonderful. I mean,

874
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,920
I don't know all that we're gonna do but it doesn't really matter. We're gonna

875
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:40,360
reign with Him. He's promised us this. Listen, our future is bright. Amen? I mean,

876
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,800
think about all that we mentioned from salvation. He saved us but then all that

877
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,640
He's doing in and through us and how He's working and He's empowered us and

878
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,160
sin has no dominion over us and all those things that we've mentioned and

879
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,360
then to understand that He's coming back for us. He's gonna give us this glorified

880
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:04,600
body. We're gonna reign with Him. What a joy. And finally this evening, eternity

881
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,480
with my Savior. He's promised me. He's promised you if you've trusted Him as

882
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,080
your Savior that you'll spend eternity with Him. We read the last part of 1

883
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,200
Thessalonians 4 and verse number 17 when the Bible says, there and so shall we

884
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,920
ever be with the Lord. You know, many times people ask the question, what is

885
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:34,080
heaven like? There are individuals that have sought to write books and sell

886
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,440
books about being in heaven and Paul couldn't talk about it and so I don't

887
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:47,000
think anyone else could talk about it. Amen? The reality is that God tells us

888
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,600
some things about heaven but you know what makes heaven heaven? We're gonna be

889
00:44:52,600 --> 00:45:02,920
with Him. If you remove Him, it's not heaven. It's not heaven. But the reality

890
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,040
that for all of eternity and it's hard for our minds to really grasp eternity

891
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:16,080
because we're stuck in time. I love the the last verse. I think it's the last

892
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,600
verse in our hymnal. I know Amazing Grace. It depends what hymnal you look in.

893
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,400
There's a ton of verses to it but it speaks about the fact that when we've

894
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,040
been there for 10,000 years, right? We still don't have any less time than when

895
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,880
we first began because it's forever and ever and ever that we're gonna be with

896
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,560
Him. Paul said in 1st 2nd Corinthians 5 verse number 8 that he was confident of

897
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,720
this to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. But I want to

898
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,040
draw your attention to Revelation 21 just as we close this evening and

899
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,680
looking at a few verses of Scripture. Revelation 21 beginning in verse number

900
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,600
1. The Bible says, and I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and

901
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,960
the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the

902
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,600
holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride

903
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,160
adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold

904
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:25,440
the tabernacle of God is with men and He will dwell with them and they shall be

905
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:32,840
His people and God Himself shall be with them and be their God. God shall wipe

906
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,480
away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,

907
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,080
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are

908
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,160
passed away. And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things

909
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,200
new. And He said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And He said

910
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,920
unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto

911
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,520
Him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that

912
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,440
overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be His God and He shall be my Son.

913
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,320
And you notice several times there in verse number 3 specifically speaking

914
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,680
about the fact that He will dwell with them. They shall be His people and God

915
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:25,360
Himself shall be with them and be their God. Our future is bright. I understand

916
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,800
at times in this life that we can get bogged down and we can see all of these

917
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,380
things that are around us and we can see these these circumstances and all of

918
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,000
these these things are just temporary. They're just temporary and I don't use

919
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,640
that phraseology to to try to minimize them but I simply say let's maximize

920
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,320
eternity. Let's turn our attention as 2nd Corinthians 4 says to those things

921
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,560
which are eternal not to the things that are temporal and let us be mindful.

922
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,240
Listen, He's given us a book. He's preserved it. He's told us that it's

923
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,440
powerful and contained within this precious Bible are exceeding great and

924
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:11,040
precious promises. I've just given you a few this evening but I hope with the few

925
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,960
that I've given you that your hearts been encouraged. That from the moment of

926
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,080
salvation into the moment in which we'll reign with Him and be with Him

927
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,800
forever all of those things that He's promised that He's doing in and through

928
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,400
us. It's a blessing and when I focus my attention upon my future, when I focus my

929
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,280
attention upon my God, when I am taking to heart the truth looking unto Jesus

930
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:46,640
the author and finisher of our faith, how my heart can rejoice in the midst of

931
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,840
turmoil, chaos, confusion, all kinds of craziness. I can have a heart that

932
00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:01,160
rejoices. Why? Because I got some promises that are precious. He is precious.

933
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:09,040
Remember, why is it that we rejoice? For His person, because of who He is. Why is

934
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,760
it that I rejoice? Because of His presence, because He's promised to be

935
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,840
with me. That wasn't part of my list because we dealt with it this morning,

936
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,440
but what a great promise. And then all of these promises, I hope this evening, I

937
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:31,760
hope this week, I hope all of our days, not just at Thanksgiving time, but as the

938
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,640
people of God were to be a thankful people, always in everything give thanks.

939
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,720
This is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Amen? And we're to rejoice

940
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:53,280
evermore. This is the day which the Lord hath made. I will rejoice and be glad in

941
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:02,280
it. We have much to be thankful for. The list could go on.

942
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,480
and on and on. As I concluded this morning, I haven't really dealt with all

943
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,720
the things that He's done for me and given me and all of these

944
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:19,600
wonderful things that He has, who He is, but then what He's done. And I hope this

945
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:28,040
evening that we're mindful and we're rejoicing because our God, He is precious.

946
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:35,480
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I pray that, Lord, our hearts

947
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:47,320
have been encouraged today as we've considered Your person, Your presence, and

948
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,960
Your promises. Oh God, I pray that our hearts have been encouraged, strengthened.

949
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:07,480
I pray that we would be a rejoicing people, understanding that these truths

950
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:16,920
that we've examined today are not impacted by the shifting sands of this

951
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:25,040
world. You remain unchanged. You're immutable. Your promises, they are sure.

952
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:35,920
Your presence is absolutely certain. God, would You help us to rejoice greatly?

953
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,720
There's one present here that's not sure of heaven, one that's tuned in via

954
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,400
livestream that's not sure of heaven. God, it is our prayer that today would be the

955
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:56,280
day of their salvation. The Word of God says, behold, today is the day of salvation.

956
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:04,360
What a joy it would be to hear the news of a sinner being saved. And if there's one

957
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:10,240
that's never been saved, they don't know these promises that we've spoken of this

958
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:18,080
evening. God, would You help them to understand their need for Christ? Work as only You can

959
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,680
work and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me?
