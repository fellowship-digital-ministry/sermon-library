WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
In verse number seven, we started here this morning,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.159
we're gonna start here again this evening.

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.539
And I am so thankful for the Word of God,

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:10.720
thankful for the truth contained therein.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.560
And as I said this morning,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.680
we're reminded of just how precious our God is.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.319
And I am so thankful that we have this book

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.879
that reveals these wonderful truths to us.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.159
In verse number seven,

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.840
I read the first seven verses this morning.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.600
I'm just gonna jump right into verse number seven.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.959
This evening, to remind you of the text,

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:35.880
it says this, unto you therefore,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.119
which believe he is precious.

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.119
And we said this morning that that word precious,

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.979
it means of the honor which one has by reason of rank

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.759
and state of office which he holds.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.159
As we considered the thought this morning,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.919
we said that we're thankful for his person, for who he is,

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:57.419
thankful for his presence,

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:00.139
the fact that he said I will never leave thee

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.659
nor forsake thee.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.459
This evening, as we continue our thought

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.980
with he is precious,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.459
I wanna look at some promises

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.180
that he's given us in his Word.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.779
And it's interesting if you turn over to 2 Peter,

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:15.779
just a few pages over and look in the first chapter,

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:17.940
you begin to see the introduction here

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.860
and notice what is said in verse number three.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.459
According as his divine power hath given unto us

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.699
all things that pertain unto life and godliness,

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.500
through the knowledge of him that hath called us

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.059
to glory and virtue,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.660
notice verse number four,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.819
whereby are given unto us

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.819
exceeding great and precious promises.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.580
That by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000
having escaped the corruption that is in the world

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.839
through lust.

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:53.860
In 2 Corinthians 1 and verse number 20,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180
we are told that all the promises of God in him are yea

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.019
and in him, amen,

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.379
under the glory of God by us,

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.940
all the promises of God in him are yea.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.360
And I'm so thankful that God has given us promises

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.580
in his Word.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.000
And someone said this,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.779
it's a statement from yesteryear

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.779
and it says, as the individual was speaking of promises,

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.179
it says this, the individual noted,

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:26.000
a promise is only as good as the person who makes it.

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.419
We understand that to be the case, correct?

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.539
And a promise is only as good as the person who makes it.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.339
The character of the promiser

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.500
is what gives the promise its value.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.940
Now think about that.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.339
The character of the promiser,

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.619
the one who's making the promises,

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.699
the character of that individual

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.020
is what gives the promise its value.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.179
Now we mentioned here that Peter says

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.100
in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.300
whereby are given unto us exceeding great

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.740
and precious promises.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.820
The thought continues and says,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.619
the promises of God are meant to ignite faith,

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.580
expectation and desire,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.619
and then to point us to him.

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.220
And you think about the way that the promises of God

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.259
should ignite faith in us and expectation

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.979
and should cause us to draw closer to him.

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.979
His promises act to bind our hearts to his.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.860
The song says, every promise of the book is mine.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.660
And what a blessing to think about the many promises

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.619
that are contained within the Word of God.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.979
Numbers 23 and verse number 19 tells us

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.619
that God is not a man that he should lie.

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.059
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.899
He's trustworthy.

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:52.899
He's dependable.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.460
He is truth.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.660
And he's given us many, many promises.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.220
And these promises are indeed exceeding great and precious.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.300
This evening I have a list of 15 promises

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.660
that I want to give you.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.220
And the list is not exhaustive.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.820
You can go and you can find many, many promises

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.619
within the Word of God.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.779
I'm going to start with two promises

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.820
with regard to the Word of God.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.700
And then if you follow, hopefully, the logic,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.019
it makes as much sense to you as it does to me,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.100
I'm going to kind of begin at salvation

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.299
where we begin in promises that pertain

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:29.019
to our walk with God and eventually through eternity.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.260
Consider this promise, the promise that God has given us

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.739
to preserve his Word.

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:35.660
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.459
in Psalm chapter number 12.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.779
And I want you to notice a few verses of scripture here

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.540
with regard to the promise of preservation.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.299
And the first two that I mentioned that we'll look at

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:46.779
are dealing with the Word of God.

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.260
The reason is because it's this book

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.779
that contains the promises.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.820
And therefore, I thought it best that we would look

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.899
at some promises that God has given us

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:57.700
with regard to his Word,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.500
so that we could use that as really foundation

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.739
for these other promises that we'll look to.

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.660
In Psalm 12, in verse number six, the Bible says,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.619
"'The words of the Lord are pure words.

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.260
As silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.019
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:23.019
Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever.'"

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.140
And as you recall, this morning,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.339
as we looked at the person of Jesus Christ,

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.019
being thankful for his person, who he is,

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.380
the very first thing that we mentioned

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.459
is he is Alpha and Omega, he's eternal.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.820
And here we find that he's promised

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.220
that he would preserve his words,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.140
these words that are pure words,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.140
he's gonna preserve them from this generation forever.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.459
And to be mindful of the fact this evening

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:52.660
that the eternal God has given us a promise

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.380
to preserve the precious Word of God

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.820
ought to cause us to rejoice

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.579
because I can have full confidence in faith

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:01.980
in what the Word of God says.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.820
Why?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.179
Because God said he was going to preserve it.

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:07.540
And since God said he was gonna preserve it

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.179
because God is trustworthy and dependable

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.660
and always does what he says he will do,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.660
we can rest assured that God has indeed preserved his Word.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.660
Notice, if you will, in Psalm 119 in verse number 89,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.459
the Bible tells us, of course,

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:27.459
you're familiar with this chapter in Psalm 119

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:29.059
dealing with the Word of God

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:32.420
and all the wonderful characteristics

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.619
and the ways in which the psalmist

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.700
is relating to the Word of God and its place in his life.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.339
And here in Psalm 119 in verse 89,

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:42.179
the Bible says,

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:47.179
forever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in heaven.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.380
Forever.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.140
His Word is settled in heaven.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.980
Jesus said this in Matthew 24 in verse number 35

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.500
as he's speaking here and giving instruction,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.940
he gives note with regard to the Word of God

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.179
and he says, heaven and earth shall pass away,

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:07.179
but my words shall not pass away.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.700
There are people that are trying to revise the Bible.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.459
They're trying to remove the Bible, right?

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.619
We live in a society in which they're trying to revise it,

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:22.100
they're trying to remove it,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.579
but we find that God has promised

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:26.459
that he's going to preserve it.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:28.540
And it doesn't matter, as we mentioned this morning,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.779
our God is victorious.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:32.660
It doesn't matter of the scheme and plan

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.019
of the evil one and the wicked one

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:38.739
to try to rid our society of this book.

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:41.459
God said that his Word was settled

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.779
and that his Word would not pass away.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:45.579
He said that he would preserve it

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:47.579
from this generation forever.

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:50.739
And we can rejoice this evening that we have a Bible.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.299
Not only did he promise to preserve his Word,

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:57.540
but I want you to consider that he promised to us

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.420
the power of his Word.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.260
He promised that his Word was powerful and it works.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.059
And now that encourages me because as a preacher,

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:09.540
I've been instructed to preach the Word.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.820
And when we consider the place that the Bible has

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.059
in our lives as individuals,

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:19.260
we find that God has told us, listen, my Word is powerful.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.660
My Word will accomplish what I desire for it to accomplish.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.619
We're mindful of that very truth in Isaiah 55

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:28.619
and verse number 11,

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:31.980
where here the promise is given with regard

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.780
to the Word of God accomplishing its purpose.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.460
Notice in Isaiah 55 and verse number 11,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.820
the Bible says this,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.739
so shall my Word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:49.739
It shall not return unto me void,

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:52.700
but it shall accomplish that which I please

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.700
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

00:08:58.099 --> 00:09:00.820
Aren't you thankful for that promise?

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.659
I mean, what a joy to understand.

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:04.539
Listen, when we give the Word of God,

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:06.260
we may not see the effects,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.900
we may not see the results immediately,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.780
but we can rest assured in what God has told us

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.859
about his Word and the purpose of his Word,

00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:17.460
the power of his Word,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.580
and we can rest that it will accomplish

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.619
what it's intended to accomplish.

00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:24.099
Notice in 1 Thessalonians chapter number two,

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:27.780
as Paul is commending this church in Thessalonica

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.780
and he's speaking to them about the ways

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.940
in which they were growing and prospering

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.780
in their faith and their love,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.700
and we find that he mentions to them specifically

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.619
in 1 Thessalonians two, in verse number 13,

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:45.260
the way in which God's Word had worked in their lives.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.059
And it encourages us for understanding this evening

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:53.179
how God's Word continues to work in our lives.

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:55.539
Notice in verse 13 of 1 Thessalonians two,

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:58.140
the Bible says for this cause also,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.780
thank we God without.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.840
sing, because when you receive the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.720
not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, notice, which effectually

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.560
worketh also in you that believe."

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.080
This evening we could take the time and go around the room and give testimony of how

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:30.720
God's Word has worked in our lives, how God's Word has been at work, the power of God's

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.120
Word accomplishing things in our lives as we study the Word of God, as we read and meditate

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.600
upon the Word of God, as we hear the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.080
It's through the preaching and teaching of the Word of God, the reading of the Word of

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.680
God, the receiving of God's Word that our faith increases.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.600
It's through this book that I know my Savior, Paul says in Philippians 3, that I may know

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.400
Him and the power of His resurrection.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.840
And if you want to know God, you need to know the Bible.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.920
And I'm thankful that God has preserved it for us, and He's promised that it will work,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.560
the power of His Word.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.320
He said that His Word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.240
He said that His Word was profitable.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.280
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, it works, and I'm so

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.720
thankful this evening for that truth.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.480
As we consider the foundation of these promises that we'll look at quickly this evening, I

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.360
want you to understand that each promise that we look to this evening is found in this book,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.100
and thus the foundation of understanding the preservation and the power of God's Word.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.320
He promises this.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.760
He promises to save us.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.800
He promises to save us.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.320
I'm going to begin, as I mentioned, kind of the logic of these promises of really beginning

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.720
at salvation.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.240
What a great song that we sang tonight, when heaven came down and glory filled my soul,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.040
in understanding salvation and the day in which we trust that Christ is our Savior.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.240
Romans 10 and verse number 13 is a verse of Scripture that many of us have committed to

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:15.320
memory, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.820
That's a promise, isn't it?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.960
And what a joy.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.000
I don't know the number of people that I've told over the years that verse of Scripture

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.040
as I've had the unique privilege and opportunity to share the gospel with individuals, and

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.960
as I would speak to them about Christ and about what He did for them and what was accomplished

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.320
on the cross of Calvary, I'd say something like this.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.840
He promises to save you if you just trust Him.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.000
In fact, I believe that some of our literature, some of our door hangers, and some of our

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.960
brochures carry that very verbiage that He promises to save you if you simply ask Him.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:59.360
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.320
I'm thankful for that promise.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:09.200
It was on August 31st, 1997, whatever that is, 24 years ago, a little over 24 years ago,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.480
that I put my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, claiming that promise, claiming

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.360
that God promised that He'd save me if I'd call on Him, understanding that I was a sinner.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.240
I was helpless and hopeless, just as you were, but I understood who He was and what He did,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.240
and I understood that He promised, He said that the gift of God is eternal life through

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.680
Jesus Christ, our Lord, and I placed my faith and trust in Jesus Christ.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.080
The Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter number 7 that wherefore He is able also to save them

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.080
to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080
for them.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.080
Listen, aren't you thankful that God promised to save you?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.320
He didn't just promise to save you.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.080
He uses us to share the gospel with others, and that promise extends to whosoever shall

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.560
call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and what a great promise.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.000
I'm so thankful for that promise.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.520
Not only did He promise to save us, He promised to empower us.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.520
He promised to empower us.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.560
I'm thankful this evening that I don't have to live the Christian life in my own flesh.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.800
By the way, I can't, and neither can you.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.000
You know what's so frustrating is when we try, when we try to live the Christian life

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.240
in our own power, in our own strength, and we try to live it in our own flesh, and it's

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.720
frustrating, but He promised that He would empower us.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.720
We find in Acts 1.8 as He says to the disciples as they're there after they had heard this

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.360
great commission and before they would go, of course, to the ascension and then wait

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.200
for the promise of the Father.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:55.600
We find that Jesus says, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.800
I'm thankful for the empowering of Christ.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.760
I'm thankful that He's promised to empower us, that it's not in my flesh.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:08.320
Remember, Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.600
For to will is present.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.520
But then how do we accomplish that, right?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.360
Oh, woe is me, oh wretched man that I am.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.000
And we find here that He's promised to empower us that we're to be filled with the Spirit

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of God.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.920
Ephesians 5 and verse number 18, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.400
with the Spirit of God.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.520
And we understand that importance of daily being filled with His Spirit.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.480
The Bible says in Galatians 5, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.520
of the flesh.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.240
The reality is that your flesh and my flesh has lust.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:49.240
Our flesh, our old nature, our sinful nature, that old man, it has desires, it has fleshly

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.280
desires, but the promise is that as we walk in the Spirit, we shall not fulfill the lust

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280
of the flesh.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280
Why?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280
Because He empowers us.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.560
I'm so thankful that it's Christ in you, the hope of glory.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.840
The reality is that He told us that we would have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840
God.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.280
Remember what He said to the disciples when He said that He was going to depart.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.120
He said, it's expedient for you that I go away.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
Why?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.200
Because I'm going to send the Holy Spirit, I'm going to send the Comforter.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.520
And we find that this evening at the moment of salvation, we trust Christ as our Savior,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.800
that He empowers us and He dwells within us, and we have the power of God Almighty.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.520
It's not my own power, it's not your power, it's His power through us, and I'm thankful

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.320
that He empowers us.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320
What about this?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320
He keeps us.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.960
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.320
You know how miserable it would be if you had to keep your own salvation?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.360
Seriously, it'd be miserable.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.560
You know why I believe it would be so miserable?

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.160
This is my opinion.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.760
Because you become the authority or the standard.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.000
And it would mess with my mind terribly.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.040
If I had to wonder, well, wonder what I did today that, man, that was really bad, and

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.200
I don't know what I have to do to make up, it'd just be a mess.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.120
But He promised to keep us.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.080
Notice this in John chapter number 10.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.360
In John chapter number 10, it's a great passage of Scripture, and we think about the blessedness

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.720
of being kept by the power of God, as He says in 1 Peter 1 and verse number 5, and I'm so

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.600
thankful that He keeps us.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.520
Here in John 10 and verse number 27, notice what Jesus says,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:42.280
My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.560
And I give unto them eternal life.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560
Eternal life.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.680
He didn't say I give unto them temporary life.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.120
He didn't say I give unto them probationary life.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.040
He said I give unto them eternal life.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:04.080
And they shall never perish.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.880
Neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.760
My Father which gave them Me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.760
of My Father's hand.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.120
I and My Father are one.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.160
I'm thankful that He's given us this promise here.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.280
We understand that, as we mentioned in Romans 6, that the gift of God is eternal life through

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.960
Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.440
Here He says My sheep, they hear My voice, and I know them, they follow Me.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.480
And here's what I give them.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.840
I give them eternal life.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.380
They shall never perish.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.180
I'm so thankful, 1 Peter 1 and verse number 5, jot it down in your notes.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.700
It tells us that we are kept by the power of God.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.020
Listen, I couldn't earn my salvation and neither could you, and I can't keep my salvation and

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.020
neither can you.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.820
Amen?

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.460
I'm kept by the power of God.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.540
These promises, we think about the promise that He said that He would save us, He empowers

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.820
us, He keeps us.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:09.100
He tells us this, that sin no longer has dominion over us.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.620
That caused me to rejoice greatly.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.900
Turn to Romans 6, if you will, and you think about this truth of being saved, being a child

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.900
of God.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300
Understand that the Spirit of God now lives within you.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.240
He empowers you, that He's keeping you.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:29.380
We find that He tells us, listen, sin no longer has dominion over you.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:36.860
You understand that prior to salvation, you were controlled by sin, you were entangled

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.660
by sin, you were bound by sin.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.820
But after salvation, the Bible says that sin no longer has dominion over us.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:54.380
It says this in Romans 6 and verse number 14, for sin shall not have dominion over you,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.100
for you're not under the law, but under grace.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.100
God, you're so thankful that

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.460
sin no longer has dominion over you.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.620
You know what happens sometimes?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.020
We get mad about things that happen in the world.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.740
I was talking to someone not long ago

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.980
and they were kind of sharing some things with me

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.940
and mentioned all sorts of things

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.580
and I just kind of paused and said,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.040
listen, let me ask you a question.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.420
Why is it that they behave the way that they behave?

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.460
Why is it that they do the things that they do?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.260
Why is it that they act the way that they act?

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.040
And the individual that I was speaking with,

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.500
they kind of paused and they said,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.060
well, and they began to offer some suggestions

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.280
and some answers to the question.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.800
I said, the bottom line,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.200
the reason that they behave the way that they behave,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.540
they act the way that they act,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.120
they do the things that they do,

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.040
is because they're lost.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.820
They're sinners.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.740
And we were once in that same position.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.960
Listen, they sin because they're sinners.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.820
They're bound by sin.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.480
They're blinded by the God of this world.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.840
We understand what we've been saved out of,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.540
but sometimes we don't understand

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.420
that there are people that we come in contact with

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.540
that are still in that darkness,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.540
that are still bound by that sin.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.300
This evening, I am so thankful

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.300
for sin shall not have dominion over you.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.940
Listen, you can be victorious.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.620
Actually, we're going to get to that in just a moment.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.140
We don't have to have that mentality

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.980
of just, well, it's just what I am.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.860
It's just how I...

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.700
No, no, no.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.800
Sin no longer has dominion over us.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.420
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.720
Victory through Christ.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.200
Number seven, if you're taking notes,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.120
victory through Christ.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.160
We mentioned this morning,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.920
we spoke about the person, who He is,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.560
and we spoke about the fact that He is victorious.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.520
I'm thankful that His victory enables me to have victory.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.620
We're here in Romans 6.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.400
Look over in Romans 7, if you will,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.640
and look at verses 24 and 25.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.640
Paul cries out almost in despair, if you will,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.920
in verse number 24, and he says this,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.780
"'Oh, wretched man that I am!

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.480
"'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.440
What does he say?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.840
"'I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.'

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.920
"'So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.680
"'but with the flesh the law of sin.'"

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.120
And he says, I'm thankful to God.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.640
Listen, it's God that will give me the victory.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.120
It is God that will enable me

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.800
to live the victorious Christian life.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.000
In Romans 8, in verse number 37,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.360
again, maybe a page over in your Bible,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.200
it says this,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.040
"'Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.880
"'Through Him that loved us.'"

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.280
What a joy to have victory through Christ.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.400
To know that we can have the victory.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.240
To know that we can live a life not of defeat,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.640
but a life of victory.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.240
A life of victory.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.560
Victory through Christ.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.920
We sing the song, Victory in Jesus.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.480
That's a great song, isn't it?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.080
And you think about so many songs

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.320
that we can reference as we look at our hymnal,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.000
and I'm thankful I've made mention

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.400
of several of them today throughout the messages,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.760
and what a blessing it is

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.440
to have the great hymns of the faith

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.080
that reinforce biblical teaching and Bible doctrine,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.840
and we understand this evening

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.000
that we have victory through Jesus.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.960
And I'm thankful for that tonight.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.040
I want to cause you to think about His work in us.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.600
Number eight, if you're taking notes,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.160
I'm thankful for this promise.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.640
He promised that He would work in us.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.280
I'm thankful that He's working in me.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.600
I'm thankful that He's working in you.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.480
I mentioned this morning that little song,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.680
that little chorus that we sing with the kids,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.160
that He's still working on me

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.720
to make me what I ought to be.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.880
And I'm thankful for His work in me,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.920
and I'm thankful that He's promised to do so.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.720
Notice in Ephesians 2, a verse of Scripture

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.680
that we often are familiar with

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.240
as we think about verses eight and nine,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.040
for by grace are you saved through faith,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.920
and that not of yourselves is the gift of God,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.240
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.800
We find that the thought really doesn't end

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.240
in verse number nine, it carries into verse number 10,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.600
and we think about the truth that He promised to save us.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.160
Listen, if He was done with us at the moment of salvation,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.480
He'd just go ahead and take us to heaven, amen?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.880
And listen, on some days, maybe we'd wonder

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.200
if it might not be better

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.880
if we just went ahead and went to heaven, you know?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.880
But the reality is that He's doing a work in us.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.640
And the purpose of that work in us,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.480
according to Romans 8, is that we would be conformed

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.960
to the image of His dear Son.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.360
It's the process of sanctification.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.080
And here we find in Ephesians 2, in verse number 10,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.080
He says, we are His workmanship,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.960
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.200
which God hath before ordained

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.760
that we should walk in them, in those good works.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.920
Think about that, we are His workmanship.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.320
In the Old Testament, the Bible uses the picture,

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.040
the analogy of Him being the potter and we being the clay.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.560
Isn't that great imagery?

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.480
How many of you ever made anything on a potter's wheel?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.840
Anyone, a few of you?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.920
I had the privilege of the only art class

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.480
I ever took in high school that I enjoyed, amen?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.920
You put some paint in front of me,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.000
you put a pencil or some kind of coloring instrument

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.720
in front of me, it's a mess, man.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.280
I am not artistic at all.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.400
And they said, well, you know, Chris,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.480
you have to take some art class.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.360
Are you kidding me?

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.000
I need art to graduate?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.360
Yep, yep, you need to take an art class.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.080
And I was able to take pottery.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.800
I had no idea how that was gonna work,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.720
but I actually loved pottery.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.920
It was an enjoyable class.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.680
And you know what's really neat about pottery?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.520
You take that lump of clay

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.560
and you throw that thing on that potter's wheel.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.880
Now, today they have those automatic ones.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.080
I lived in Nevada, we were poor, man.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.840
I think the education, Department of Education Nevada,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.680
they just don't have money for anything.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.760
And we didn't have any of those electric wheels

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.960
that you just kind of flip the switch and it just spins.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.680
You had to kick that bad boy.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.640
And you had to spin that thing and kick your leg.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.880
But as you did it, you had this lump of clay

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.800
and then you could form it.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.760
You put your hands on there and you begin to form it

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.560
and begin to take shape and you do various things.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.280
And I think about the imagery in the scriptures.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.240
At that particular time in my life, I wasn't saved.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.440
I didn't know about that imagery.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.680
But I think about the truth of God's Word

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.000
that He is the potter and I am the clay.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.080
Listen, He's doing something in my life.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.400
He's working in my life.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.880
He's working in your life.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.560
And listen, sometimes we don't like the surgical procedures

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.880
that He uses in our life as He's working on us

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.760
and He's removing some things and He's doing some things.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.720
We say, this doesn't feel good,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.200
but God's working in our lives.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.840
And He's developing us and He's causing us to grow.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.960
It's exciting.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.160
He's working.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.840
Notice in Philippians 1, in verse number six,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.560
the Bible says this.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.880
I believe, Brother Tony,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.760
you often mention this verse of scripture.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.000
I think you hold it dear in your heart.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.960
I've heard him use it very often over the years.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.160
But notice what the Bible says here

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.600
in this verse of scripture, being confident.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.120
I like having confidence, don't you?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.440
Being confident of this very thing,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.440
that He which hath begun a good work in you.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.640
Who is that?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.280
That's God.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.480
We're His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.520
We're confident of this very thing,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.880
that He which hath begun a good work in you

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.840
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.080
I'm so thankful that He's doing the work.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.400
Listen, He knows how to do the work

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.760
that He's seeking to accomplish in our lives.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.600
He knows what He's doing.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.240
He's the master potter.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.920
He makes no mistakes.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.080
And His way is perfect.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.920
And this evening, we ought to rejoice

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.840
in the fact that He's working in us,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.520
that He's developing us.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.000
I've said many times over the years

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.840
that our God is always able to deliver us

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.960
from any situation, from any circumstance,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840
from any hardship, He's able to deliver us.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.040
There are times, however, that He chooses

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.040
not to deliver us from the situation,

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.320
but He chooses to deliver us through the situation

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.360
so that at the same time, He can develop us.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.400
I understand there are times I'd say,

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.600
God, I'd be perfectly okay if you'd deliver me

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.120
from this instead of through this.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.000
I understand, I can relate.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.840
But then when you get delivered through the storm,

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.200
through the difficulty, and you see

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.560
how God is developing you, how He's developing us,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.080
how He's working in us, how we learn more

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.480
of who He is and what He's able to do, what a joy.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.960
Say, thank you, Lord.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920
Thank you, Lord, for your work in my life.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.840
Let me say this, number nine, He provides for us.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.520
I'm so thankful for His provision.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.600
This evening, I'm not simply speaking

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.960
of any sort of monetary provision,

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.160
though we could understand that to be the case.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.240
But I want you to notice back in Ephesians 1, if you will,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.440
and I want you to see what the Word of God says here

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.360
with regard to the provision in which my mind

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.120
is thinking of this evening.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.160
We'll mention briefly Philippians 4

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.560
as He speaks about that monetary blessing.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.600
But notice here in Ephesians 1,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.040
the Bible says this in verse number three.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.080
Ephesians 1 and verse number three.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.980
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.840
notice this,

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.100
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.340
in heavenly places in Christ.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.140
And you think about the provision,

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.060
the spiritual provision.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.180
You think about this.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.640
You couple that verse with 2 Peter 1

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.780
and verse number 3,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.240
and we read that just a few moments ago

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.480
by way of introduction,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.860
but in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 3,

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.980
the Bible says this,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.180
according as His divine power,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.400
notice what it says,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.100
hath given unto us all things

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.420
that pertain unto life and godliness

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.760
through the knowledge of Him

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.700
that hath called us to glory and virtue.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.940
I'm thankful for the provision of God,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.420
the spiritual provision.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.420
I'm thankful that God has provided us

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.180
with the Word of God.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.940
I'm thankful that God has given us

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.180
the Spirit of God

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.740
who is our divine teacher.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.820
I'm thankful that God in His wisdom

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.180
has blessed us with spiritual teachers

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.220
and instructors,

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.940
and He's equipped the church

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.500
with pastors and teachers.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.380
Why? Because that's the way

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.820
that God is providing for us spiritually.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.420
What a joy!

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.100
What a blessing!

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.300
In Philippians 4,

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.820
we notice here in this portion of Scripture

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.900
that Paul is communicating with these believers,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.460
and he's rejoicing in the goodness of God

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.100
and the provision of God

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.940
and how God used this church at Philippi

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:36.260
to help in His time of need.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.660
He says this in v. 15,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.660
Now ye Philippians know also

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.300
that in the beginning of the Gospel

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.060
when I departed from Macedonia,

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.660
no church communed it with me

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.540
as concerning giving and receiving,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.420
but ye only.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.180
He's commending them for that.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.060
He says, for even in Thessalonica,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.860
ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.940
They were mindful of the opportunity

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.340
that God had given them

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.380
to be a blessing to the man of God.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.100
And it says this in v. 17,

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.860
Not because I desire a gift,

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.700
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account,

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.300
but I have all that abound.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.860
I am full, having received of Epaphroditus

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.660
the things which were sent from you,

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.020
an odor of a sweet smell,

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.220
a sacrifice acceptable,

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.860
well-pleasing to God.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.740
That's how he describes the sacrifice,

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.340
the giving of the believers in Philippi.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.260
And what a great truth.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.500
But then notice what he says in v. 19,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.020
But my God shall supply all your need

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.660
according to His riches in glory

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.700
by Christ Jesus.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.500
We often refer to the fact

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.940
that He owns the cattle on a thousand hills.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.540
He owns the hills as well.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.500
He owns everything.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.860
He has no need.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.380
He has no situation that He can't take care of.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.420
And He will supply.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.180
If you're reading our daily devotional,

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.180
you read about that individual

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.300
that gave that gold piece.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.660
And he gave that gold piece.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.420
And man, he got back, I think it was 12,

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.420
and then there were two more,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.780
so he got 14 for one.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.500
And he gave it to that widow.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.180
And the widow said, I'm gonna pray for you.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.940
I'm gonna pray God's blessing.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.740
And he got 14 pieces of gold.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.580
He had given one.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.780
He thought, this is wonderful.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.420
And then he found out just a short time later

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.660
that there was an estate that was left,

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.100
and they left, I think it was 512

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.980
or something like that pieces of gold.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.940
Huh.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.460
You can't outgive God.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.020
And we can rejoice in God's provision monetarily,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.260
and we ought to rejoice in His provision

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.020
and the way that He takes care of us

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.980
and how good He's been to us.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.780
But I want you to think this evening

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.620
of how He's provided for us spiritually

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.540
as we mentioned in Ephesians 1

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.020
and in 2 Peter 1.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.340
He has given us all things

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.260
that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.300
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.380
And I hope that you'd be thankful for that promise.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.260
He's promised that He has given us those things.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.620
Let me say this.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.380
As we think about our Christian life,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.780
He has promised that our labor is not in vain.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.540
Our labor is not in vain, number 10.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.540
You know, there are times in which we can serve

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.060
and we can get overwhelmed

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.580
and we can look at the things

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.140
that we're seeking to accomplish

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.220
and we can feel as if, is it even working?

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.220
Is there even any purpose?

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.180
Is there any progress that's being made?

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.460
But 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 58

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.860
reminds us that God has promised to us

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.420
that our labor, our work is not in vain in the Lord.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.700
He says this,

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.420
therefore, my beloved brethren,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.220
be steadfast, unmovable,

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.980
always abounding in the work of the Lord.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.940
Why?

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.340
For as much as you know

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.340
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.540
There are times in which we may think

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.780
that our labor, it's not working.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.820
I've prayed for, I've sought to give the truth

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.620
and it just seems like it's falling on deaf ears.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.580
It feels like there's no progress that's being made.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.700
Listen, God tells us our labor's not in vain in the Lord.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.980
God blesses and God rewards.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.500
And our duty is not the fruit.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.780
Our duty is to do the work that He's called us to do.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.620
Remember, He told us in this church

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.820
and earlier in this particular letter,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.700
He said, listen, some plant, some water,

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.180
but God gives the increase.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.220
There are times in which we can go

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.340
and we can distribute literature

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.700
and we can talk to people and we can give truth

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.420
and we can say, is it even working?

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.900
They say, listen, our labor's not in vain in the Lord.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.020
God is working.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.900
God is at work.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.380
Sometimes we don't always see how God is working.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.820
But we can rejoice in knowing that God is at work.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.580
And He said that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.380
Number 11, I want you to consider this.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.900
He tells us this promise

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.060
that the second death has no power over us.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.420
The second death has no power over us.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.340
If you're saved this evening,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.460
look at Revelation chapter number 20

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.980
and rejoice in this wonderful truth

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.340
that the second death has no power over you.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.820
The reality is that we've said many times over the years

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.500
to be born once is to die twice,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.300
but to be born twice is to die but once.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.300
We understand that there's a physical birth

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.940
and there's a physical death.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.580
There is a spiritual birth and there is a spiritual death.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.100
The Bible speaks of all of those things.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.780
And if you're born just once,

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.540
you only have a physical birth,

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.620
then you'll die twice.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.620
You'll die a physical death and you'll die a spiritual death.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.100
However, we can rejoice greatly this evening

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.780
that because He promised to save us

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.900
and all that we mentioned that He does

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.740
as we walk with Him and the work that He does through us,

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.660
that we know that He said

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.660
the second death has no power over us

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.140
because I've been born physically

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.420
and I've been born spiritually.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.820
And I'm only gonna ever die a physical death.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.260
Notice in Revelation 20, in verse number six,

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.100
the Bible says,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.900
blessed and holy is he that hath part

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.620
in the first resurrection.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.620
On such, the second death hath no power.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.300
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.900
The Bible tells us at the end of this chapter

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.420
in Revelation 20, verses 11 through 15,

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.260
it gives us the picture,

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.660
the event of that great white throne judgment

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.700
where death and hell are cast into like a fire.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.940
This is the second death,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:13.500
according to verse number 14 of Revelation 20.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.260
But those of us that have been born again,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.660
those of us that have placed our faith and trust

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.780
in Jesus Christ,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.700
remember what Jesus said to Nicodemus

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.100
in John chapter number three,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.620
He comes to Jesus by night.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.100
He says, I know, we know that you're a teacher sent from God

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.740
and Jesus said, except you be born again,

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.420
you cannot see the kingdom of God.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.460
Marvel not that I said unto thee,

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.940
you must be born again.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.100
How is it that I could be born again, right?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.619
Nicodemus is an understanding.

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:45.179
And we understand that the second birth,

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:48.619
being born again is salvation.

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:52.260
It's that moment that we trust Christ as our savior.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.540
I have a birthday and it's my physical birthday

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.940
and I'm mindful of that date, July 15th,

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.580
the day in which I entered into this world physically.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.179
But of really greater significance in my mind

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.900
is the date August 31st,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.820
because that's when I was born again.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.179
It was 17 years later,

00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:18.940
but I'm thankful for that date when I was born again.

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:23.299
And we understand this evening all of those things

00:39:23.299 --> 00:39:26.380
that He has promised to do in and through us

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.540
and the promises that we've rehearsed,

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.220
but then as we get to the end of our walk with God,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.059
we understand that He says

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:37.140
that the second death has no power over us.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.260
Let me tell you this,

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.260
and you're well familiar with this promise.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.540
Number 12, if you're taking notes,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.380
He promised to return for us.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.980
He promised to return for us.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.260
We're familiar with this promise.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.700
In John 14, in verses one through three,

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.540
Jesus says,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.059
let not your heart be troubled.

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:59.380
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.420
In my Father's house.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.580
house or many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.960
place for you and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:18.060
unto myself that where I am there you may be also." What great promise. We

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:22.140
mentioned this morning in 2nd Peter 3 in verse 9 dealing with the long

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:27.740
suffering of God and it says that our God He is not slack concerning His

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.800
promises. Some men count slackness but His long-suffering to us were not

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.860
willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. Listen, He

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:41.660
has promised that He's going to return and we can rejoice that He indeed is

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:47.020
going to return. We don't know the day nor the hour, no man does, but I want you

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:52.440
to be mindful of what the Bible says in 1st Thessalonians 4. The picture, the

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.500
truth, the teaching here of the rapture and we can rejoice in this promise of

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.200
His return and we can look at verses 13 through 18 but for sake of time this

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:08.600
evening let me just draw your attention to verse number 17 of 1st Thessalonians

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.720
chapter number 4. His return for us, He's promised that He's going to return for

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.200
us. It says this in 1st Thessalonians 4 and 17,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.600
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.420
clouds to meet the Lord in the air and then notice this last phrase and so

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:35.940
shall we ever be with the Lord. He's promised He's coming back for us. I don't

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:41.380
know when but I'm looking forward to it aren't you? And we find that He's

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.580
promised to return. Number 13, He's promised that we'll have a glorified

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:48.220
body. I mentioned this morning about riding a horse I said I'm glad I'm not

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.500
gonna do that in this body but the reality is that we have a glorified body

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.160
that one day we will have. The Bible tells us in 1st Corinthians chapter

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.200
number 15 that this mortal shall put on immortality, that this corruption shall

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.800
put on incorruption and I'm so thankful that 1st John tells us that when we see

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.380
Him we shall be like Him and what a wonderful truth that we have in the Word

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:19.200
of God that we're going to receive a glorified body. That He talks to us in

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.960
Revelation about sickness and pain and all of those things being no more and we

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.920
understand that we don't have that glorified body yet but He's promised

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:34.480
that He's going to give us one and I'm so thankful for that wonderful promise.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:40.160
Let me close with these two thoughts this evening. Number 14, if you're taking

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.400
notes, He's promised that we will reign with Him, that we'll reign with Him. I

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.000
purposefully did not read all of Revelation 20 in verse number 6 but if

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.080
you draw your attention back to that verse of Scripture when it speaks about

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:02.560
the fact that the second death hath no power over us and how we can rejoice in

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:09.720
that truth, verse 6 concludes by saying this, but they, those that are blessed and

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.720
holy because they're part of the first resurrection, those of us that have

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.000
trust that Jesus Christ is our personal Savior, they shall be priests of God and

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.200
of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years. That's wonderful. I mean,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.920
I don't know all that we're gonna do but it doesn't really matter. We're gonna

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:40.360
reign with Him. He's promised us this. Listen, our future is bright. Amen? I mean,

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.800
think about all that we mentioned from salvation. He saved us but then all that

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.640
He's doing in and through us and how He's working and He's empowered us and

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.160
sin has no dominion over us and all those things that we've mentioned and

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.360
then to understand that He's coming back for us. He's gonna give us this glorified

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:04.600
body. We're gonna reign with Him. What a joy. And finally this evening, eternity

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.480
with my Savior. He's promised me. He's promised you if you've trusted Him as

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.080
your Savior that you'll spend eternity with Him. We read the last part of 1

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.200
Thessalonians 4 and verse number 17 when the Bible says, there and so shall we

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:24.920
ever be with the Lord. You know, many times people ask the question, what is

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:34.080
heaven like? There are individuals that have sought to write books and sell

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.440
books about being in heaven and Paul couldn't talk about it and so I don't

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:47.000
think anyone else could talk about it. Amen? The reality is that God tells us

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.600
some things about heaven but you know what makes heaven heaven? We're gonna be

00:44:52.600 --> 00:45:02.920
with Him. If you remove Him, it's not heaven. It's not heaven. But the reality

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.040
that for all of eternity and it's hard for our minds to really grasp eternity

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:16.080
because we're stuck in time. I love the the last verse. I think it's the last

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.600
verse in our hymnal. I know Amazing Grace. It depends what hymnal you look in.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.400
There's a ton of verses to it but it speaks about the fact that when we've

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.040
been there for 10,000 years, right? We still don't have any less time than when

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.880
we first began because it's forever and ever and ever that we're gonna be with

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.560
Him. Paul said in 1st 2nd Corinthians 5 verse number 8 that he was confident of

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.720
this to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. But I want to

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.040
draw your attention to Revelation 21 just as we close this evening and

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.680
looking at a few verses of Scripture. Revelation 21 beginning in verse number

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:03.600
1. The Bible says, and I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.960
the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.600
holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.160
adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:25.440
the tabernacle of God is with men and He will dwell with them and they shall be

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:32.840
His people and God Himself shall be with them and be their God. God shall wipe

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.480
away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.080
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.160
passed away. And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:52.200
new. And He said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And He said

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.920
unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.520
Him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.440
overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be His God and He shall be my Son.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:12.320
And you notice several times there in verse number 3 specifically speaking

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.680
about the fact that He will dwell with them. They shall be His people and God

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:25.360
Himself shall be with them and be their God. Our future is bright. I understand

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:30.800
at times in this life that we can get bogged down and we can see all of these

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.380
things that are around us and we can see these these circumstances and all of

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:41.000
these these things are just temporary. They're just temporary and I don't use

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.640
that phraseology to to try to minimize them but I simply say let's maximize

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.320
eternity. Let's turn our attention as 2nd Corinthians 4 says to those things

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.560
which are eternal not to the things that are temporal and let us be mindful.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.240
Listen, He's given us a book. He's preserved it. He's told us that it's

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:04.440
powerful and contained within this precious Bible are exceeding great and

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:11.040
precious promises. I've just given you a few this evening but I hope with the few

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.960
that I've given you that your hearts been encouraged. That from the moment of

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:21.080
salvation into the moment in which we'll reign with Him and be with Him

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.800
forever all of those things that He's promised that He's doing in and through

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:33.400
us. It's a blessing and when I focus my attention upon my future, when I focus my

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:39.280
attention upon my God, when I am taking to heart the truth looking unto Jesus

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:46.640
the author and finisher of our faith, how my heart can rejoice in the midst of

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.840
turmoil, chaos, confusion, all kinds of craziness. I can have a heart that

00:48:52.840 --> 00:49:01.160
rejoices. Why? Because I got some promises that are precious. He is precious.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:09.040
Remember, why is it that we rejoice? For His person, because of who He is. Why is

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.760
it that I rejoice? Because of His presence, because He's promised to be

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.840
with me. That wasn't part of my list because we dealt with it this morning,

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:24.440
but what a great promise. And then all of these promises, I hope this evening, I

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.760
hope this week, I hope all of our days, not just at Thanksgiving time, but as the

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.640
people of God were to be a thankful people, always in everything give thanks.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.720
This is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Amen? And we're to rejoice

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:53.280
evermore. This is the day which the Lord hath made. I will rejoice and be glad in

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:02.280
it. We have much to be thankful for. The list could go on.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.480
and on and on. As I concluded this morning, I haven't really dealt with all

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.720
the things that He's done for me and given me and all of these

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:19.600
wonderful things that He has, who He is, but then what He's done. And I hope this

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:28.040
evening that we're mindful and we're rejoicing because our God, He is precious.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:35.480
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I pray that, Lord, our hearts

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:47.320
have been encouraged today as we've considered Your person, Your presence, and

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:54.960
Your promises. Oh God, I pray that our hearts have been encouraged, strengthened.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:07.480
I pray that we would be a rejoicing people, understanding that these truths

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:16.920
that we've examined today are not impacted by the shifting sands of this

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:25.040
world. You remain unchanged. You're immutable. Your promises, they are sure.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:35.920
Your presence is absolutely certain. God, would You help us to rejoice greatly?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.720
There's one present here that's not sure of heaven, one that's tuned in via

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:46.400
livestream that's not sure of heaven. God, it is our prayer that today would be the

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:56.280
day of their salvation. The Word of God says, behold, today is the day of salvation.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:04.360
What a joy it would be to hear the news of a sinner being saved. And if there's one

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:10.240
that's never been saved, they don't know these promises that we've spoken of this

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:18.080
evening. God, would You help them to understand their need for Christ? Work as only You can

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.680
work and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me?
