1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
night is to get through the entire chapter of Genesis 40 and we'll be making a couple

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,880
of applications as we look at this portion of scripture and I mentioned this morning

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,680
as we dealt with that passage in 1 Peter chapter number 1 of the importance of rejoicing through

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,600
trials and I told you that the messages today both this morning and this evening are complementary.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,399
They are stand-alone messages but they certainly complement one another and as we looked at

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,840
those three truths this morning as to why we can rejoice in the midst of trials we remember

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,360
our position in Christ and we remember the power of God and then as we look at that we

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,040
recognize that God has a purpose in everything that he allows in our lives and as we understand

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,200
the ability to rejoice through trials we then look at this passage of scripture this evening

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,360
in Genesis chapter number 40 and deal with faithful through trials being faithful through

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,319
trials I mentioned this this morning I believe the enemy wants us to quit I believe that

12
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:04,879
there are times as we go through life you think about the Apostle Paul on his journeys

13
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,599
the missionary journeys and all of the adversity and difficulty and trials that he faced and

14
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,519
no doubt there was pressure on the Apostle Paul to quit to just stop we mentioned this

15
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,519
morning about the disciples in Acts chapter number 5 they were preaching they filled Jerusalem

16
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,839
with their doctrine and they were beaten because of that they were commanded not to

17
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:30,519
teach in his name any longer and yet they depart rejoicing and then immediately going

18
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:37,559
out in teaching and preaching the Lord Jesus Christ and we find that those religious leaders

19
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:42,519
they wanted the disciples to quit doing what they were doing to quit propagating the truth

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,680
of the gospel and preaching what Christ had given them to preach and so we find that still

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,040
today the enemy desires that you would quit that I would quit that we just say you know

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,879
what it's not really worth it but I will tell you this evening with full assurance it is

23
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:06,040
absolutely worth running your race and running it to completion and being faithful unto death

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,479
I am thankful that we serve a God who is faithful and you think about the faithfulness of God

25
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,800
we sing great is thy faithfulness and what a wonderful hymn it is and to remind ourselves

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,639
of our faithful God first Thessalonians 5 24 says faithful is he that calleth you who

27
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,320
also will do it and was a verse of scripture that I claimed as a promised verse when I

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,479
went to Bible college and God called me and I didn't understand all that that meant and

29
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,800
I just trust it that God the faithful God that he would give all that I needed when

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,000
I needed it and you know when you look at your walk with God you'll find that God is

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,399
faithful he's faithful he's trustworthy he's dependable and I am so thankful that we serve

32
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:57,360
a God who is faithful he then calls us as his people to be faithful that we would be

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,160
faithful as we begin to think about being faithful and thinking about the importance

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,399
of being faithful through trials I believe that here in Genesis chapter number 40 we

35
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:13,000
see an example of Joseph and of course Joseph in chapter number 39 was falsely accused by

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,320
Potiphar's wife he ends up he finds himself in prison of course prior to that he ends

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,000
up in Egypt because he was sold into slavery by his brothers and all of these things seeming

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,639
to stack against him if you will but we find that even as he's there and he's in the prison

39
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,440
the 39th chapter of the book of Genesis finishes with this reminder to us that the Lord was

40
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:42,320
with him and I'm so thankful that God was with Joseph as he's there in the prison and

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,559
we begin to chapter number 40 and it tells us and it came to pass after these things

42
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:51,240
we don't know exactly how much time has passed but it says after the butler of the king of

43
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,679
Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt and Pharaoh was wroth against

44
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:00,520
two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,360
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison and then

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,320
notice this phrase the place where Joseph was bound the place where Joseph was bound

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,399
it tells us in verse number four in the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them and

48
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:22,079
he served them and they continued a season in ward as we look at Genesis chapter number

49
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,359
40 we find the entire chapter that Joseph is in prison in fact as you start chapter

50
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:31,079
number 41 you find that it was two more years after the conclusion of chapter 40 that Joseph

51
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,799
still is in prison and we find that when Joseph is here in prison in Genesis chapter number

52
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:41,920
40 we read of a man we read of his life and we see that he's a man that's continuing to

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,640
walk with the Lord he's not quit he's not giving up he's not throwing in the towel because

54
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,600
of the lot that he was served because of the circumstances in which he is facing I begin

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,279
to think about this truth and as I think about this passage here in Genesis chapter

56
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:04,000
number 40 and looking at the truth of being faithful through trials through those difficulties

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,600
in the opposition I'm reminded of what the wise man says in Proverbs 24 in verse number

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:18,119
10 if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small if thou faint in the day

59
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:23,119
of adversity then I strength is small now we can look at that from a physical perspective

60
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:27,559
we can think about physical opposition and adversity but the reality is that that is

61
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:34,799
not the focus of Proverbs 24 in verse number 10 it's really a focus of spiritual strength

62
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:38,440
and we find that he said listen the day of adversity will come we mentioned this morning

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,559
it's not a question of whether you will have a trial or I will have a trial it's a question

64
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:50,359
of how will we respond how will we behave in the midst of that trial and as we look

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,600
here in Genesis chapter number 40 and we see the trial the difficulty in which Joseph is

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,440
dealing with but yet we find that he's faithful he's faithful and there's a great example

67
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,559
for us in this passage of scripture I'm going to somewhat quickly go through the dialogue

68
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:13,480
of Genesis chapter number 40 provide you with some details with regard to the chapter and

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,760
then look at some application for how you and how I can through trials not only rejoice

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,640
as we look at this morning but also be faithful through those trials and I'm so thankful that

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,040
our God is faithful and what an example that we see here in Genesis chapter number 40 if

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,559
I said this this morning I want to just repeat it here if you desire if I desire to be faithful

73
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:44,720
through trials then we better learn to rejoice in the midst of trials because when you rejoice

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,399
in the midst of trials when I rejoice in the midst of trials it's going to really help us

75
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:56,079
in being faithful through that trial why because I'm reminding myself that my position in Christ

76
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,440
I'm reminding myself of the power of God I'm reminding myself that God has a purpose and I'm

77
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:08,160
rejoicing in the midst of that trial and it will enable me to have that being faithful through

78
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,600
the trial someone said this I don't want to I don't want to know how difficult the storm was

79
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,239
I want to know if you made it to the other side and there's a great truth in that the reality is

80
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,160
that I understand that sometimes we'll discuss the trials and the difficulties and what-have-you

81
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,519
but the reality is that we will notice the faithful hand of our God as we go through those

82
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,320
trials and it's our responsibility to be faithful to the Lord as we look at this passage and kind

83
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,799
of dissect it very quickly this evening the first five verses provide for us the record if you're

84
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:43,959
taking notes number one being the incarceration of Pharaoh's officers two officers of Pharaoh

85
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,880
are introduced to us in Genesis chapter number 40 the butler and the baker we do not know them

86
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,239
by name we simply know them by their office and we know that the Bible tells us that they offended

87
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,839
their Lord they offended Pharaoh in verse number one we don't know their offense we don't know what

88
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:04,480
it was that they did but we find that whatever they did caused Pharaoh to be quite angry the

89
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,559
Bible tells us that Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers in verse number two and it

90
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:17,320
tells us that he Pharaoh sentenced them to go to the prison in verse number three he put them in

91
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,320
ward I want you to notice and I've already made note of the fact that the Bible tells us specifically

92
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,839
that this is the place where Joseph was bound again Joseph is there under false pretenses he'd

93
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,000
been falsely accused and I want you to think about your life and think about different circumstances

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,320
that you faced and how many times somebody might be tempted to say well this just isn't fair and I

95
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,159
don't deserve this and we can take that approach and then all of a sudden we can quit doing what

96
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,320
we're supposed to be doing in the midst of whatever those circumstances are and then God

97
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,799
might not have the opportunity to use us in that circumstance like he could have why because we've

98
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:03,280
just kind of given up because we're just having a pity party because of our lot in life and so we

99
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,400
find that the Bible says that it's the place where Joseph was bound notice what happens again we do

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,440
not know the exact time frame as to how long Joseph had already been in prison but we know that at the

101
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:22,119
end of chapter 39 that God reveals to us that the the Lord was with him and that Joseph was able to

102
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:28,280
find favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison and he was notice in verse 22 the keeper of the

103
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,840
prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did

104
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:41,880
there he was the doer of it and so we find that just as Joseph rose to rank of being a an overseer

105
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,000
in Potiphar's house at the beginning of chapter number 39 we find that through his perspective

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in Genesis chapter number 40 and in the end of 39 as he's there in prison that he obviously kept

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,080
his eyes on the Lord and understood that God was involved in this that God was doing

108
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,520
something. And so we find here that Joseph has risen to this place, so much so that in

109
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,200
Genesis chapter number 40, now think about this, the chief butler and the chief baker,

110
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,840
they've offended Pharaoh, they're cast into prison, into this ward, and the Bible tells

111
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,040
us in verse number four that the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them. And so

112
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,800
Joseph obviously had a level of testimony before the prison, the keeper of the prison,

113
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,120
that he would entrust these men to Joseph's keeping. Now that's important for us to recognize

114
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,320
and understand because Joseph wasn't just walking around dragging his lip on the ground

115
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
and saying woe is me and this is just unfair and I can't believe this and don't you understand

116
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,080
what they said and so on and so forth. No, Joseph must have been doing and performing

117
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,720
whatever duties he was responsible for performing because the keeper of the prison says I'm

118
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,560
going to commit these two men to your keeping. And we find that the Bible tells us in verse

119
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,480
number four, notice right in the middle of the verse, and he served them. And he served

120
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,040
them. That's kind of interesting. As we notice that Joseph is in this position and these

121
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,280
two men, the chief butler and baker, are cast into prison because they offended Pharaoh

122
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,480
and Joseph is committed, charged with their keeping and the Bible says that he served

123
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:28,760
them. He served them. Now they were in prison because they offended their Lord, Pharaoh.

124
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,960
I don't know what they did. We don't know what they did. But Joseph is there falsely

125
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,000
accused and yet the Bible tells us that he served them. He served them. And then it says

126
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,600
at the end of the verse, in verse number four, and they continued a season in ward. We do

127
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,760
not know exactly how long this was that they were there. It seems as if it wouldn't be

128
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,640
an extended period of time, but they were there for a period of time. And the Bible

129
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,000
tells us in verse number five, that both of these men, they dreamed dreams. Notice this

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,560
isn't a dream to dream. Both of them, each man, his dream in one night, each man, according

131
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,540
to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker, the king of Egypt, which were

132
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,120
bound in the prison. And so we see the incarceration of Pharaoh's officers in verses one through

133
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,480
five and verses six and seven. I want you to notice the inquiry of Joseph. Number two,

134
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,600
if you're taking notes, the inquiry of Joseph. In verses six and seven, we find that Joseph

135
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,060
looked upon them and he inquired as to what was going on. It tells us, and Joseph came

136
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,200
in unto them in the morning, in verse number six. And he looked upon them and behold, they

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
were sad. And so we find that in verse number six, of course, we're told in verse number

138
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,520
five that these men, the butler and baker, they had a dream. Each of them had a dream

139
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,520
in that night. And as they gathered together that next morning, Joseph came in unto them

140
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,640
in the morning and he looks upon them. He notices that they were sad. Have you ever

141
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,040
seen somebody that you notice is sad? You can just look at their countenance and you

142
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,560
can have an understanding by looking at someone's countenance, especially somebody that you've

143
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
gotten to know a little bit, you can tell what's going on. And he, the Bible says that

144
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,320
he could tell, he saw that they were sad. And then in verse number seven, it says that

145
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,400
he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his Lord's house saying,

146
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,080
wherefore look ye so sadly today? That's where we see the inquiry of Joseph. He asked

147
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,600
the question in verse number seven because he sees what's taking place and we find that

148
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,840
he observes the behavior of these individuals, the butler and baker. He notices on their

149
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,440
countenance and he asked the question, wherefore look ye so sadly today? You know what happens

150
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,640
for most people when they go through trials? They become very me focused. They become very

151
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,800
self-centered. They become very concerned about what's going on in their life and the

152
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,400
trial that they're dealing with. But we find here in this passage of Scripture, as we consider

153
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,720
being faithful through trials, that Joseph is falsely in prison and he's there and the

154
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,520
Bible tells us that he served them. And then the Bible tells us that he notices that they're

155
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,420
sad and so he inquires and says, wherefore look ye so sadly today? He was not me focused.

156
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,660
He was not self-centered. He was not just, hey, look at all of my problems. Look at all

157
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,180
the things that I have going on. And again, we live in a society that if we're not careful

158
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,980
we can fall into that trap because it's so common. We see that behavior. But Joseph was

159
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,740
a man that knew Jehovah God. He knew the Lord. The butler and the baker, most likely as we

160
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,540
look at them as being Egyptians and what we know of Egyptians and what we know biblically

161
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:38,060
with regard to their practices and their worship and so on and so forth, they were polytheistic.

162
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:45,500
They had a plethora of gods that they served and we find that with that polytheism they

163
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,900
had all of these gods and false idols and deities and so on and so forth and we know

164
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,340
that there's no God but one, that's the Lord Jehovah. And here Joseph is in this place

165
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,460
and he knows the Lord God Jehovah, but there's butler and baker that are there. They don't

166
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:06,220
know the Lord and Joseph is not going to be so self-centered to be like, hey, look

167
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:14,300
I got these problems too and it's this and this. No, no. He says, what's wrong? Wherefore

168
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,460
look ye so sadly today? He took notice of their condition and he cared enough to ask

169
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,940
and I find that as we look at this particular passage and then dig into the remainder of

170
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,700
it, I believe that these few, these couple of truths in verses 1 through 7 give us insight

171
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:44,740
with regard to the behavior and focus perspective of Joseph through the trial. Through the trial.

172
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,740
He's not just walking around telling everybody that he can come in contact with, let me tell

173
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,180
you how I ended up here and let me tell you how bad it is and let me tell you he's not

174
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,020
doing that. We don't see that. In fact, in our text of scripture we see one reference

175
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,020
in verses 14 and 15 as to what he says to them after he interprets the first dream,

176
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,980
but we do find that it's not given in such a way that it's a complaining perspective

177
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,100
in a woe is me type of syndrome. And so we find that as we look at this, the incarceration

178
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,900
of Pharaoh's officers, the inquiry of Joseph, number three, the interpretation of dreams.

179
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,020
Verse 8 through 23, the end of the chapter deals with the interpretation of these dreams.

180
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,060
Notice in verse number eight, after Joseph inquires of these men and says, why, wherefore

181
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,980
look you so sadly today, the Bible tells us in verse number eight and they said unto him,

182
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:40,020
we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it. Now their understanding again with

183
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,940
regard to their culture and what they would do. We find it in chapter number 41 that when

184
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,160
there was a dream, they would have magicians and so on and so forth that would come and

185
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,600
try to interpret those dreams for them. That's what Pharaoh does in chapter 41 when he has

186
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,000
the dream, but there's no one that can interpret. And so they're there in prison and they've

187
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,480
had these dreams and they say, because we're here in prison, we've had these dreams and

188
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,160
there's no one to interpret our dreams. And then notice what Joseph says in verse number

189
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:20,040
eight, Joseph said unto them, do not interpretations belong to God. Tell them, tell me them, I

190
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:28,120
pray you. As I look at verse number eight, I find that Joseph has a confidence in God

191
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,240
being able to provide the interpretation of the dreams for both the butler and the baker.

192
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,480
He's a man that has confidence. He has an understanding of what God is able to do. Remember

193
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,720
that Joseph is a man that's had some dreams. We dealt with that several weeks ago as you

194
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,380
look at his life and you look at that difficulty that he has with his brothers. In chapter

195
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,220
number 37 of the book of Genesis with regard to his dreams, and we've dealt with that.

196
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,060
And so now he says, do not interpretations belong to God. Tell me them, I pray you. And

197
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:06,100
so it's very interesting, no doubt as this interaction unfolds, the butler immediately

198
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,140
begins to share with Joseph the dream. Now that reveals to me that there's a high level

199
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,940
of confidence. If Joseph's just like, eh, you know, tell me your dream and we'll see

200
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,260
what we can, no, Joseph evidently through what we can read in verse number eight, but

201
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,820
the behavior of the butler and the baker, we find that there was a level of confidence

202
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,580
that was communicated to these men with regard to Joseph recognizing that God could give

203
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,059
the interpretation of the dreams. We can look at the book of Daniel and we can see the confidence

204
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,540
of Daniel with Nebuchadnezzar and what a blessing that is to understand the focus. There's a

205
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,299
God in heaven. That's what Daniel proclaims and makes known. And I'm thankful that Joseph

206
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:54,780
here, he's saying, look, interpretations belong to God. Notice in verse nine, the chief butler

207
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,580
begins to tell him his dream. It says the chief butler told him's dream to Joseph and

208
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,100
said to him in my dream, behold, a vine was before me. And in the vine were three branches

209
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,780
and it was as though it budded and her blossom shot forth and the clusters thereof brought

210
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,340
forth ripe grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed

211
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,340
them into Pharaoh's cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand and Joseph said unto him,

212
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,100
this is the interpretation of it. The three branches are three days. Yet within three

213
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,700
days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place. And thou shalt

214
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,260
deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

215
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,059
Now that's a pretty good interpretation. In fact, the butler's pretty excited about

216
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:46,660
that. He's going to have his position restored. He's going to go back. And it's so compelling

217
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,540
that the baker, according to verse number 16, he's eager to tell him his dream as well

218
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,500
because he hears this good interpretation. Before we get to verse 16 and the baker, notice

219
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,179
what Joseph says in verses 14 and 15. And again, this shows the confidence of Joseph.

220
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,379
In verse 14, it says,

221
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:05,519
but think on me when it shall be well with thee.

222
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,179
Joseph was so confident in the interpretation

223
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,459
of the dream of the butler,

224
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,419
that the butler was, in fact,

225
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,559
indeed going to return to his place of butlership,

226
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,399
and he once again would give the cup to Pharaoh,

227
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,399
and he says, think on me when it shall be well with thee,

228
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,239
and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me,

229
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,779
and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,

230
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,239
and bring me out of this house,

231
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,439
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews,

232
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:37,119
and in here also have I done nothing

233
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,719
that they should put me into the dungeon.

234
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,519
And so even though Joseph in verses 14 and 15

235
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,519
gives accurate dialogue with regard to his condition

236
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,059
and his lot and what's happened,

237
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,019
we find that Joseph is not in a place

238
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,659
where he's just given up

239
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,859
on doing what he's supposed to be doing.

240
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,759
We find that he continues to be faithful.

241
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,059
He's engaged.

242
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,539
He's trusting the Lord.

243
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,059
He's giving the interpretation.

244
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,739
I mean, he's not just sitting on the sidelines,

245
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:07,139
so to speak, and again, having a pity party,

246
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,339
and we find that Joseph is in this position,

247
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,479
and he has great confidence

248
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,819
that it shall be well with the butler.

249
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,579
The baker, he's excited.

250
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:20,619
He hears this good report.

251
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,019
So it says in verse 16,

252
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,299
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,

253
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,859
he said unto Joseph, I can almost see in my mind's eye,

254
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,379
in my sanctified imagination,

255
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,619
that he's almost stuttering over his words

256
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,519
to get the dream out so quickly

257
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,499
because he's so excited about the interpretation,

258
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,319
and he wants to share it.

259
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,159
Why?

260
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,259
Because there's some similarities between the dreams,

261
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,659
and he's getting it out, and he's going to come,

262
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,739
and it says that he saw that the interpretation

263
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,059
was good for the butler,

264
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,439
and so he said to Joseph, I also in my dream,

265
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,379
and behold, I had three white baskets on my head.

266
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:56,139
Now remember, as we looked at the first dream there,

267
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,539
there were three branches,

268
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,699
and that represented the three days,

269
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,439
and so perhaps the baker's thinking,

270
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:04,459
man, I'm gonna be released in three days as well.

271
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,299
Well, he was, but not for a good reason,

272
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,859
and it says in verse 17, in the uppermost basket,

273
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:12,259
there was of all manner of baked meats for Pharaoh,

274
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,259
and the birds did eat them out of the baked meats

275
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:15,859
upon my head.

276
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,779
And so he did not give the baked meats to Pharaoh

277
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,539
as the butler gave the cup to Pharaoh.

278
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,739
It tells us that the birds ate the meats,

279
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:27,459
the baked meats out of that basket,

280
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:29,139
and so Joseph answered and said,

281
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,779
this is the interpretation thereof.

282
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,819
The three baskets are three days.

283
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,099
So far, so good.

284
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,459
Yet, within three days,

285
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,059
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee

286
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,019
and shall hang thee on a tree,

287
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,500
and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

288
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,459
That's unfortunate,

289
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:54,419
but just as Joseph was confident

290
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,179
in the interpretation of the butler's dream,

291
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:58,859
he too was confident

292
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,659
in the interpretation of the baker's dream.

293
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,019
And the Bible tells us in verse number 20,

294
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,699
and it came to pass the third day,

295
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,539
which was Pharaoh's birthday,

296
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,099
but he made a feast and all his servants,

297
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,379
and he lifted up the head of the chief butler

298
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,699
and of the chief baker among his servants.

299
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,099
Now, just as a side note,

300
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,979
and we look at this passage of scripture,

301
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,619
and it's another perspective,

302
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,739
but I want you to think about

303
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,699
what those guys did for three days.

304
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,899
The butler, his three days were probably spent

305
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,979
with a certain level of anticipation, excitement.

306
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,459
The baker, on the other hand,

307
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,659
you ever want days to go by fast?

308
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,500
Like, I can't wait for this thing to happen

309
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,619
because I'm looking forward to it,

310
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,779
vacation's coming, whatever.

311
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,299
The butler probably had that kind of a perspective.

312
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,179
The baker, slow down, he knew it was going to happen.

313
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,459
I just wonder,

314
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,179
as we look at this passage of scripture

315
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,500
and think about the perspective of these two men

316
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,579
and how they lived those days,

317
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,539
how different their perspective would be

318
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,379
on that time knowing what they knew.

319
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:05,500
You know, sometimes in life,

320
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,259
people will say something like this.

321
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,419
Pastor, I just wish I knew what was going to happen.

322
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,739
I would tell you that you don't want to know

323
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:12,859
what's going to happen

324
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,259
because it might not be super good,

325
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,500
and then you're just going to,

326
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,660
and it might not be super good,

327
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,299
and then you're just going to have difficulty with it.

328
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,100
We find here that these two men,

329
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,739
they understand what's going to happen,

330
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:29,459
the interpretations have been given,

331
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,699
and now on the third day,

332
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,699
Pharaoh calls for them.

333
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:34,820
And it says in verse 21,

334
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,699
and he, Pharaoh, restored the chief butler

335
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:38,579
into his butlership again,

336
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,119
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

337
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,940
But he hanged the chief baker

338
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,500
as Joseph had interpreted to them.

339
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:50,579
And then it tells us,

340
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,940
yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph,

341
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,579
but forget him.

342
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:58,139
It tells us in chapter 41 that it was two full years

343
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:01,259
after this interaction between the butler and baker

344
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,699
and Joseph that the Pharaoh has a dream.

345
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,419
But as we focus on chapter number 40

346
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,579
and we see the dreams interpreted

347
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,019
and we see what takes place

348
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,380
and we understand what's going on here,

349
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,899
and ultimately as we look at this passage of scripture,

350
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,660
having the entire book of Genesis

351
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,539
and understanding what's going to happen next,

352
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,380
we can see God's hand in this circumstance.

353
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,979
We can see how God was orchestrating things

354
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,059
in the life of Joseph,

355
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,940
and we can see even as Joseph will testify later

356
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,779
in his life when he speaks to his brothers

357
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,419
how God sent him before them to preserve life

358
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,220
and they meant it for evil,

359
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,139
but God meant it for good and understanding all of that.

360
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,179
And we read all the way through Genesis 50

361
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,220
and many of us are familiar with what happens

362
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,459
in Joseph's life,

363
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,979
but I would submit to you this evening

364
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:51,899
that he's living moment by moment,

365
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:54,139
day by day as we do.

366
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:56,380
And as we look at this passage of scripture

367
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,139
and understanding what's happening,

368
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,419
Joseph does not know that while he is in this trial

369
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:05,299
and prison that eventually he's gonna end up

370
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,380
in second in command.

371
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,459
He doesn't know that that's going to happen,

372
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,779
but he's faithful anyway.

373
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
He's faithful anyway.

374
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,699
And we look at the passage of scripture

375
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:19,100
and we understand as we begin to piece things together

376
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,179
in the life of Joseph and we understand

377
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,380
that how he was sold into slavery

378
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,539
and we understand that how he was purchased by Potiphar

379
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:28,979
and then he's falsely accused and he ends up in prison

380
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,419
and then the butler and the baker,

381
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,500
they have disappointed,

382
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,820
they've offended their master, the Pharaoh,

383
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,500
and we find that they end up in the same prison

384
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,539
where Joseph is and God is using that

385
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,259
to allow these people to meet one another

386
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,419
and then Joseph makes a simple request, remember me,

387
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:51,419
but the butler forgets him for two years.

388
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,220
I believe that Joseph continued to be faithful.

389
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,739
I believe that Joseph continued to do

390
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,500
what was right before the Lord

391
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,220
and we find that as I would look at the truth

392
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,859
of chapter 41, that if the butler

393
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:05,419
had remembered Joseph immediately

394
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,179
and when he was restored to his place of butlership,

395
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,979
if he sits there and he says, hey, listen, Pharaoh,

396
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:12,259
I want you to know that there's this guy in prison,

397
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,139
his name is Joseph, he's a Hebrew

398
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,259
and we had dreams and we couldn't,

399
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,380
there was no one to interpret them

400
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,139
but he interpreted those dreams and they came to pass,

401
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,339
I think Pharaoh would have said that's nice.

402
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,339
I have magicians, I have people

403
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:28,940
that can interpret my dreams.

404
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,699
That's nice, thank you for sharing.

405
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,419
But two years pass and Pharaoh has a dream

406
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,979
and Pharaoh can find no one to interpret the dream.

407
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,100
And the butler says, I remember,

408
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,660
you're angry with me, you're angry with Baker,

409
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,220
you put us in prison, we had a dream.

410
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,859
There was a guy in prison that was able

411
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,779
to interpret the dreams and it came to pass

412
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,619
just as he said.

413
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:58,299
So at that moment in time, what does Pharaoh say?

414
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,179
Send for him, bring him here.

415
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,019
And we understand that as we look at Genesis 41

416
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,899
and following and we see all of these pieces

417
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:09,500
come together but Joseph didn't understand that.

418
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,100
The point this evening as we look at this passage

419
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,220
of scripture that we see that Joseph,

420
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,539
though ultimately God's hand was at work

421
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:21,100
and we have the entire record that he was living

422
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,579
moment by moment and day by day just as we are living

423
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,899
and we must have a level of confidence in our God

424
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:31,459
to know that he is working just like he was working

425
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,739
in Joseph's life.

426
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,940
I may not understand all of the ways

427
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,979
in which God is working.

428
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,940
I may not understand, you may not understand

429
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,500
all of the pieces if you will that God is placing

430
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,539
and orchestrating and what he's doing

431
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,700
but I trust this evening and I submit to you this evening

432
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,539
that our God knows what he is doing.

433
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,820
I don't always know, you don't always know

434
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,260
but we can rest in knowing that our God knows

435
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,059
and that should bring us great comfort

436
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,299
in the midst of trials and should enable us

437
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,299
to be faithful through the trials.

438
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,140
Why?

439
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,099
Because I'm trusting my Lord.

440
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:10,179
I'm walking with him day by day.

441
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,779
These unfortunate things have happened,

442
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,020
these trials, these difficulties, these adversities

443
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,779
but I know that God's in control

444
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,419
and I know that God has a purpose

445
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:20,979
and I'm going to be faithful.

446
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,580
I'm gonna rejoice through these trials

447
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,940
and I'm gonna be faithful because I'm gonna see

448
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,460
what God is going to do.

449
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:31,260
I mentioned in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10,

450
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,619
if thou faint in the day of adversity,

451
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:34,580
thy strength is small.

452
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,219
I want you to turn over to the New Testament if you will

453
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,820
in 2 Corinthians chapter four

454
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,940
as we seek to make some application this evening

455
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,779
from this portion of scripture.

456
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,419
This truth that we see in Genesis chapter number 40,

457
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,539
as we said this morning, we can,

458
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,059
it is possible that we can rejoice through trials.

459
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,859
It is possible that we can be faithful

460
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:00,700
in the.

461
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:10,500
midst of trials. We look in 2 Corinthians 4. We mention that the strength that's referenced

462
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,340
in Proverbs 24 and verse 10 is not a physical strength, but a spiritual strength. And notice

463
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,040
what the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4. The Bible says in verse 1,

464
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,580
Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy...

465
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,980
Notice the Bible says we faint not. We faint not. If thou faint in the day of adversity,

466
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,580
thy strength is small. Paul says, seeing that we have received this ministry, as we have

467
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:43,100
received mercy, we faint not. It's the idea of being faithful through the storm, through

468
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,420
the trial, through the difficulty, and we see it outlined for us here in 2 Corinthians

469
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,340
4. Notice in verse 2,

470
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,820
We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the

471
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,860
word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every

472
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:05,100
man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

473
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,500
are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

474
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,860
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto

475
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,140
them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants

476
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,820
for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined

477
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,380
in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

478
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,020
Now notice as we get further into this text, in verse 7 he says, But we have this treasure

479
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,020
in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. He

480
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:48,980
says in verse number 8, We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We are perplexed,

481
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:59,820
but not in despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken. Cast down, but not destroyed. Always bearing

482
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,860
about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made

483
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:12,180
manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,

484
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,900
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death

485
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,540
worketh in us, but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it

486
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,660
is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken, we also believe and therefore speak.

487
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,100
And then notice it says, Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us

488
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,340
also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. Again, we mentioned this morning about

489
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,540
the knowing this in James chapter number 1, and God wants us to know some things. Paul

490
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,700
will say in verse number 1 of chapter 5, For we know that if our earthly house of this

491
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,620
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal

492
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,940
in the heavens. And so Paul says, I know, I'm confident of this, and though I'm dealing

493
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,660
with being troubled in every side, though we're perplexed, though we're persecuted,

494
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,780
though we're cast down, I want you to understand that we're not distressed, we're not in despair,

495
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:16,580
and we're not forsaken, and we're not destroyed. Because I know who I serve. I know what God

496
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,060
is able to do. And we're going to be faithful. We faint not in verse number 1. Now notice

497
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,580
in verse 15, For all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the

498
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,780
thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God, for which cause we faint not. So we

499
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,780
see that a second time in this passage of scripture, that Paul says in verse number

500
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,020
1, We've received this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not. We see now in

501
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,740
verse number 16 that he says, For which cause we faint not. Now remember, Proverbs 24 and

502
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:55,020
verse 10, If we faint in the day of adversity, our strength is small. Paul says twice here,

503
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,860
we faint not. Again, the picture that we see of Joseph, of this continuing, of this

504
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,700
faithfulness through the trial, though he's in prison, he's been falsely accused, all

505
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,820
of these things are taking place, we find that he's still engaged. We find that he's

506
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,180
still inquiring, he's still ministering to others, he's still trusting God, he's still

507
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:22,460
proclaiming that, hey, interpretations belong to God. He's still evidently, as we look at

508
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,380
the passage, he's obviously walking with God and obeying God. In Genesis chapter 40,

509
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,260
and Paul is saying here, listen, we've dealt with some issues, we've had some adversity,

510
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:38,140
we've had some trials, but we faint not. Now notice the rest of verse number 16, But though

511
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:49,540
our outward man perish, and here's the key, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

512
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:57,620
That's the spiritual strength that we need. That's the key to enabling us to be faithful

513
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:08,180
through trials. I don't know that I've ever met someone that says, I like trials, personally,

514
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,220
that I've ever met somebody that says that. And I'll be honest with you, that I am challenged

515
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,779
every time I read 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, because in verse number 10, Paul says,

516
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:26,220
therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,

517
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:33,580
in distresses, for Christ's sake, why, for when I am weak, then am I strong. Paul had

518
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,220
an understanding about the purpose of God through trials and God working and God doing

519
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,300
what only God can do. And so as we look here at verse number 16, and we notice that Paul

520
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,380
says again for a second time in this short passage that we faint not, he says the outward

521
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,460
man may perish, but the inward man is renewed day by day. He then says this, our light affliction,

522
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,500
which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,

523
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,300
while we look not at the things which are seen, but of the things which are not seen.

524
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,020
For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

525
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,940
That God would help us to have an eternal perspective and not be so temporally focused.

526
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,059
But I want to just zero in for the last few minutes that we have this evening on this

527
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:25,620
truth in verse number 16 of how is it that your inward man, that my inner man can be

528
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,740
renewed day by day. How do we receive that spiritual strength to be faithful through

529
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,460
trials, to rejoice through trials? We looked at those three truths this morning on how

530
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,700
we can rejoice, but how is it that I can be faithful? I mean in the midst of difficulty,

531
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,820
in the midst of adversity, when we know that we've been falsely accused, when we know that

532
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:53,700
it's been kind of stacked against us so to speak, how can we be faithful? Can we be faithful?

533
00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:01,380
Absolutely. We can be faithful. And we must have our inner man renewed day by day. I believe

534
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,140
that what Paul is referring here, referring to in this passage of Scripture with the inward

535
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,420
man being renewed day by day, is that personal walk with God. That spiritual strength that

536
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,059
comes from being with the Lord. I want you to think about two passages. We're going to

537
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:22,580
look at one in the book of Acts and then one in the book of Ephesians as we close this

538
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,500
evening. But I want to remind you of Acts chapter number 4. And in this passage of Scripture,

539
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,460
we looked at Acts 5 this morning. But in Acts chapter number 4, again, the religious

540
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,460
leaders are not happy with all that's taken place and the miracle of the healing of the

541
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,540
lame man in chapter number 3 and all of the results of that. And we find that the Bible

542
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:51,300
tells us that they were inquiring, they were questioning, interrogating if you will. Peter

543
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,580
stands up and John is there. And we find that Peter begins to speak and he makes that great

544
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,540
declaration in Acts 4 in verse 12, neither is there salvation in any other for there's

545
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,059
none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. And I want you to

546
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:09,540
think about the strength, spiritual strength of Peter to stand up in the face of this adversity

547
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:17,660
and this opposition and make this bold proclamation with regard to their continuing and following

548
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,220
the Lord. And the Bible says that they saw the boldness of Peter and John in verse number

549
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,340
13. These religious leaders, they saw, it was evident that the boldness, and it says

550
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,580
that they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. And they

551
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,380
noticed this as they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus. They'd been

552
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,700
with Jesus. And so when they're spending time with the Lord Jesus Christ, their inward man

553
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:50,660
is being strengthened and they have that spiritual strength that in the face of that adversity,

554
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,900
when those religious leaders are saying, listen, you cannot do this. You cannot speak

555
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,500
in this name. We're going to do this to you. If you continue, we find that Peter is able

556
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:07,859
to stand up with boldness. Why? Because he's been with Jesus. He's have, he has that spiritual

557
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:13,260
strength to be able to stand in that day of adversity. And notice in Ephesians chapter

558
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,580
number three, if you will, and we won't take time to look at the entire prayer that Paul

559
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:24,460
prays for the believers there at Ephesus, but the first aspect in which he prays will

560
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,299
be the focus of our attention to this particular verse of scripture this evening and with regard

561
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:36,780
to the content of the message, how can you be faithful through trials? Again, the trials

562
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,820
are going to come, the difficulties are going to come. How can we be, how can we be faithful?

563
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,059
Notice in Ephesians three and verse number 16, it says that he would grant you this jumping

564
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,220
right in the middle of this prayer in verse 14. It says, for this cause, I bow my knees

565
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,980
unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. So Paul is praying for the believers at Ephesus.

566
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,739
And here's how he's praying that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory.

567
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:10,859
notice to be strengthened with might, notice this, by his spirit in the inner man. Paul

568
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:16,559
is praying for these believers at Ephesus that they would be strengthened with might

569
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,539
by his spirit in the inner man. I would submit to you this evening that this is a prayer

570
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:27,239
that we ought to be praying one for another. Because as you deal with trials and as I deal

571
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:32,679
with trials, as we're praying intercessory prayer on the behalf of our brothers and sisters

572
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:36,719
in Christ, as we're praying that we would be strengthened with might by his spirit in

573
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,719
the inner man, that's what's going to enable us to faint not in that day of adversity,

574
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,319
in that day of trial, that we would not quit, that we would not give up, but that we would

575
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:53,319
continue that we would be faithful to our God even through the trials. So how are we

576
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,959
strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man? Well it begins by spending

577
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,999
time with God. We mentioned already in Acts chapter number 4 it says that they had been

578
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,439
with Jesus. And when we think about spending time with the Lord, what are we doing? How

579
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:13,999
are we being strengthened? Well we spend time in his word. We spend time in his word. You

580
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:19,599
know we cannot overemphasize this evening how important God's word is in the life of

581
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:28,159
a believer. We need more of God's word, not less. We find that Job mentions about esteeming

582
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,319
the words of God more than is necessary food. Obviously all of us understand the importance

583
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,079
of eating and having the sustenance for the strength and if you begin to think about if

584
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:47,439
you go a period of time without eating, you begin to fast or maybe there's something that's

585
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:53,199
going on and you're not able to eat. You need that nourishment. You're exerting energy

586
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:59,079
and you can begin to feel that you need something to eat. You need some calories. You need some

587
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:05,719
energy. Have you ever felt that way? I didn't drink a lot of water today. I don't know how

588
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,239
you are. I typically drink a lot of water every day and for whatever reason today I

589
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,199
didn't drink a whole lot of water and I was sitting in my office and I just was like man

590
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,639
I need some water. I could start feeling that I was having a headache come on because I

591
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:20,159
didn't have a lot of water and I drank some water and it almost just kind of went away

592
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,919
immediately. I know Mr. Don doesn't like water at all but the reality is that I could just

593
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:33,679
feel I needed something. The way that you feel when you don't eat. You ever hear a kid

594
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,119
say I'm starving? You ever hear a kid say that? I mean they just ate a couple hours

595
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,679
ago. Joseph the other night, I promise you, we had gotten done eating and we weren't done

596
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:45,839
eating for 20 minutes and he's over there pulling out the bread to make a peanut butter

597
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,439
jelly sandwich and I was like son what are you doing? I mean we just ate dinner man.

598
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:57,199
And he just smiles as he's making the sandwich and then he says it's for tomorrow morning.

599
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,439
I'm going to the gym early and so I'm making it for tomorrow. So he's just, you know, he

600
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:04,799
wasn't, but sometimes he does eat right after we get done eating. You hear a kid say I'm

601
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:13,359
starving. I'm going to die. It's probably not true. But I want you to think about that

602
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:21,359
and then apply it spiritually. You know how many times we're starving spiritually because

603
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,159
we're not feasting on manna from heaven? Because we're not being strengthened in the inner

604
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:34,239
man through the Word of God. Listen, I say this with as much compassion as I can possibly

605
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:43,759
say it. So I hope that you receive it that way. A psalm and a proverb a day is not enough.

606
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:50,759
It just really isn't. And I say that with humility and with compassion. There's some

607
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:56,879
people that, you know, I read the psalm for today, I read the proverb for today and that's

608
00:43:56,879 --> 00:44:03,199
good but it's not enough. What if you just had a piece of toast every day? Man, you'd

609
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:12,119
be malnourished. You need some food. You need some sustenance. Listen, we need God's Word.

610
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,479
And if we're going to be faithful through trials, the key is being strengthened in our

611
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:25,459
inner man. The key is feasting on the Word of God. The Bible tells us that newborn babes

612
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:30,099
that were to desire the sincere milk of the Word that we may grow thereby. The Bible tells

613
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:34,139
us but grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Bible tells

614
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:40,720
us that strong meat belongeth to them that are full age. We find that we must be students

615
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,819
of God's Word, that we must feast on the manna from heaven. And as we dig into God's Word

616
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:52,179
and the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to strengthen our inner man and then we

617
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:57,500
face those trials and we face those difficulties and God is giving us the strength so that

618
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:06,459
we do not faint. So that we can be faithful through the trials. There's no doubt in my

619
00:45:06,459 --> 00:45:14,459
mind this evening that you've experienced somewhere along your journey with Christ someone

620
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:23,059
that has fainted in the midst of a trial. This evening my purpose is not to criticize

621
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:29,179
them. My purpose is to say I don't want that to happen in my life. I want to be faithful

622
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:34,299
through trials. Can I tell you that the day to prepare for the trial is not the day the

623
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:43,179
trial begins? Preparation happens way, way before. You don't know when the trial is going

624
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:49,819
to come. That's why you need God's Word every day. I asked somebody this question. Sometimes

625
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:56,940
we treat God and we treat His Word like a spare tire. What do I mean by that? When was

626
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:05,099
the last time you checked your spare tire? For most people, not very often. Now some

627
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,459
people, car people, mechanics, you know, I don't ask them that question. They're like,

628
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:15,539
I checked it yesterday. I'm like, whatever. My car doesn't even have a spare tire. Seriously.

629
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,660
I bought it, the Kia that we have, it doesn't even have a spare tire. I looked in the back,

630
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,819
there's nothing there. They're like, oh yeah, you've got to pay extra for that. Isn't that

631
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:30,579
amazing? But what I mean is that, you know when you look for your spare tire? When you

632
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:37,699
have a flat. The person that doesn't regularly check their spare tire is all of a sudden

633
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:43,220
going to check for it when they have a flat tire. The time that we get into God's Word

634
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:50,419
is not when the trial comes. Say, oh man, I need God now. And I'm going to, no, no.

635
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:56,899
We've had that inner man being strengthened. So that trial comes and we have the strength

636
00:46:56,899 --> 00:47:02,699
that God has given us because we've spent time in His Word and we've been faithful and

637
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:09,179
we've been diligent to study and to apply truth. And then the trial comes and we have

638
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:15,339
the strength for the trial. We're rejoicing in the midst of the trial because I know my

639
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:19,619
position in Christ. Why do I know my position? Because I've been in the Word. Why do I know

640
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,220
His power? Because I've been in the Word. Why do I know that He has a purpose? Because

641
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,699
I've been in the Word and I'm rejoicing and then I'm faithful through it and I see what

642
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:33,779
God isn't able to do. Listen, I'm thankful for the end of Joseph's life. I think most

643
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:39,380
believers are. They look at the life, the account of Joseph and they rejoice greatly.

644
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:45,179
Oh man, isn't that awesome? But he lived it day by day. And I'm thankful that in Genesis

645
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:52,299
40 he was faithful. He was faithful. God was orchestrating. He was moving pieces. He's

646
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:59,380
in control. And He was going to work in such a way to bring to pass, ultimately, His purpose

647
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:05,500
in Joseph's life to save much people alive, the Bible tells us. This evening, I don't

648
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,419
know what God's doing in your trial or in my trial, but I desire as we kind of combine

649
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:17,339
both messages today, I desire to rejoice through the trials. I don't want to be found complaining,

650
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:23,660
moping, dragging my lip on the ground. Woe is me. You have no idea how bad it is. I want

651
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,940
to rejoice. I serve a great God. I serve a God who's able to do anything. Nothing's too

652
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:36,260
hard for Him. I'm going to heaven. Remember what the songwriter said? I'm not discouraged.

653
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:43,020
Why? I'm heaven bound. Amen. How can you be doing wonderful in the midst of your... Because

654
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:50,979
I'm going to heaven. God wants us to be faithful. I'm thankful that He's faithful. Oh, that

655
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:55,619
God would help us in the midst of trials to be faithful. Let's pray. Father, we love You.

656
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:02,539
We thank You for loving us. Thank You for the example of Joseph. Thank You as we can

657
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,659
compare Scripture with Scripture and look over to the New Testament and see the importance

658
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:12,739
of having our inner man strengthened. God, I pray that You'd help each of us daily in

659
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:19,140
our lives to understand how important it is that we feast on Your Word, that we spend

660
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:29,140
time with You daily, quality time, quantity time, that we get the Word of God in us so

661
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:34,739
that we can be strengthened in our inner man so that when those trials come, we can be

662
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:41,059
faithful. I thank You for the example tonight. I thank You for the admonition. Lord, I know

663
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:49,459
that each of us will face trials. And I pray that we'd rejoice through those trials, in

664
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:53,820
the midst of those trials, and that we would be faithful. I pray that You'd work in hearts

665
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,899
and lives as only You can. As we have a moment of invitation, I pray, Lord, that You'd move

666
00:49:57,899 --> 00:50:00,779
and work. We'll give You the glory for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name.

667
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:02,779
Would you stand with me?

668
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:04,779
Heads are out and eyes are closed.

669
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:06,779
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

670
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:08,779
Maybe tonight you just want to come and ask God

671
00:50:08,779 --> 00:50:10,779
to help you to be strengthened in your inner man,

672
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:12,779
maybe to commit to spending more time with Him

673
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:14,779
in His Word.

674
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,779
Maybe tonight your prayer is,

675
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:18,779
God, keep me faithful.

676
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:20,779
Help me to keep my eyes on You, looking unto Jesus,

677
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:22,779
the author and finisher of our faith.

678
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:24,779
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
