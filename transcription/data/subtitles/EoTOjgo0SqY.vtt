WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
night is to get through the entire chapter of Genesis 40 and we'll be making a couple

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.880
of applications as we look at this portion of scripture and I mentioned this morning

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.680
as we dealt with that passage in 1 Peter chapter number 1 of the importance of rejoicing through

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.600
trials and I told you that the messages today both this morning and this evening are complementary.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.399
They are stand-alone messages but they certainly complement one another and as we looked at

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.840
those three truths this morning as to why we can rejoice in the midst of trials we remember

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360
our position in Christ and we remember the power of God and then as we look at that we

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.040
recognize that God has a purpose in everything that he allows in our lives and as we understand

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.200
the ability to rejoice through trials we then look at this passage of scripture this evening

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.360
in Genesis chapter number 40 and deal with faithful through trials being faithful through

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.319
trials I mentioned this this morning I believe the enemy wants us to quit I believe that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.879
there are times as we go through life you think about the Apostle Paul on his journeys

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.599
the missionary journeys and all of the adversity and difficulty and trials that he faced and

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:15.519
no doubt there was pressure on the Apostle Paul to quit to just stop we mentioned this

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.519
morning about the disciples in Acts chapter number 5 they were preaching they filled Jerusalem

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:25.839
with their doctrine and they were beaten because of that they were commanded not to

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:30.519
teach in his name any longer and yet they depart rejoicing and then immediately going

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:37.559
out in teaching and preaching the Lord Jesus Christ and we find that those religious leaders

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:42.519
they wanted the disciples to quit doing what they were doing to quit propagating the truth

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.680
of the gospel and preaching what Christ had given them to preach and so we find that still

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.040
today the enemy desires that you would quit that I would quit that we just say you know

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.879
what it's not really worth it but I will tell you this evening with full assurance it is

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:06.040
absolutely worth running your race and running it to completion and being faithful unto death

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.479
I am thankful that we serve a God who is faithful and you think about the faithfulness of God

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:16.800
we sing great is thy faithfulness and what a wonderful hymn it is and to remind ourselves

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.639
of our faithful God first Thessalonians 5 24 says faithful is he that calleth you who

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:27.320
also will do it and was a verse of scripture that I claimed as a promised verse when I

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.479
went to Bible college and God called me and I didn't understand all that that meant and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:38.800
I just trust it that God the faithful God that he would give all that I needed when

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000
I needed it and you know when you look at your walk with God you'll find that God is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.399
faithful he's faithful he's trustworthy he's dependable and I am so thankful that we serve

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:57.360
a God who is faithful he then calls us as his people to be faithful that we would be

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160
faithful as we begin to think about being faithful and thinking about the importance

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.399
of being faithful through trials I believe that here in Genesis chapter number 40 we

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:13.000
see an example of Joseph and of course Joseph in chapter number 39 was falsely accused by

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.320
Potiphar's wife he ends up he finds himself in prison of course prior to that he ends

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.000
up in Egypt because he was sold into slavery by his brothers and all of these things seeming

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.639
to stack against him if you will but we find that even as he's there and he's in the prison

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:35.440
the 39th chapter of the book of Genesis finishes with this reminder to us that the Lord was

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:42.320
with him and I'm so thankful that God was with Joseph as he's there in the prison and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.559
we begin to chapter number 40 and it tells us and it came to pass after these things

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:51.240
we don't know exactly how much time has passed but it says after the butler of the king of

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.679
Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt and Pharaoh was wroth against

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.520
two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.360
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison and then

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.320
notice this phrase the place where Joseph was bound the place where Joseph was bound

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.399
it tells us in verse number four in the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them and

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:22.079
he served them and they continued a season in ward as we look at Genesis chapter number

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.359
40 we find the entire chapter that Joseph is in prison in fact as you start chapter

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:31.079
number 41 you find that it was two more years after the conclusion of chapter 40 that Joseph

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:35.799
still is in prison and we find that when Joseph is here in prison in Genesis chapter number

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:41.920
40 we read of a man we read of his life and we see that he's a man that's continuing to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.640
walk with the Lord he's not quit he's not giving up he's not throwing in the towel because

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.600
of the lot that he was served because of the circumstances in which he is facing I begin

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.279
to think about this truth and as I think about this passage here in Genesis chapter

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:04.000
number 40 and looking at the truth of being faithful through trials through those difficulties

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.600
in the opposition I'm reminded of what the wise man says in Proverbs 24 in verse number

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:18.119
10 if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small if thou faint in the day

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:23.119
of adversity then I strength is small now we can look at that from a physical perspective

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.559
we can think about physical opposition and adversity but the reality is that that is

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:34.799
not the focus of Proverbs 24 in verse number 10 it's really a focus of spiritual strength

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:38.440
and we find that he said listen the day of adversity will come we mentioned this morning

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.559
it's not a question of whether you will have a trial or I will have a trial it's a question

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:50.359
of how will we respond how will we behave in the midst of that trial and as we look

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.600
here in Genesis chapter number 40 and we see the trial the difficulty in which Joseph is

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.440
dealing with but yet we find that he's faithful he's faithful and there's a great example

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.559
for us in this passage of scripture I'm going to somewhat quickly go through the dialogue

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:13.480
of Genesis chapter number 40 provide you with some details with regard to the chapter and

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.760
then look at some application for how you and how I can through trials not only rejoice

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.640
as we look at this morning but also be faithful through those trials and I'm so thankful that

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.040
our God is faithful and what an example that we see here in Genesis chapter number 40 if

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.559
I said this this morning I want to just repeat it here if you desire if I desire to be faithful

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:44.720
through trials then we better learn to rejoice in the midst of trials because when you rejoice

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.399
in the midst of trials when I rejoice in the midst of trials it's going to really help us

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:56.079
in being faithful through that trial why because I'm reminding myself that my position in Christ

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.440
I'm reminding myself of the power of God I'm reminding myself that God has a purpose and I'm

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.160
rejoicing in the midst of that trial and it will enable me to have that being faithful through

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.600
the trial someone said this I don't want to I don't want to know how difficult the storm was

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.239
I want to know if you made it to the other side and there's a great truth in that the reality is

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.160
that I understand that sometimes we'll discuss the trials and the difficulties and what-have-you

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.519
but the reality is that we will notice the faithful hand of our God as we go through those

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:33.320
trials and it's our responsibility to be faithful to the Lord as we look at this passage and kind

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.799
of dissect it very quickly this evening the first five verses provide for us the record if you're

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:43.959
taking notes number one being the incarceration of Pharaoh's officers two officers of Pharaoh

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:47.880
are introduced to us in Genesis chapter number 40 the butler and the baker we do not know them

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.239
by name we simply know them by their office and we know that the Bible tells us that they offended

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:57.839
their Lord they offended Pharaoh in verse number one we don't know their offense we don't know what

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:04.480
it was that they did but we find that whatever they did caused Pharaoh to be quite angry the

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.559
Bible tells us that Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers in verse number two and it

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:17.320
tells us that he Pharaoh sentenced them to go to the prison in verse number three he put them in

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.320
ward I want you to notice and I've already made note of the fact that the Bible tells us specifically

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.839
that this is the place where Joseph was bound again Joseph is there under false pretenses he'd

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:34.000
been falsely accused and I want you to think about your life and think about different circumstances

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.320
that you faced and how many times somebody might be tempted to say well this just isn't fair and I

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.159
don't deserve this and we can take that approach and then all of a sudden we can quit doing what

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:51.320
we're supposed to be doing in the midst of whatever those circumstances are and then God

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.799
might not have the opportunity to use us in that circumstance like he could have why because we've

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:03.280
just kind of given up because we're just having a pity party because of our lot in life and so we

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.400
find that the Bible says that it's the place where Joseph was bound notice what happens again we do

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.440
not know the exact time frame as to how long Joseph had already been in prison but we know that at the

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:22.119
end of chapter 39 that God reveals to us that the the Lord was with him and that Joseph was able to

00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:28.280
find favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison and he was notice in verse 22 the keeper of the

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.840
prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:41.880
there he was the doer of it and so we find that just as Joseph rose to rank of being a an overseer

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:48.000
in Potiphar's house at the beginning of chapter number 39 we find that through his perspective

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
in Genesis chapter number 40 and in the end of 39 as he's there in prison that he obviously kept

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.080
his eyes on the Lord and understood that God was involved in this that God was doing

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.520
something. And so we find here that Joseph has risen to this place, so much so that in

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.200
Genesis chapter number 40, now think about this, the chief butler and the chief baker,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.840
they've offended Pharaoh, they're cast into prison, into this ward, and the Bible tells

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.040
us in verse number four that the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them. And so

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.800
Joseph obviously had a level of testimony before the prison, the keeper of the prison,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.120
that he would entrust these men to Joseph's keeping. Now that's important for us to recognize

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.320
and understand because Joseph wasn't just walking around dragging his lip on the ground

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.480
and saying woe is me and this is just unfair and I can't believe this and don't you understand

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:47.080
what they said and so on and so forth. No, Joseph must have been doing and performing

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.720
whatever duties he was responsible for performing because the keeper of the prison says I'm

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.560
going to commit these two men to your keeping. And we find that the Bible tells us in verse

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.480
number four, notice right in the middle of the verse, and he served them. And he served

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.040
them. That's kind of interesting. As we notice that Joseph is in this position and these

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.280
two men, the chief butler and baker, are cast into prison because they offended Pharaoh

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:19.480
and Joseph is committed, charged with their keeping and the Bible says that he served

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:28.760
them. He served them. Now they were in prison because they offended their Lord, Pharaoh.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.960
I don't know what they did. We don't know what they did. But Joseph is there falsely

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.000
accused and yet the Bible tells us that he served them. He served them. And then it says

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.600
at the end of the verse, in verse number four, and they continued a season in ward. We do

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.760
not know exactly how long this was that they were there. It seems as if it wouldn't be

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.640
an extended period of time, but they were there for a period of time. And the Bible

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.000
tells us in verse number five, that both of these men, they dreamed dreams. Notice this

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.560
isn't a dream to dream. Both of them, each man, his dream in one night, each man, according

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.540
to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker, the king of Egypt, which were

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:10.120
bound in the prison. And so we see the incarceration of Pharaoh's officers in verses one through

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.480
five and verses six and seven. I want you to notice the inquiry of Joseph. Number two,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.600
if you're taking notes, the inquiry of Joseph. In verses six and seven, we find that Joseph

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.060
looked upon them and he inquired as to what was going on. It tells us, and Joseph came

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.200
in unto them in the morning, in verse number six. And he looked upon them and behold, they

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.200
were sad. And so we find that in verse number six, of course, we're told in verse number

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.520
five that these men, the butler and baker, they had a dream. Each of them had a dream

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.520
in that night. And as they gathered together that next morning, Joseph came in unto them

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.640
in the morning and he looks upon them. He notices that they were sad. Have you ever

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.040
seen somebody that you notice is sad? You can just look at their countenance and you

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.560
can have an understanding by looking at someone's countenance, especially somebody that you've

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.440
gotten to know a little bit, you can tell what's going on. And he, the Bible says that

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.320
he could tell, he saw that they were sad. And then in verse number seven, it says that

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.400
he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his Lord's house saying,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.080
wherefore look ye so sadly today? That's where we see the inquiry of Joseph. He asked

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.600
the question in verse number seven because he sees what's taking place and we find that

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.840
he observes the behavior of these individuals, the butler and baker. He notices on their

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.440
countenance and he asked the question, wherefore look ye so sadly today? You know what happens

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.640
for most people when they go through trials? They become very me focused. They become very

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.800
self-centered. They become very concerned about what's going on in their life and the

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.400
trial that they're dealing with. But we find here in this passage of Scripture, as we consider

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.720
being faithful through trials, that Joseph is falsely in prison and he's there and the

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.520
Bible tells us that he served them. And then the Bible tells us that he notices that they're

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.420
sad and so he inquires and says, wherefore look ye so sadly today? He was not me focused.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.660
He was not self-centered. He was not just, hey, look at all of my problems. Look at all

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.180
the things that I have going on. And again, we live in a society that if we're not careful

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.980
we can fall into that trap because it's so common. We see that behavior. But Joseph was

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:24.740
a man that knew Jehovah God. He knew the Lord. The butler and the baker, most likely as we

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.540
look at them as being Egyptians and what we know of Egyptians and what we know biblically

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:38.060
with regard to their practices and their worship and so on and so forth, they were polytheistic.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:45.500
They had a plethora of gods that they served and we find that with that polytheism they

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.900
had all of these gods and false idols and deities and so on and so forth and we know

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.340
that there's no God but one, that's the Lord Jehovah. And here Joseph is in this place

00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.460
and he knows the Lord God Jehovah, but there's butler and baker that are there. They don't

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:06.220
know the Lord and Joseph is not going to be so self-centered to be like, hey, look

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:14.300
I got these problems too and it's this and this. No, no. He says, what's wrong? Wherefore

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:22.460
look ye so sadly today? He took notice of their condition and he cared enough to ask

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.940
and I find that as we look at this particular passage and then dig into the remainder of

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:34.700
it, I believe that these few, these couple of truths in verses 1 through 7 give us insight

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:44.740
with regard to the behavior and focus perspective of Joseph through the trial. Through the trial.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.740
He's not just walking around telling everybody that he can come in contact with, let me tell

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.180
you how I ended up here and let me tell you how bad it is and let me tell you he's not

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.020
doing that. We don't see that. In fact, in our text of scripture we see one reference

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:02.020
in verses 14 and 15 as to what he says to them after he interprets the first dream,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.980
but we do find that it's not given in such a way that it's a complaining perspective

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.100
in a woe is me type of syndrome. And so we find that as we look at this, the incarceration

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.900
of Pharaoh's officers, the inquiry of Joseph, number three, the interpretation of dreams.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.020
Verse 8 through 23, the end of the chapter deals with the interpretation of these dreams.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.060
Notice in verse number eight, after Joseph inquires of these men and says, why, wherefore

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.980
look you so sadly today, the Bible tells us in verse number eight and they said unto him,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:40.020
we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it. Now their understanding again with

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.940
regard to their culture and what they would do. We find it in chapter number 41 that when

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.160
there was a dream, they would have magicians and so on and so forth that would come and

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.600
try to interpret those dreams for them. That's what Pharaoh does in chapter 41 when he has

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.000
the dream, but there's no one that can interpret. And so they're there in prison and they've

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.480
had these dreams and they say, because we're here in prison, we've had these dreams and

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.160
there's no one to interpret our dreams. And then notice what Joseph says in verse number

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:20.040
eight, Joseph said unto them, do not interpretations belong to God. Tell them, tell me them, I

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:28.120
pray you. As I look at verse number eight, I find that Joseph has a confidence in God

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:35.240
being able to provide the interpretation of the dreams for both the butler and the baker.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.480
He's a man that has confidence. He has an understanding of what God is able to do. Remember

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.720
that Joseph is a man that's had some dreams. We dealt with that several weeks ago as you

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.380
look at his life and you look at that difficulty that he has with his brothers. In chapter

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.220
number 37 of the book of Genesis with regard to his dreams, and we've dealt with that.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:00.060
And so now he says, do not interpretations belong to God. Tell me them, I pray you. And

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:06.100
so it's very interesting, no doubt as this interaction unfolds, the butler immediately

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.140
begins to share with Joseph the dream. Now that reveals to me that there's a high level

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.940
of confidence. If Joseph's just like, eh, you know, tell me your dream and we'll see

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:21.260
what we can, no, Joseph evidently through what we can read in verse number eight, but

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.820
the behavior of the butler and the baker, we find that there was a level of confidence

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.580
that was communicated to these men with regard to Joseph recognizing that God could give

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.059
the interpretation of the dreams. We can look at the book of Daniel and we can see the confidence

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:43.540
of Daniel with Nebuchadnezzar and what a blessing that is to understand the focus. There's a

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:49.299
God in heaven. That's what Daniel proclaims and makes known. And I'm thankful that Joseph

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:54.780
here, he's saying, look, interpretations belong to God. Notice in verse nine, the chief butler

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.580
begins to tell him his dream. It says the chief butler told him's dream to Joseph and

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:05.100
said to him in my dream, behold, a vine was before me. And in the vine were three branches

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.780
and it was as though it budded and her blossom shot forth and the clusters thereof brought

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.340
forth ripe grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.340
them into Pharaoh's cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand and Joseph said unto him,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.100
this is the interpretation of it. The three branches are three days. Yet within three

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.700
days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place. And thou shalt

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:37.260
deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.059
Now that's a pretty good interpretation. In fact, the butler's pretty excited about

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:46.660
that. He's going to have his position restored. He's going to go back. And it's so compelling

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.540
that the baker, according to verse number 16, he's eager to tell him his dream as well

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.500
because he hears this good interpretation. Before we get to verse 16 and the baker, notice

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.179
what Joseph says in verses 14 and 15. And again, this shows the confidence of Joseph.

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:01.379
In verse 14, it says,

00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:05.519
but think on me when it shall be well with thee.

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:08.179
Joseph was so confident in the interpretation

00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:09.459
of the dream of the butler,

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.419
that the butler was, in fact,

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.559
indeed going to return to his place of butlership,

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:18.399
and he once again would give the cup to Pharaoh,

00:20:18.399 --> 00:20:23.399
and he says, think on me when it shall be well with thee,

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:27.239
and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me,

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:28.779
and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:31.239
and bring me out of this house,

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:34.439
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews,

00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:37.119
and in here also have I done nothing

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:39.719
that they should put me into the dungeon.

00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.519
And so even though Joseph in verses 14 and 15

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:46.519
gives accurate dialogue with regard to his condition

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:48.059
and his lot and what's happened,

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:50.019
we find that Joseph is not in a place

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.659
where he's just given up

00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:53.859
on doing what he's supposed to be doing.

00:20:53.859 --> 00:20:55.759
We find that he continues to be faithful.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:57.059
He's engaged.

00:20:57.059 --> 00:20:58.539
He's trusting the Lord.

00:20:59.199 --> 00:21:01.059
He's giving the interpretation.

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.739
I mean, he's not just sitting on the sidelines,

00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:07.139
so to speak, and again, having a pity party,

00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:09.339
and we find that Joseph is in this position,

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:11.479
and he has great confidence

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.819
that it shall be well with the butler.

00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:17.579
The baker, he's excited.

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:20.619
He hears this good report.

00:21:20.619 --> 00:21:22.019
So it says in verse 16,

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:25.299
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:27.859
he said unto Joseph, I can almost see in my mind's eye,

00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:29.379
in my sanctified imagination,

00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:31.619
that he's almost stuttering over his words

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:33.519
to get the dream out so quickly

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:36.499
because he's so excited about the interpretation,

00:21:36.499 --> 00:21:37.319
and he wants to share it.

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:38.159
Why?

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:41.259
Because there's some similarities between the dreams,

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.659
and he's getting it out, and he's going to come,

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:45.739
and it says that he saw that the interpretation

00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.059
was good for the butler,

00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:49.439
and so he said to Joseph, I also in my dream,

00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:52.379
and behold, I had three white baskets on my head.

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:56.139
Now remember, as we looked at the first dream there,

00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:57.539
there were three branches,

00:21:58.199 --> 00:21:59.699
and that represented the three days,

00:21:59.699 --> 00:22:02.439
and so perhaps the baker's thinking,

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:04.459
man, I'm gonna be released in three days as well.

00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:06.299
Well, he was, but not for a good reason,

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:08.859
and it says in verse 17, in the uppermost basket,

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:12.259
there was of all manner of baked meats for Pharaoh,

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:14.259
and the birds did eat them out of the baked meats

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:15.859
upon my head.

00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:18.779
And so he did not give the baked meats to Pharaoh

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:21.539
as the butler gave the cup to Pharaoh.

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.739
It tells us that the birds ate the meats,

00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:27.459
the baked meats out of that basket,

00:22:28.299 --> 00:22:29.139
and so Joseph answered and said,

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.779
this is the interpretation thereof.

00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:33.819
The three baskets are three days.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.099
So far, so good.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.459
Yet, within three days,

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:42.059
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:45.019
and shall hang thee on a tree,

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:48.500
and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.459
That's unfortunate,

00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:54.419
but just as Joseph was confident

00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:57.179
in the interpretation of the butler's dream,

00:22:58.019 --> 00:22:58.859
he too was confident

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:00.659
in the interpretation of the baker's dream.

00:23:00.659 --> 00:23:02.019
And the Bible tells us in verse number 20,

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:04.699
and it came to pass the third day,

00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:06.539
which was Pharaoh's birthday,

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:09.099
but he made a feast and all his servants,

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:11.379
and he lifted up the head of the chief butler

00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:14.699
and of the chief baker among his servants.

00:23:14.699 --> 00:23:16.099
Now, just as a side note,

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:17.979
and we look at this passage of scripture,

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.619
and it's another perspective,

00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:21.739
but I want you to think about

00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:23.699
what those guys did for three days.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.899
The butler, his three days were probably spent

00:23:27.899 --> 00:23:31.979
with a certain level of anticipation, excitement.

00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:33.459
The baker, on the other hand,

00:23:34.819 --> 00:23:36.659
you ever want days to go by fast?

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:39.500
Like, I can't wait for this thing to happen

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.619
because I'm looking forward to it,

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.779
vacation's coming, whatever.

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:45.299
The butler probably had that kind of a perspective.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.179
The baker, slow down, he knew it was going to happen.

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:51.459
I just wonder,

00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:53.179
as we look at this passage of scripture

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:55.500
and think about the perspective of these two men

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.579
and how they lived those days,

00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:01.539
how different their perspective would be

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:04.379
on that time knowing what they knew.

00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:05.500
You know, sometimes in life,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.259
people will say something like this.

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:10.419
Pastor, I just wish I knew what was going to happen.

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:11.739
I would tell you that you don't want to know

00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:12.859
what's going to happen

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.259
because it might not be super good,

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:18.500
and then you're just going to,

00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:20.660
and it might not be super good,

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.299
and then you're just going to have difficulty with it.

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:26.100
We find here that these two men,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.739
they understand what's going to happen,

00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:29.459
the interpretations have been given,

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:31.699
and now on the third day,

00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:33.699
Pharaoh calls for them.

00:24:33.699 --> 00:24:34.820
And it says in verse 21,

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.699
and he, Pharaoh, restored the chief butler

00:24:36.699 --> 00:24:38.579
into his butlership again,

00:24:38.579 --> 00:24:41.119
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.940
But he hanged the chief baker

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.500
as Joseph had interpreted to them.

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:50.579
And then it tells us,

00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:52.940
yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.579
but forget him.

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:58.139
It tells us in chapter 41 that it was two full years

00:24:58.139 --> 00:25:01.259
after this interaction between the butler and baker

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:04.699
and Joseph that the Pharaoh has a dream.

00:25:04.699 --> 00:25:06.419
But as we focus on chapter number 40

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:09.579
and we see the dreams interpreted

00:25:09.579 --> 00:25:12.019
and we see what takes place

00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:14.380
and we understand what's going on here,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.899
and ultimately as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:19.660
having the entire book of Genesis

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.539
and understanding what's going to happen next,

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:26.380
we can see God's hand in this circumstance.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.979
We can see how God was orchestrating things

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:30.059
in the life of Joseph,

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:32.940
and we can see even as Joseph will testify later

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.779
in his life when he speaks to his brothers

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:38.419
how God sent him before them to preserve life

00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:40.220
and they meant it for evil,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.139
but God meant it for good and understanding all of that.

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:45.179
And we read all the way through Genesis 50

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:47.220
and many of us are familiar with what happens

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.459
in Joseph's life,

00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:49.979
but I would submit to you this evening

00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:51.899
that he's living moment by moment,

00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:54.139
day by day as we do.

00:25:54.139 --> 00:25:56.380
And as we look at this passage of scripture

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.139
and understanding what's happening,

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:02.419
Joseph does not know that while he is in this trial

00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:05.299
and prison that eventually he's gonna end up

00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:07.380
in second in command.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.459
He doesn't know that that's going to happen,

00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:12.779
but he's faithful anyway.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.820
He's faithful anyway.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.699
And we look at the passage of scripture

00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:19.100
and we understand as we begin to piece things together

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.179
in the life of Joseph and we understand

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:23.380
that how he was sold into slavery

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.539
and we understand that how he was purchased by Potiphar

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:28.979
and then he's falsely accused and he ends up in prison

00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:30.419
and then the butler and the baker,

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:32.500
they have disappointed,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.820
they've offended their master, the Pharaoh,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.500
and we find that they end up in the same prison

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.539
where Joseph is and God is using that

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:43.259
to allow these people to meet one another

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:46.419
and then Joseph makes a simple request, remember me,

00:26:46.419 --> 00:26:51.419
but the butler forgets him for two years.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.220
I believe that Joseph continued to be faithful.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.739
I believe that Joseph continued to do

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.500
what was right before the Lord

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.220
and we find that as I would look at the truth

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.859
of chapter 41, that if the butler

00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:05.419
had remembered Joseph immediately

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:08.179
and when he was restored to his place of butlership,

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:09.979
if he sits there and he says, hey, listen, Pharaoh,

00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:12.259
I want you to know that there's this guy in prison,

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:14.139
his name is Joseph, he's a Hebrew

00:27:14.139 --> 00:27:16.259
and we had dreams and we couldn't,

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:17.380
there was no one to interpret them

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.139
but he interpreted those dreams and they came to pass,

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:22.339
I think Pharaoh would have said that's nice.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.339
I have magicians, I have people

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:28.940
that can interpret my dreams.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.699
That's nice, thank you for sharing.

00:27:33.019 --> 00:27:36.419
But two years pass and Pharaoh has a dream

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.979
and Pharaoh can find no one to interpret the dream.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.100
And the butler says, I remember,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.660
you're angry with me, you're angry with Baker,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.220
you put us in prison, we had a dream.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.859
There was a guy in prison that was able

00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:53.779
to interpret the dreams and it came to pass

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:55.619
just as he said.

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:58.299
So at that moment in time, what does Pharaoh say?

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:01.179
Send for him, bring him here.

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:04.019
And we understand that as we look at Genesis 41

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:05.899
and following and we see all of these pieces

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:09.500
come together but Joseph didn't understand that.

00:28:10.619 --> 00:28:13.100
The point this evening as we look at this passage

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.220
of scripture that we see that Joseph,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.539
though ultimately God's hand was at work

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:21.100
and we have the entire record that he was living

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.579
moment by moment and day by day just as we are living

00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:27.899
and we must have a level of confidence in our God

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:31.459
to know that he is working just like he was working

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:32.739
in Joseph's life.

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:34.940
I may not understand all of the ways

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.979
in which God is working.

00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:37.940
I may not understand, you may not understand

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.500
all of the pieces if you will that God is placing

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.539
and orchestrating and what he's doing

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:46.700
but I trust this evening and I submit to you this evening

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.539
that our God knows what he is doing.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.820
I don't always know, you don't always know

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.260
but we can rest in knowing that our God knows

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.059
and that should bring us great comfort

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:03.299
in the midst of trials and should enable us

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:06.299
to be faithful through the trials.

00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:07.140
Why?

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.099
Because I'm trusting my Lord.

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:10.179
I'm walking with him day by day.

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:12.779
These unfortunate things have happened,

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:16.020
these trials, these difficulties, these adversities

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.779
but I know that God's in control

00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:19.419
and I know that God has a purpose

00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:20.979
and I'm going to be faithful.

00:29:20.979 --> 00:29:22.580
I'm gonna rejoice through these trials

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.940
and I'm gonna be faithful because I'm gonna see

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.460
what God is going to do.

00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:31.260
I mentioned in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10,

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:32.619
if thou faint in the day of adversity,

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:34.580
thy strength is small.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.219
I want you to turn over to the New Testament if you will

00:29:36.219 --> 00:29:37.820
in 2 Corinthians chapter four

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.940
as we seek to make some application this evening

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.779
from this portion of scripture.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.419
This truth that we see in Genesis chapter number 40,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.539
as we said this morning, we can,

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:57.059
it is possible that we can rejoice through trials.

00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:59.859
It is possible that we can be faithful

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:00.700
in the.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:10.500
midst of trials. We look in 2 Corinthians 4. We mention that the strength that's referenced

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:16.340
in Proverbs 24 and verse 10 is not a physical strength, but a spiritual strength. And notice

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.040
what the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4. The Bible says in verse 1,

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.580
Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy...

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.980
Notice the Bible says we faint not. We faint not. If thou faint in the day of adversity,

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.580
thy strength is small. Paul says, seeing that we have received this ministry, as we have

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:43.100
received mercy, we faint not. It's the idea of being faithful through the storm, through

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.420
the trial, through the difficulty, and we see it outlined for us here in 2 Corinthians

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.340
4. Notice in verse 2,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.820
We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.860
word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:05.100
man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.500
are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.860
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:20.140
them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.820
for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:30.380
in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.020
Now notice as we get further into this text, in verse 7 he says, But we have this treasure

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.020
in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. He

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:48.980
says in verse number 8, We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We are perplexed,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:59.820
but not in despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken. Cast down, but not destroyed. Always bearing

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.860
about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:12.180
manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.900
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.540
worketh in us, but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.660
is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken, we also believe and therefore speak.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:32.100
And then notice it says, Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:37.340
also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. Again, we mentioned this morning about

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:43.540
the knowing this in James chapter number 1, and God wants us to know some things. Paul

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.700
will say in verse number 1 of chapter 5, For we know that if our earthly house of this

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:54.620
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.940
in the heavens. And so Paul says, I know, I'm confident of this, and though I'm dealing

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.660
with being troubled in every side, though we're perplexed, though we're persecuted,

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:10.780
though we're cast down, I want you to understand that we're not distressed, we're not in despair,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.580
and we're not forsaken, and we're not destroyed. Because I know who I serve. I know what God

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.060
is able to do. And we're going to be faithful. We faint not in verse number 1. Now notice

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.580
in verse 15, For all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:31.780
thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God, for which cause we faint not. So we

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.780
see that a second time in this passage of scripture, that Paul says in verse number

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.020
1, We've received this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not. We see now in

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:48.740
verse number 16 that he says, For which cause we faint not. Now remember, Proverbs 24 and

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:55.020
verse 10, If we faint in the day of adversity, our strength is small. Paul says twice here,

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.860
we faint not. Again, the picture that we see of Joseph, of this continuing, of this

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.700
faithfulness through the trial, though he's in prison, he's been falsely accused, all

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.820
of these things are taking place, we find that he's still engaged. We find that he's

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:16.180
still inquiring, he's still ministering to others, he's still trusting God, he's still

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:22.460
proclaiming that, hey, interpretations belong to God. He's still evidently, as we look at

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.380
the passage, he's obviously walking with God and obeying God. In Genesis chapter 40,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.260
and Paul is saying here, listen, we've dealt with some issues, we've had some adversity,

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:38.140
we've had some trials, but we faint not. Now notice the rest of verse number 16, But though

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:49.540
our outward man perish, and here's the key, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:57.620
That's the spiritual strength that we need. That's the key to enabling us to be faithful

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:08.180
through trials. I don't know that I've ever met someone that says, I like trials, personally,

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:14.220
that I've ever met somebody that says that. And I'll be honest with you, that I am challenged

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.779
every time I read 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, because in verse number 10, Paul says,

00:35:19.779 --> 00:35:26.220
therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:33.580
in distresses, for Christ's sake, why, for when I am weak, then am I strong. Paul had

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:39.220
an understanding about the purpose of God through trials and God working and God doing

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:44.300
what only God can do. And so as we look here at verse number 16, and we notice that Paul

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.380
says again for a second time in this short passage that we faint not, he says the outward

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:56.460
man may perish, but the inward man is renewed day by day. He then says this, our light affliction,

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.500
which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.300
while we look not at the things which are seen, but of the things which are not seen.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.020
For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.940
That God would help us to have an eternal perspective and not be so temporally focused.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.059
But I want to just zero in for the last few minutes that we have this evening on this

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:25.620
truth in verse number 16 of how is it that your inward man, that my inner man can be

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:31.740
renewed day by day. How do we receive that spiritual strength to be faithful through

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:37.460
trials, to rejoice through trials? We looked at those three truths this morning on how

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.700
we can rejoice, but how is it that I can be faithful? I mean in the midst of difficulty,

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.820
in the midst of adversity, when we know that we've been falsely accused, when we know that

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:53.700
it's been kind of stacked against us so to speak, how can we be faithful? Can we be faithful?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:37:01.380
Absolutely. We can be faithful. And we must have our inner man renewed day by day. I believe

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:06.140
that what Paul is referring here, referring to in this passage of Scripture with the inward

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:12.420
man being renewed day by day, is that personal walk with God. That spiritual strength that

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:19.059
comes from being with the Lord. I want you to think about two passages. We're going to

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:22.580
look at one in the book of Acts and then one in the book of Ephesians as we close this

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:28.500
evening. But I want to remind you of Acts chapter number 4. And in this passage of Scripture,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.460
we looked at Acts 5 this morning. But in Acts chapter number 4, again, the religious

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:38.460
leaders are not happy with all that's taken place and the miracle of the healing of the

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.540
lame man in chapter number 3 and all of the results of that. And we find that the Bible

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:51.300
tells us that they were inquiring, they were questioning, interrogating if you will. Peter

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.580
stands up and John is there. And we find that Peter begins to speak and he makes that great

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.540
declaration in Acts 4 in verse 12, neither is there salvation in any other for there's

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.059
none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. And I want you to

00:38:03.059 --> 00:38:09.540
think about the strength, spiritual strength of Peter to stand up in the face of this adversity

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:17.660
and this opposition and make this bold proclamation with regard to their continuing and following

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.220
the Lord. And the Bible says that they saw the boldness of Peter and John in verse number

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.340
13. These religious leaders, they saw, it was evident that the boldness, and it says

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:32.580
that they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. And they

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.380
noticed this as they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus. They'd been

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:43.700
with Jesus. And so when they're spending time with the Lord Jesus Christ, their inward man

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:50.660
is being strengthened and they have that spiritual strength that in the face of that adversity,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.900
when those religious leaders are saying, listen, you cannot do this. You cannot speak

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.500
in this name. We're going to do this to you. If you continue, we find that Peter is able

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:07.859
to stand up with boldness. Why? Because he's been with Jesus. He's have, he has that spiritual

00:39:07.859 --> 00:39:13.260
strength to be able to stand in that day of adversity. And notice in Ephesians chapter

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.580
number three, if you will, and we won't take time to look at the entire prayer that Paul

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:24.460
prays for the believers there at Ephesus, but the first aspect in which he prays will

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:30.299
be the focus of our attention to this particular verse of scripture this evening and with regard

00:39:30.299 --> 00:39:36.780
to the content of the message, how can you be faithful through trials? Again, the trials

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:42.820
are going to come, the difficulties are going to come. How can we be, how can we be faithful?

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:49.059
Notice in Ephesians three and verse number 16, it says that he would grant you this jumping

00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:52.220
right in the middle of this prayer in verse 14. It says, for this cause, I bow my knees

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.980
unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. So Paul is praying for the believers at Ephesus.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.739
And here's how he's praying that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory.

00:40:00.739 --> 00:40:10.859
notice to be strengthened with might, notice this, by his spirit in the inner man. Paul

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:16.559
is praying for these believers at Ephesus that they would be strengthened with might

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:22.539
by his spirit in the inner man. I would submit to you this evening that this is a prayer

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:27.239
that we ought to be praying one for another. Because as you deal with trials and as I deal

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:32.679
with trials, as we're praying intercessory prayer on the behalf of our brothers and sisters

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.719
in Christ, as we're praying that we would be strengthened with might by his spirit in

00:40:36.719 --> 00:40:41.719
the inner man, that's what's going to enable us to faint not in that day of adversity,

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:45.319
in that day of trial, that we would not quit, that we would not give up, but that we would

00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:53.319
continue that we would be faithful to our God even through the trials. So how are we

00:40:53.319 --> 00:40:59.959
strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man? Well it begins by spending

00:40:59.959 --> 00:41:03.999
time with God. We mentioned already in Acts chapter number 4 it says that they had been

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:08.439
with Jesus. And when we think about spending time with the Lord, what are we doing? How

00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:13.999
are we being strengthened? Well we spend time in his word. We spend time in his word. You

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:19.599
know we cannot overemphasize this evening how important God's word is in the life of

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:28.159
a believer. We need more of God's word, not less. We find that Job mentions about esteeming

00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:34.319
the words of God more than is necessary food. Obviously all of us understand the importance

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:41.079
of eating and having the sustenance for the strength and if you begin to think about if

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:47.439
you go a period of time without eating, you begin to fast or maybe there's something that's

00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:53.199
going on and you're not able to eat. You need that nourishment. You're exerting energy

00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:59.079
and you can begin to feel that you need something to eat. You need some calories. You need some

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:05.719
energy. Have you ever felt that way? I didn't drink a lot of water today. I don't know how

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:10.239
you are. I typically drink a lot of water every day and for whatever reason today I

00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:13.199
didn't drink a whole lot of water and I was sitting in my office and I just was like man

00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:16.639
I need some water. I could start feeling that I was having a headache come on because I

00:42:16.839 --> 00:42:20.159
didn't have a lot of water and I drank some water and it almost just kind of went away

00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:25.919
immediately. I know Mr. Don doesn't like water at all but the reality is that I could just

00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:33.679
feel I needed something. The way that you feel when you don't eat. You ever hear a kid

00:42:33.679 --> 00:42:38.119
say I'm starving? You ever hear a kid say that? I mean they just ate a couple hours

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:42.679
ago. Joseph the other night, I promise you, we had gotten done eating and we weren't done

00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:45.839
eating for 20 minutes and he's over there pulling out the bread to make a peanut butter

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:52.439
jelly sandwich and I was like son what are you doing? I mean we just ate dinner man.

00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:57.199
And he just smiles as he's making the sandwich and then he says it's for tomorrow morning.

00:42:57.199 --> 00:43:00.439
I'm going to the gym early and so I'm making it for tomorrow. So he's just, you know, he

00:43:00.439 --> 00:43:04.799
wasn't, but sometimes he does eat right after we get done eating. You hear a kid say I'm

00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:13.359
starving. I'm going to die. It's probably not true. But I want you to think about that

00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:21.359
and then apply it spiritually. You know how many times we're starving spiritually because

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:26.159
we're not feasting on manna from heaven? Because we're not being strengthened in the inner

00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:34.239
man through the Word of God. Listen, I say this with as much compassion as I can possibly

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:43.759
say it. So I hope that you receive it that way. A psalm and a proverb a day is not enough.

00:43:43.759 --> 00:43:50.759
It just really isn't. And I say that with humility and with compassion. There's some

00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:56.879
people that, you know, I read the psalm for today, I read the proverb for today and that's

00:43:56.879 --> 00:44:03.199
good but it's not enough. What if you just had a piece of toast every day? Man, you'd

00:44:03.199 --> 00:44:12.119
be malnourished. You need some food. You need some sustenance. Listen, we need God's Word.

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:17.479
And if we're going to be faithful through trials, the key is being strengthened in our

00:44:17.479 --> 00:44:25.459
inner man. The key is feasting on the Word of God. The Bible tells us that newborn babes

00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:30.099
that were to desire the sincere milk of the Word that we may grow thereby. The Bible tells

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:34.139
us but grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Bible tells

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:40.720
us that strong meat belongeth to them that are full age. We find that we must be students

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.819
of God's Word, that we must feast on the manna from heaven. And as we dig into God's Word

00:44:46.819 --> 00:44:52.179
and the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to strengthen our inner man and then we

00:44:52.179 --> 00:44:57.500
face those trials and we face those difficulties and God is giving us the strength so that

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:06.459
we do not faint. So that we can be faithful through the trials. There's no doubt in my

00:45:06.459 --> 00:45:14.459
mind this evening that you've experienced somewhere along your journey with Christ someone

00:45:14.459 --> 00:45:23.059
that has fainted in the midst of a trial. This evening my purpose is not to criticize

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:29.179
them. My purpose is to say I don't want that to happen in my life. I want to be faithful

00:45:29.179 --> 00:45:34.299
through trials. Can I tell you that the day to prepare for the trial is not the day the

00:45:34.299 --> 00:45:43.179
trial begins? Preparation happens way, way before. You don't know when the trial is going

00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:49.819
to come. That's why you need God's Word every day. I asked somebody this question. Sometimes

00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:56.940
we treat God and we treat His Word like a spare tire. What do I mean by that? When was

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:05.099
the last time you checked your spare tire? For most people, not very often. Now some

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:08.459
people, car people, mechanics, you know, I don't ask them that question. They're like,

00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:15.539
I checked it yesterday. I'm like, whatever. My car doesn't even have a spare tire. Seriously.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:19.660
I bought it, the Kia that we have, it doesn't even have a spare tire. I looked in the back,

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.819
there's nothing there. They're like, oh yeah, you've got to pay extra for that. Isn't that

00:46:23.819 --> 00:46:30.579
amazing? But what I mean is that, you know when you look for your spare tire? When you

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:37.699
have a flat. The person that doesn't regularly check their spare tire is all of a sudden

00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:43.220
going to check for it when they have a flat tire. The time that we get into God's Word

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:50.419
is not when the trial comes. Say, oh man, I need God now. And I'm going to, no, no.

00:46:50.419 --> 00:46:56.899
We've had that inner man being strengthened. So that trial comes and we have the strength

00:46:56.899 --> 00:47:02.699
that God has given us because we've spent time in His Word and we've been faithful and

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:09.179
we've been diligent to study and to apply truth. And then the trial comes and we have

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:15.339
the strength for the trial. We're rejoicing in the midst of the trial because I know my

00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:19.619
position in Christ. Why do I know my position? Because I've been in the Word. Why do I know

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:23.220
His power? Because I've been in the Word. Why do I know that He has a purpose? Because

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.699
I've been in the Word and I'm rejoicing and then I'm faithful through it and I see what

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:33.779
God isn't able to do. Listen, I'm thankful for the end of Joseph's life. I think most

00:47:33.779 --> 00:47:39.380
believers are. They look at the life, the account of Joseph and they rejoice greatly.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:45.179
Oh man, isn't that awesome? But he lived it day by day. And I'm thankful that in Genesis

00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:52.299
40 he was faithful. He was faithful. God was orchestrating. He was moving pieces. He's

00:47:52.299 --> 00:47:59.380
in control. And He was going to work in such a way to bring to pass, ultimately, His purpose

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:05.500
in Joseph's life to save much people alive, the Bible tells us. This evening, I don't

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.419
know what God's doing in your trial or in my trial, but I desire as we kind of combine

00:48:10.419 --> 00:48:17.339
both messages today, I desire to rejoice through the trials. I don't want to be found complaining,

00:48:17.859 --> 00:48:23.660
moping, dragging my lip on the ground. Woe is me. You have no idea how bad it is. I want

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:29.940
to rejoice. I serve a great God. I serve a God who's able to do anything. Nothing's too

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:36.260
hard for Him. I'm going to heaven. Remember what the songwriter said? I'm not discouraged.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:43.020
Why? I'm heaven bound. Amen. How can you be doing wonderful in the midst of your... Because

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:50.979
I'm going to heaven. God wants us to be faithful. I'm thankful that He's faithful. Oh, that

00:48:50.979 --> 00:48:55.619
God would help us in the midst of trials to be faithful. Let's pray. Father, we love You.

00:48:55.619 --> 00:49:02.539
We thank You for loving us. Thank You for the example of Joseph. Thank You as we can

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:06.659
compare Scripture with Scripture and look over to the New Testament and see the importance

00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:12.739
of having our inner man strengthened. God, I pray that You'd help each of us daily in

00:49:12.739 --> 00:49:19.140
our lives to understand how important it is that we feast on Your Word, that we spend

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:29.140
time with You daily, quality time, quantity time, that we get the Word of God in us so

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.739
that we can be strengthened in our inner man so that when those trials come, we can be

00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:41.059
faithful. I thank You for the example tonight. I thank You for the admonition. Lord, I know

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:49.459
that each of us will face trials. And I pray that we'd rejoice through those trials, in

00:49:49.459 --> 00:49:53.820
the midst of those trials, and that we would be faithful. I pray that You'd work in hearts

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.899
and lives as only You can. As we have a moment of invitation, I pray, Lord, that You'd move

00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:00.779
and work. We'll give You the glory for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name.

00:50:00.779 --> 00:50:02.779
Would you stand with me?

00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:04.779
Heads are out and eyes are closed.

00:50:04.779 --> 00:50:06.779
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:50:06.779 --> 00:50:08.779
Maybe tonight you just want to come and ask God

00:50:08.779 --> 00:50:10.779
to help you to be strengthened in your inner man,

00:50:10.779 --> 00:50:12.779
maybe to commit to spending more time with Him

00:50:12.779 --> 00:50:14.779
in His Word.

00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:16.779
Maybe tonight your prayer is,

00:50:16.779 --> 00:50:18.779
God, keep me faithful.

00:50:18.779 --> 00:50:20.779
Help me to keep my eyes on You, looking unto Jesus,

00:50:20.779 --> 00:50:22.779
the author and finisher of our faith.

00:50:22.779 --> 00:50:24.779
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
