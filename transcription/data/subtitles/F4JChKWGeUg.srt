1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,639
Chapter number 37.

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,039
And as you saw in the bulletin,

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:03,880
if you look to the back there

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,519
to get the title for the message,

5
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,599
the creator God is my helper.

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,119
And this is part one of part two next week.

7
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,439
And over the last several weeks,

8
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:15,560
as we've started this new year with our new theme,

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,639
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised

10
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,100
from Psalm 48 verses one and two.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,879
And I'm so thankful for God's greatness.

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,700
He is a great God.

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,239
And we, of course, over the last several weeks,

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,479
we have examined the truth of God's word

15
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,279
with regard to creation.

16
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:35,040
And we have acknowledged the fact

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,599
that God's greatness is revealed through creation.

18
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:43,479
And I'm so thankful that as we examine the biblical account

19
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,279
that God has given us of creation,

20
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,759
that we ought to stand in awe of who God is.

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,959
And of course, as we've studied these past few weeks,

22
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,279
the creation account from Genesis,

23
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,119
and also looking at a number of passages

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,520
in the book of Psalms, we've been encouraged,

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,400
and we've also had the privilege of being able to see

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,559
how that God's greatness is revealed through creation.

27
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:08,000
And we spoke about God's great power.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
And I'm so thankful that he is omnipotent,

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,720
that he has all power.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,120
There's nothing too difficult for him.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,599
I'm thankful that he is the Lord God omnipotent,

32
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,160
and he reigns.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,720
We find that not only does creation reveal to us

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,080
the fact that the God's great power,

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,379
but his great wisdom, that God is omniscient,

36
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,680
that he knows all things.

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,900
He has perfect knowledge and perfect wisdom.

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,239
We mentioned several weeks ago

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,559
that God not only knew what to do,

40
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,800
but he had the power to do it.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,639
And if you have omnipotence without omniscience

42
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:45,080
or vice versa, you cannot have what we see

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,019
in the scriptures.

44
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,919
And I'm so thankful that God has the power

45
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,919
and the knowledge.

46
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,440
He is omnipotent and he is omniscient.

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,599
He is our great God.

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,959
And then we spoke about the fact

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,319
that creation reveals to us

50
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,720
that our God is a God of order.

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,879
He does all things in order.

52
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,980
He has purpose in his movings,

53
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,720
and I'm so thankful for that.

54
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,019
And as we've had the privilege

55
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,660
of being able to study these truths,

56
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,839
we often look at those things.

57
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,559
And of course, we can stand in awe of the Lord,

58
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,399
and we should.

59
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,080
We should rejoice in who he is.

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,520
But I've mentioned as we've started this series

61
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,880
throughout 2023 that we want to see God

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,160
in all of his greatness.

63
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,919
And then we want to respond.

64
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,039
How, as we recognize the greatness of God,

65
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,119
how does his greatness impact us as individuals?

66
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,399
And the reality is that God has revealed to us

67
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:39,360
that he is great so that it would impact us.

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,600
And our belief of God's greatness

69
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,320
ought to have a direct impact upon our behavior.

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,199
How does that belief impact us personally?

71
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,600
How does that belief that God is great

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,399
impact our church corporately?

73
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:57,360
How does it work in your family, in your home,

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,759
in your job, in your circumstances in life?

75
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,440
How does the truth of God's greatness work in your life?

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,000
How does that truth impact us personally?

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,399
And so this morning, as we look at this passage

78
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,559
of Scripture in Isaiah 37 and deal with the subject matter,

79
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:19,440
that the creator God is my helper.

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
As I mentioned to you these words from the psalmist

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,279
and what a great proclamation in Psalm 121

83
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,199
in verses one and two when the psalmist says,

84
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,520
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,279
from whence cometh my help.

86
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,240
And then the psalmist says this in verse number two,

87
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,839
my help cometh from the Lord,

88
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:49,880
which made heaven and earth.

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,080
This truth that our God is the creator

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,399
and the greatness of God revealed through creation

91
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,759
had a profound impact in the life of the psalmist.

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,440
And the psalmist recognized,

93
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,839
I'm going to lift up mine eyes into the hills

94
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,520
from whence cometh my help,

95
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,520
recognizing that his help came from the creator God,

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,359
the one who made heaven and earth.

97
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,160
As we look here in the book of Isaiah,

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,399
in this passage dealing with the life

99
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,320
and the rulership of Hezekiah, king of Judah,

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,880
we see that Hezekiah also recognized this great truth

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,559
and what a blessing to think about the life

102
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,160
and ministry of Hezekiah and to think about God

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
placing him in that place as being king of Judah

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
and all that took place.

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,799
And Isaiah is the prophet of God

106
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,559
during the time of Hezekiah's reign and rule.

107
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:47,640
And we find that the Assyrians at this time in world history

108
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,320
are the world power.

109
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,279
The Assyrians had taken captive of many people groups.

110
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,679
We find that they had conquered much land

111
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,839
and they had been greatly successful.

112
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,100
We find that they come against the people of God,

113
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,359
against Hezekiah and the people of God.

114
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,160
And we find that Hezekiah is known for trusting the Lord

115
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,839
and recognizing that God is the creator

116
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,480
and that the creator God was his helper.

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
This morning as we look at the example of Hezekiah,

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,720
next week as we look at another example,

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,700
I hope that through both lessons and both weeks

120
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,239
that we would leave and understand

121
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,320
that the creator God is my helper.

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,119
Personally, your time of adversity and difficulty,

123
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,359
your problems and your struggles in life,

124
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,720
that we have a divine helper

125
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,279
and he is the Lord God omnipotent.

126
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,079
He is the one that said, let there be light

127
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,480
and there was light.

128
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,459
He is the one that created all things

129
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,940
and did it with order and purpose.

130
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,820
And he knows as we mentioned about the stars

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,859
and we spoke last week about the creation of man

132
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:57,200
and what a blessing to think about God's power.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,079
But he's my God and he's my helper.

134
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,559
That ought to encourage us greatly this morning.

135
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,600
As we look in Isaiah 37,

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,480
I want you to recognize if you're taking notes

137
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,940
this morning, number one, the record of great adversity.

138
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,440
The record of great adversity.

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,079
In chapter number 37 and verse number 14,

140
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,720
the Bible says this,

141
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,040
and I'm gonna read this verse of scripture

142
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,839
and then I'm gonna go back to chapter 36,

143
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,399
but the Bible says this,

144
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,799
and Hezekiah received the letter

145
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:30,279
from the hand of the messengers and read it.

146
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,720
So we find that God gives us the record of great adversity

147
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,399
that Hezekiah would face.

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,260
Now before he receives the letter,

149
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,320
we find back in chapter number 36

150
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,040
that God introduces us to a couple of people

151
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,920
and gives us the timing of all that's taking place.

152
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,799
In verse number one of chapter 36,

153
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,579
it says, now it came to pass in the 14th year

154
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,000
of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib, King of Assyria,

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,839
came up against all the defense cities of Judah,

156
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,160
and look at what it says, and took them.

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,559
The King of Assyria sent Rabshakeh

158
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,760
from Lachish to Jerusalem unto King Hezekiah

159
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
with a great army,

160
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,799
and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool

161
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,600
in the highway of the fuller's field,

162
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,399
then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son,

163
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,640
which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe,

164
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder,

165
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,839
and Rabshakeh said unto them,

166
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,799
say ye now to Hezekiah,

167
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,079
thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,

168
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,359
that's Sennacherib,

169
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,720
what confidence is this wherein thou trustest?

170
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,040
I say, sayest thou, but they are but vain words,

171
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
I have counsel and strength for war.

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me?

173
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,059
Notice the thought in verse number six,

174
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:47,239
it says, lo, thou trustest in the staff

175
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,980
of this broken reed on Egypt.

176
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,600
No, Hezekiah was not trusting in Egypt,

177
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,839
and our trust is not in Egypt as well,

178
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,880
a picture throughout the Old Testament of the world,

179
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,760
we find that this was the perception, if you will,

180
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,519
of Rabshakeh and Sennacherib,

181
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,459
but notice what he says,

182
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,640
wherein if a man lean, it will go into his hand

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,000
and pierce it, so is Pharaoh king of Egypt

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
to all that trust in him.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,359
But then it says this in verse number seven,

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,239
but if thou say to me, we trust in the Lord our God,

187
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,040
is it not he whose high places and whose altars

188
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,640
Hezekiah had taken away, and said to Judah

189
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,760
and to Jerusalem, you shall worship before this altar?

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,679
We find that the attack continues,

191
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,239
I'm not gonna read the entirety of chapter number 36,

192
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:36,239
but we find that he, Sennacherib sends Rabshakeh

193
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,320
basically his general to bring this attack,

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,479
and we find that verbally it is given in chapter 36,

195
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,159
we read of those that are there that are hearing this,

196
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,619
we find that they are hearing of all the intent

197
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:52,340
of the Assyrians, and Hezekiah hears of this

198
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,840
in chapter number one, excuse me, 37,

199
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,460
in verse number one, it says, and it came to pass

200
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,380
when King Hezekiah heard it, heard what?

201
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,979
Heard all that Rabshakeh had said,

202
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,739
that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth,

203
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,320
and notice it says that he went into the house of the Lord,

204
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,500
he sent these individuals, Eliakim,

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,460
who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,

206
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,020
those are the same guys back in chapter number 36

207
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,659
that heard all of this, the elders of the priest

208
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:21,080
covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet,

209
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,539
the son of Amos, I'm thankful that he went

210
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,179
to the man of God, to the prophet.

211
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,299
We find that Isaiah gives them a word from the Lord

212
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,539
in verse number six, the Bible says this,

213
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,820
and Isaiah said unto them,

214
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,659
thus shall you say unto your master, to Hezekiah,

215
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,859
thus saith the Lord, be not afraid of the words

216
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,580
that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants

217
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,460
of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me,

218
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,400
behold, I will send a blast upon him,

219
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,619
and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land,

220
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:53,760
and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

221
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,359
I'm so thankful for God's promise in verse six and seven.

222
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,159
I'm so thankful that God used the prophet of.

223
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,079
of God to give the message back to Hezekiah,

224
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,439
the king of Judah, with regard to what was taking place.

225
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,719
But we understand that then as we enter

226
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,559
into our text of scripture that we're focused

227
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,079
on this morning, that Hezekiah then receives

228
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,079
this letter from the hands of Rabshakeh.

229
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,339
The Bible tells us that he heard this report,

230
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:21,359
and then it tells us that Rabshakeh returned,

231
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,399
according to verse number eight,

232
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,839
and found the king of Assyria, that's Sennacherib,

233
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,079
warring against Libna, for he had heard

234
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,079
that he was departed from Lachish.

235
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,559
And he heard saying concerning Terhaka,

236
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,959
king of Ethiopia, he has come forth to make war with thee.

237
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,159
And when he heard it, he sent messengers

238
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,999
to Hezekiah saying.

239
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,519
So we find that Hezekiah had heard from Eliakim

240
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,699
and Shebna and the others with regard

241
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,999
to what Rabshakeh had said in chapter 36.

242
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:52,159
Then Rabshakeh returns, they're there warring

243
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,859
against Libna, and then he sends this word

244
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,279
back to Hezekiah, and it's the record

245
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,279
of this great adversity.

246
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,459
We read in verses 10 through 13 of Isaiah 37,

247
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,599
really the content of the letter, if you will,

248
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,439
because it told us in verse number 14

249
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,939
that Hezekiah received the letter

250
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,599
from the hand of the messengers.

251
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,479
But what did this letter say?

252
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:18,179
It really outlines the Assyrians,

253
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,199
their great military achievements.

254
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,359
It outlines their intent to conquer Judah,

255
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:29,359
and it outlines the inability of other nations

256
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,439
that Assyria had come against.

257
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:35,279
Notice in verse number 10, the Bible says this.

258
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,799
Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah, king of Judah,

259
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,799
saying, let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee,

260
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,999
saying, Jerusalem shall not be given

261
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,859
into the hand of the kings of Assyria.

262
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,639
It's interesting to me that even the enemy

263
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,239
knew that Hezekiah trusted the Lord.

264
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,319
In verse number 10, it says, let not thy God

265
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:55,959
in whom thou trustest deceive thee.

266
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,799
Let me say this, God will never deceive you.

267
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,079
God is truth, amen?

268
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,139
And he is not a man that he should lie.

269
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,319
We read that back in the book of Numbers

270
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,199
with Balaam and Balak and all of that

271
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,679
circumstance and situation.

272
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,379
And we find here that God had given truth,

273
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,319
and Hezekiah was trusting in the Lord,

274
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,839
but we find that this letter comes,

275
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,039
and notice in verse number 11.

276
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,639
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria

277
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,279
have done to all lands by destroying them utterly,

278
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,159
and shalt thou be delivered?

279
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,319
So what is the enemy doing?

280
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:30,679
The enemy's saying, listen, we've conquered

281
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,639
all these other people.

282
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,479
He's gonna outline in verse number 12

283
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,079
those that they've conquered and those that they've destroyed

284
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
and they said their gods couldn't help them.

285
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,119
You notice that in verse number 12, it's a little g.

286
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,639
Our God is the Lord God of heaven and earth.

287
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,599
He's the living God.

288
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,319
He's the one that created the heavens and the earth.

289
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,199
He is the one that rules and reigns.

290
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,039
And we find that these false gods of these other nations

291
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,979
that the Assyrians went up against,

292
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,079
they could not do anything against the Assyrians

293
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,919
because they are not the true God.

294
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,039
So we find that here, we look at the text of Scripture

295
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,639
and it says that Hezekiah receives this word.

296
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,499
You know, the record of great adversity is given to us.

297
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,199
Tim mentioned as he read the letter this morning

298
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,999
from the Brown family, how the Browns in Cambodia

299
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,039
were dealing with some opposition and some obstacles

300
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,959
and some difficulties.

301
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
As you read the word, as you study through the Scriptures,

302
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,459
you find that God has revealed to us

303
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,999
that the work of God is always going to suffer, attack.

304
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,399
It's going to have adversity.

305
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,239
And here, Hezekiah is faced with great adversity.

306
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:48,359
Maybe this morning, you would look at your own life

307
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,999
and say, I'm dealing with some great adversity.

308
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,119
There's just some difficulties

309
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,479
that I'm dealing with in my life

310
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,519
and there's some problems and man, it's just,

311
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,999
man, it is tough.

312
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,919
I'm really going through it.

313
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,419
Sometimes we're in that circumstance.

314
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,559
Sometimes we're in that situation

315
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,259
and there's great adversity.

316
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:08,899
But I'm thankful that in the time of great adversity,

317
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,399
when the record is given to us of this great adversity,

318
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,799
this wasn't something that Hezekiah

319
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,519
was just making up in his mind.

320
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,759
This wasn't something that he was just imagining.

321
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,399
No, this was true attack, great adversity.

322
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,759
The Assyrians were the world power at the time.

323
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,159
They come with a great army, the Bible tells us.

324
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,719
The threat is real.

325
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,999
But we find that in the time of this great adversity,

326
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,799
if you're taking notes number two,

327
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,439
I want you to notice what Hezekiah recognized

328
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:42,079
in the midst of great adversity.

329
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:45,279
What he recognized in the midst of great adversity.

330
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,959
We notice that the Bible tells us

331
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,179
and we're gonna look at in just a moment what he does.

332
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,479
But I wanna focus at this moment

333
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,359
into the latter part of the prayer

334
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,279
that's recorded for us in verse 16.

335
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,199
The Bible says this,

336
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,639
O Lord of hosts, God of Israel,

337
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,319
that dwellest between the cherubims,

338
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,079
thou art the God.

339
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,519
Even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth,

340
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,979
thou hast made heaven and earth.

341
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,339
You know, in the midst of great adversity,

342
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,539
what Hezekiah recognized,

343
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:19,419
what was that he served the living God.

344
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,819
He recognized that the creator God was his helper.

345
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:25,979
He recognized that yes, this threat was real

346
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,899
and yes, he was dealing with great adversity,

347
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,659
but his God is greater.

348
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:32,239
He recognized that his God is living,

349
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,019
that he is God alone.

350
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,459
He recognized that God is holy

351
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,859
and that God is the creator.

352
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,619
As we look at these words of verse number 16

353
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,819
and we recognize that Hezekiah is praying

354
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,219
and as his prayer is recorded for us,

355
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:53,139
we have the insight as to what this man recognized

356
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:55,059
in times of great adversity.

357
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,639
See, we must recognize this morning

358
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,899
that our God is greater than any adversity

359
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,459
we will ever face.

360
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,139
Any adversity that we will ever endure in our lives,

361
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,939
God is greater.

362
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:10,579
God is greater.

363
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,579
And see, we must have the eyes of faith.

364
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,899
We must have the truth of God's word in us

365
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,019
and we must be familiar with the word of God

366
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,799
so that we can deal with those times of adversity

367
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,179
and understand who our God is.

368
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,419
See, because when that time of great adversity comes,

369
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,019
it can consume our focus.

370
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:37,499
When we're in the midst of a great trial,

371
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:41,419
where we focus is of great importance.

372
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,739
So often if we're not careful in the times

373
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:47,179
of that great adversity, we can focus on the adversity,

374
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,699
we can focus on the trial and it can become so large

375
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,939
and so great and it can become so overwhelming.

376
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:58,419
We find that Hezekiah, when he first heard

377
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:01,779
at the beginning of chapter 37, he sent some messengers,

378
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,739
he sent some servants to the man of God, to Isaiah.

379
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,459
And then we find that when he receives a letter,

380
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,499
that he opens that letter we'll mention in just a moment

381
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,499
and he spreads it out before the Lord and he prays

382
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,659
and in that prayer it reveals to us

383
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,059
what he recognized about his God.

384
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,299
Why does God give us the record of creation?

385
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:25,659
Well, He wants us to know that He's the creator God.

386
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,819
He wants us to understand the origin of man.

387
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,179
He wants us to have the truth that He is the creator

388
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,019
and He's provided that record for us.

389
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,999
But then as we go throughout the pages of scripture,

390
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,439
we find that God not only reveals to us

391
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,679
that He is the creator and again, I've said many times

392
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,439
over the years that the record of creation

393
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,759
is not isolated to Genesis.

394
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,999
The truth and record of creation is throughout

395
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,879
the entirety of God's word.

396
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,639
And we find that it's often repeated, why?

397
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,559
Because we as the people of God need to know

398
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,559
that our God is the creator God and He is our helper.

399
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,599
Because when we understand that He could make

400
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,159
everything out of nothing, when we understand

401
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,959
that He spoke and it was done,

402
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,759
as we read in the book of Genesis,

403
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,199
God said and it was so, you read it repeatedly.

404
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,619
When you read the record of creation and you understand

405
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,199
that He is my God and He is my helper,

406
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:30,839
oh, it totally changes how we deal with times of adversity.

407
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,399
The adversity will come in your life.

408
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:37,559
It'll come in my life just as it did in Hezekiah's life.

409
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,759
But I'm thankful in the midst of that great adversity

410
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,879
that Hezekiah recognized that he has a great God.

411
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,279
He is the creator God.

412
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,799
And the creator God is his helper.

413
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,959
Today, the creator God is our helper.

414
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,679
I'm so thankful for that wonderful truth.

415
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,719
And Hezekiah, in the midst of this great adversity,

416
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,319
he recognized that truth.

417
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,519
And so, recognizing the truth of who God is

418
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,379
impacted how he responded.

419
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:11,619
Number three, this morning, we know how Hezekiah responded

420
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,579
in the midst of great adversity.

421
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,399
If we were to examine each of our lives,

422
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,879
if we were to take and to honestly evaluate

423
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:22,879
and look back over our lives and to examine times

424
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,039
in our lives of great adversity,

425
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,919
I mean, when we really face the fire, so to speak,

426
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,319
and we were to honestly evaluate,

427
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,319
how did I respond in the times of that great adversity?

428
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,279
What was my response to that time of difficulty?

429
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,719
Was my response one of complaining?

430
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,799
Was my response one of doubt?

431
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,839
Was my response one of just being overwhelmed

432
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,839
and maybe discouraged, maybe depressed?

433
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,000
What was my response?

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,919
Was my response a response of trust,

435
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,519
a response of expectation, a response of anticipating

436
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,759
how is God going to work?

437
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,739
in the midst of this great adversity

438
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,899
when I can't seem to see beyond it,

439
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,559
what is God going to do?

440
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,759
Because he's the creator God,

441
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,359
and he's capable, he's able,

442
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,859
and he's my helper.

443
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:17,299
Notice how Hezekiah responded

444
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,279
in the midst of great adversity

445
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,279
with regard specifically to the letter

446
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,299
that is mentioned in verse number 14.

447
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,099
We see first of all that he went to the house of the Lord.

448
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,779
The Bible tells us, and Hezekiah received the letter

449
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,299
from the hand of the messengers and read it,

450
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,299
and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord.

451
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,439
Notice what it says, and spread it,

452
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,599
the letter, before the Lord.

453
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,739
He went to the house of the Lord

454
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,339
and he spread it before the Lord.

455
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,099
Now let me ask you this morning,

456
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,819
did God already know about the letter?

457
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,659
Sure he did.

458
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,659
He's omniscient, he knows all things.

459
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:56,879
He knew what was taking place,

460
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,759
he knew how that Sennacherib had sent Rabshakeh,

461
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,739
he knew all that the Assyrians had accomplished,

462
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,679
he knew of their military accomplishments,

463
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,839
he knew of their intent to come against Judah

464
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,519
and to seek to take captive Judah.

465
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,839
God knew all of that.

466
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,039
God knew the details of the letter

467
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,439
that Rabshakeh sent for Hezekiah to be able to read,

468
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,839
and yet we find that Hezekiah,

469
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,039
in my mind's eye as I read the portion of scripture here,

470
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,519
as you read back in the book of 2 Kings

471
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,479
and you read what's taking place in the life of Hezekiah,

472
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,479
I see in my mind's eye a man

473
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,579
that is fully dependent upon the Lord,

474
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,679
he's trusting fully in the God of the universe,

475
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,799
and the creator God is his helper,

476
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,919
and he takes that letter and he spreads it out,

477
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,359
the Bible says there in verse number 14,

478
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,599
before the Lord.

479
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,639
In my mind's eye I see Hezekiah upon his face,

480
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,679
seeking the face of God.

481
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,319
He begins to pray.

482
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,319
What a great response to times of great adversity.

483
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,319
The Bible says, and Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord,

484
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,399
saying, the next few verses record for us

485
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,679
the prayer of Hezekiah, I've read verse 16,

486
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,499
but it continues beyond that.

487
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,479
Oh, how important it is that we respond

488
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,039
to times of great adversity in prayer.

489
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,679
What is it that caused Hezekiah to pray?

490
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,039
Well, he understood that God heard and answered prayer.

491
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,519
He understood that God was able.

492
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,039
He understood that God is the creator.

493
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,219
You say, pastor, you keep saying that.

494
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:35,239
I want us to get it embedded in our heads,

495
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,959
in our minds, in our hearts.

496
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,939
We find that our God, according to what Paul wrote

497
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,719
to the believers there at Ephesus

498
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,899
and seeking to encourage them,

499
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,759
he says that our God is able to exceeding abundantly

500
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,599
above all that we ask or think.

501
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,699
Wow, what a great truth.

502
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:59,399
Jeremiah is told, call unto me and I will answer thee

503
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,919
and show thee great and mighty things

504
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,259
which thou knowest not.

505
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,959
The psalmist repeatedly speaks about how he lifted up

506
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:10,999
his voice and the Lord heard me and the Lord answered me.

507
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,919
And we find the testimony of the psalmist

508
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,459
and no doubt this would have profound impact

509
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,999
in the life of Hezekiah.

510
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,779
So Hezekiah prays.

511
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:23,539
We find that his prayer is detailed for us

512
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,539
and I would say as we examine his prayer this morning

513
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,599
and how he responds in this time,

514
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,559
this midst of great adversity,

515
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,179
he says, oh Lord of hosts, God of Israel,

516
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,579
that dwellest between the cherubims,

517
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:43,399
thou art the God, even thou alone

518
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,739
of all the kingdoms of the earth,

519
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:51,179
thou hast made heaven and earth.

520
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,199
That's a great way to begin praying, isn't it?

521
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,039
What's he doing?

522
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,699
He's acknowledging who God is.

523
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:00,559
He's praying with understanding.

524
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,939
He's praying, he enters into this time of prayer

525
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,459
with really exalting the Lord.

526
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,139
And all of a sudden we begin to think

527
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:15,139
about our own prayer lives and as I seek to pray,

528
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:19,479
I seek the Lord and I enter into my time of prayer

529
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:24,479
with a time of adoration, remembering who He is,

530
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:30,719
verbalizing who He is helps me to be reminded

531
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,639
that I'm praying to the God that lives,

532
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,479
that I'm praying to my God who is holy,

533
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,259
that I'm praying to my God who is the creator.

534
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,799
Oh, it helps us because I'm not just coming,

535
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,119
listen, if we think about this truth of praying

536
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,519
and Hezekiah's circumstance that he's facing here,

537
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,579
why is it that Hezekiah didn't go to Egypt?

538
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,119
Well, Egypt couldn't help.

539
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:02,839
Why is it that Hezekiah didn't go to some other source?

540
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,079
Well, they cannot help.

541
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,639
And see, this morning, if we're not careful,

542
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,079
there are times in our own lives

543
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,499
when we will go to a wrong source,

544
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:12,359
that we will go to a wrong place

545
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,799
in order to try to find help.

546
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,079
We think that someone else or something can help us,

547
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,999
but we find that when we lift God up

548
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,599
and we understand who He is

549
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,079
and we exalt and magnify Him properly

550
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,199
and we recognize who He is,

551
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:29,979
that it causes us to trust Him because He's able.

552
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,479
It's a great army.

553
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,959
It's a great adversity, great opposition.

554
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,319
But I'm praying, Hezekiah is praying

555
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,279
to the God who is alive, who is holy, who is creator.

556
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,099
And notice what he says.

557
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:52,439
Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear.

558
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,679
Open thine eyes, O Lord, and see,

559
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,159
and hear all the words of Sennacherib

560
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,439
which hath sent to reproach the living God.

561
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,879
Believe that as we look here

562
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,719
and examine this prayer of Hezekiah,

563
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,359
that not only did he pray with understanding,

564
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,359
but I would say this, that he prayed with urgency.

565
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,759
You ever pray with urgency?

566
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,159
You have a time of great adversity.

567
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,159
You're in the midst of a storm, a trial,

568
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,879
and you have that time of great adversity.

569
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,999
And we find that Hezekiah, he's praying with understanding,

570
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,359
but he's praying with great urgency.

571
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,239
He says, Lord, incline thine ear.

572
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,399
Lord, open thine eyes.

573
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,359
Listen, it's not as if Hezekiah was thinking

574
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,119
that God didn't know or didn't see or didn't hear,

575
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,479
but he's praying with a sense of urgency.

576
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,479
He's laid this letter before the Lord

577
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:52,039
and he's before the Lord praying in the house of the Lord.

578
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,879
And the Bible says that he's praying

579
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,879
and he's saying, listen, hear all the words of Sennacherib

580
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:01,199
which hath sent to reproach the living God.

581
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,999
We find that Hezekiah understood

582
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,519
that Sennacherib's attack was not necessarily

583
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,399
upon him, Hezekiah, personally.

584
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,799
The attack was upon God, the living God.

585
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,839
Notice in verse 18, he says, of a truth, Lord,

586
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,079
the kings of Assyria have laid waste

587
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,759
all the nations and their countries.

588
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,399
I mentioned already that he prayed with understanding.

589
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,399
Hezekiah knew of the triumphs of the Assyrian army.

590
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,119
He knew that they had great power, they had a great army.

591
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,599
He was aware of that, but they weren't greater than God.

592
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:47,679
I think about back to the spies as they were sent by Moses

593
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,999
to go spy out the land and to bring back a report.

594
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,159
Those 12 spies went and 10 came back with an evil report

595
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,279
and two came back believing that God was able.

596
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,359
It was not that they did not see the same things

597
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,839
that the other 10 saw.

598
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,839
They saw the giants, they saw the walled cities,

599
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,079
they saw all of the same things.

600
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:14,639
But what those two saw that the 10 didn't see

601
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,039
was that God is greater.

602
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,959
And it was the eye of faith.

603
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:23,159
It was the understanding that God said,

604
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,599
I'm gonna bring you into this land.

605
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,959
And they just had to believe that God was able,

606
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,879
that God was greater.

607
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,879
And here, Hezekiah, as he's praying, he says,

608
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,559
listen, of a truth, Lord, what they're saying,

609
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,359
what they've written in this letter, what their messengers,

610
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,959
what Rabshakeh has said, that they've laid waste

611
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:46,439
to all the other, it's true, Lord, they have.

612
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,319
They've been successful.

613
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,239
We find that he says in verse number 19,

614
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,919
and have cast their gods into the fire.

615
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:56,759
Why?

616
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,039
For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands,

617
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,399
wood and stone.

618
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,599
Therefore, they have destroyed them.

619
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,599
Now, therefore, oh, Lord, our God,

620
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,399
save us from His hand.

621
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:14,419
Notice he prayed in simplicity.

622
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,759
There's nothing really complicated about this prayer.

623
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,319
He acknowledges who God is,

624
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,119
he acknowledges the power of God and the ability of God.

625
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,879
He prays with understanding and with urgency,

626
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,599
but he prays in simplicity.

627
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,599
He says, now, Lord, save us from His hand.

628
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,839
You believe it's a prayer of faith?

629
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,679
Do you believe that Hezekiah believed that God could?

630
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,119
I do.

631
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,399
I believe with all my heart that as Hezekiah

632
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,319
got into the house of the Lord and got on his face

633
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,959
and spread out this letter and prayed to God,

634
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:51,639
I believe that every fiber in Hezekiah's being

635
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,919
believed that God was able.

636
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,999
I believe that he prayed in faith,

637
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:59,839
believing that God was able.

638
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:11,079
to save Judah, the people of God, from Sennacherib and Rabshakeh and the armies of Assyria.

639
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,059
But I want you to notice that he prayed in simplicity and he prayed, as I mentioned,

640
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,239
he believed this, I believe that he prayed with expectation.

641
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,639
How was God going to do it?

642
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:24,179
You know, the reality is that we don't always know how God's going to do it.

643
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,439
But we expect God to work.

644
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,539
We expect God to answer.

645
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:35,979
We expect God to move and we think about this truth of having this, living a life of faith,

646
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:39,299
living a life of expectation, expectancy.

647
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,059
What is God going to do?

648
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:43,499
How is God going to work?

649
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:48,679
I was having a meeting with Fernando doing discipleship last week and we were talking

650
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,019
about the children of Israel after they crossed into the Passover, the Red Sea, and they get

651
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:01,819
into the land and they're faced immediately with bitter water.

652
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:06,539
God heals the water, the waters of Marah.

653
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:14,619
God provides manna next to the 16, I mean miraculous.

654
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:21,139
They come to Rephidim, chapter 17, and there's no water.

655
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:25,179
As you look at the text of Scripture, it seems as if there's no reference whatsoever

656
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,299
that there's anyone within the congregation of Israel that has any expectation of how

657
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,259
God would work.

658
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,739
Though God healed the waters at Marah, though God brought manna from heaven and provided

659
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,959
them with food, they come to chapter 17 of the book of Exodus and they're faced in

660
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:48,259
Rephidim with no water and it seems as if there's no expectancy whatsoever by the people

661
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:50,019
of God.

662
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:53,939
And I said this to Fernando on Monday, I said, I just, I'd like to think that there

663
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:59,299
was somebody within the congregation of Israel, I'd like to think in my own life, if I was

664
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,499
faced with that kind of situation, that I would sit back and say, listen, look at what

665
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:09,699
God did back there, look at God, how God provided this, look at the manna that we had this morning,

666
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:12,219
what is God going to do?

667
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:25,499
But so often, the problem seems to consume us and we fail to have that expectancy.

668
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:30,819
I believe that Hezekiah expected God to work.

669
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:33,659
He didn't know exactly how God was going to work.

670
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,579
What did God do in Exodus 17?

671
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,779
He told Moses to go to a rock that I'm going to show you and He gave him water from a rock.

672
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,699
That's our God.

673
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:44,699
He's able.

674
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,819
Listen, did God know that they needed water?

675
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:49,139
Sure He did.

676
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:53,619
Was it God making a mistake that led them to a place where there was no water?

677
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:54,619
No.

678
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:56,619
It was God proving them.

679
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:01,219
And it was God proving His own power and His own ability.

680
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:06,299
This morning, God's worked in your life and He's worked in my life, He's worked in our

681
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,059
church corporately.

682
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:14,619
And we find that as God has worked, that He's brought us to a place in our lives and maybe,

683
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:18,459
as I said in the beginning of the message, you're facing some great adversity and it's

684
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:22,739
overwhelming, but we look and we say, look at what God has done.

685
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:26,859
Look at how God has worked and what is God going to do now?

686
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,819
How is God going to move?

687
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:30,019
What is it that He's going to do?

688
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,179
How is He going to supply?

689
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,379
He prays with expectation.

690
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:42,619
I believe that He prays in verse number 20, if you go back there, He prayed that God alone

691
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,539
would be glorified.

692
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:49,659
This is precious to me because it's how we ought to pray.

693
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:56,019
It says here in verse number 20, now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from His hand that

694
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:07,699
all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the Lord, even Thou only.

695
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:15,499
Hezekiah is praying for deliverance, but he's praying that God alone would be glorified.

696
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:19,859
And that's important for us to understand this morning as we look at this truth that

697
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,739
the Creator God is my helper.

698
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,859
I'm so thankful that He is, but you understand that He is the one that's to be glorified.

699
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,859
He is the one that's to be exalted.

700
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:33,979
When He moves, when He works, it's our desire to see God move and work in ways that only

701
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:40,219
He can move and work so that He alone would be the one to receive the honor and the glory.

702
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,179
David prayed likewise in 1 Samuel chapter number 17 when he fights against Goliath,

703
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,219
he prays that not that he would get a name, his desire was not so that the ladies in Jerusalem

704
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,819
would say that Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands, that was not

705
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:57,059
David's goal.

706
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,419
What was David's goal?

707
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:02,339
That God would be exalted.

708
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,739
That was his prayer.

709
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:09,139
And we find here that Hezekiah, as he prays, he says that all the kingdoms of the earth

710
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:15,099
may know that Thou art the Lord, even Thou only.

711
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:22,459
The psalmist in Psalm 109 gives this truth with regard to praying that God would be glorified,

712
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:28,179
and it's such an encouragement to see how the psalmist cries out, and turn over if you

713
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:35,259
will to Psalm 109, it's a psalm that is ascribed to David, and in Psalm 109 we mention here

714
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:39,059
that our title for the message, the creator God is my helper.

715
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,859
The psalmist said in Psalm 121, I will lift up mine eyes into the hills, from whence cometh

716
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:43,859
my help.

717
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:47,019
From the Lord which made heaven and earth.

718
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:53,419
Notice in Psalm 109, notice what the Bible says, help me, in verse 26, Psalm 109 verse

719
00:35:53,419 --> 00:36:01,899
26, help me O Lord my God, O save me according to Thy mercy.

720
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:06,499
You ever pray a prayer like that?

721
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:15,499
And notice what he says in verse 27, that they may know that this is Thy hand, that

722
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:20,059
Thou Lord has done it.

723
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:28,419
He prays for God to help him, but he prays that it would be known that it was the hand

724
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:34,219
of God, that it was God that did it.

725
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,779
When it's known that God does it, it is God that receives the glory for it.

726
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:44,059
That ought to be our desire.

727
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:51,539
We find that Hezekiah responded in the midst of great adversity in the way in which he

728
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:57,199
did because he recognized in the midst of great adversity who God is.

729
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,179
He recognized that the creator God was his helper.

730
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,159
This morning the creator God is our helper.

731
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:09,799
And I'm not sure of the adversity that you're facing in your life, I'm not sure of all the

732
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:14,839
trials and the troubles and the difficulties that we face, but we can rejoice in knowing

733
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,679
that our God is the creator and we study the truth of God's word and we see His greatness,

734
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,259
but then we apply it to us as individuals and say, and He is my helper.

735
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:31,559
The one who said and it was so, He's my helper.

736
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,999
We won't take the time to read the entirety of Isaiah 37, but back in Isaiah 37, I want

737
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:42,399
you to read, this afternoon I would encourage you to read the entirety of chapters 36 and

738
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,399
37.

739
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:48,799
There's such great truth here in how God makes this promise in response to the prayer of

740
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,939
Hezekiah.

741
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:56,119
But notice for sake of time, skip down to verse 33, if you will, of Isaiah 37 and verse

742
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,319
33, and notice what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria.

743
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:04,559
It says this in verse number 33,

744
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,919
Therefore, thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into

745
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:18,319
the city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against

746
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,719
it.

747
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,199
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return.

748
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:27,959
He shall not come into the city, saith the Lord.

749
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:36,119
Then notice verse 35, for I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for

750
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,839
my servant David's sake.

751
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,679
Isn't that a wonderful promise outlined in verses 33, 34, and 35?

752
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,419
I mean, notice what God says.

753
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:47,839
He says that he shall not come into the city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before

754
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,719
it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

755
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,839
That's pretty specific, isn't it?

756
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:58,439
I mean, it's extremely specific as to the promise that God is giving, and he says this,

757
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:01,039
I will defend this city.

758
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,319
I understand this morning that we're not speaking in the same terms of Judah or Israel, that

759
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:12,239
as a church, that we understand that the church is not spiritual Israel, and we understand

760
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,719
those things biblically and processing and properly interpreting the scripture, but I

761
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,479
want you to understand that God is for us.

762
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:29,319
He sang this morning two wonderful songs about marching on, onward, forward, and being in

763
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,919
the Lord's army, and what a blessing to think about the work of God and the work that he's

764
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:39,759
called us to, and the fact that he said that if God be for us, who can be against us?

765
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,999
We are more than conquerors through him.

766
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:48,399
We understand that Paul proclaims greatly after dealing with the resurrection chapter

767
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:56,599
in 1 Corinthians 15 that we are victorious, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

768
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,399
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

769
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:06,519
I'm often reminded of the wonderful promise in Matthew 16 when Jesus Christ Himself said,

770
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:13,079
I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

771
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,919
I mentioned to you when I was in Israel just a couple of months ago when Holly and I were

772
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:24,639
there, we had the opportunity to go to Caesarea Philippi, where Jesus made that proclamation.

773
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:31,919
And I got to see exactly where it was, why it was that Jesus would have taken His disciples

774
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,599
to that particular location.

775
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,579
It was a challenging journey by bus, they had to walk.

776
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:47,159
But the backdrop of that evil, wicked place of Caesarea Philippi and all of the idolatry

777
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:54,919
that took place there, literally, as many people in the land believe it was as close

778
00:40:54,919 --> 00:41:02,519
to hell as you could possibly get, literally the gates of hell, that Jesus in that place

779
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:12,799
said I will build my church, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

780
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:17,279
The promise is made in Isaiah 37 verses 33-35.

781
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:22,679
I want you to see that it's fulfilled in verses 36-38.

782
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:31,979
The Bible says this, then, verse 36, the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp

783
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:36,599
of the Assyrians a hundred and four score and five thousand.

784
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,439
When they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

785
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,599
It's a hundred and eighty-five thousand people.

786
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,359
Back in chapter 36, you don't need to turn and look at the whole thing, but one of the

787
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:59,519
things that Rabshakeh said in verse number 8 was, I will give thee two thousand horses

788
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,399
if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

789
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:08,399
There's a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the army.

790
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:12,159
He said, we'll give you two thousand if you have enough to put riders on them.

791
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,799
A hundred and eighty-five thousand killed in one night because of the angel of the Lord.

792
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:24,959
Verse 37, so Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, which is what God said would happen.

793
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,999
Verse 34, by the way that he came, by the same shall he return, shall not come into

794
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,159
the city, saith the Lord.

795
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:36,039
Verse 37, so Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.

796
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,719
He came to pass as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch, his god, that Adrammelech

797
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,299
and Sherezer, his son, smote him with the sword and they escaped in the land of Armenia

798
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:50,039
and Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.

799
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:59,439
It's a great truth of the Old Testament with regard to Hezekiah trusting in the Lord, trusting

800
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:05,319
that the creator God is his helper.

801
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,219
And I'm thankful for the testimony of Hezekiah.

802
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:13,339
You can read of other kings of Israel and Judah who turned to other places for help

803
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:20,979
in times of adversity, that thought they could hire some soldiers and they could do some

804
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,979
different things and they could receive help this way.

805
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:33,939
But you find that Hezekiah, he trusted in the Lord, understanding who God is and what

806
00:43:33,939 --> 00:43:36,499
God is capable of doing.

807
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:41,939
He said, though the odds seem to be in favor for the enemy, though the great army is here,

808
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:47,419
though they've said all of these things, I'm going to trust God and I'm going to expect

809
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:54,139
that God's going to work and I'm going to pray that through it, God alone gets the glory.

810
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:58,899
I think about our theme this year, great is the Lord.

811
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:05,099
We see in Psalm 48, verse 1 and 2, the verses that are familiar to us, the verses that we

812
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:12,179
sing for our song, our theme song for this year, but we must remember that the Psalm

813
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:19,139
ends, it begins with the great declaration of how great God is, but it ends by telling

814
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:26,899
us that this God is our God forever and ever.

815
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:32,179
He will be our guide even unto death.

816
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:38,379
I'm thankful that Hezekiah recognized the greatness of God.

817
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:44,419
In the midst of great adversity, he said, my God's greater.

818
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:52,259
He responded in a proper way in that time of great adversity.

819
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:58,979
Again, I don't know the great adversity in your life.

820
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,459
Each of us face adversity.

821
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:06,779
We have difficulties and challenges.

822
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:11,779
I said to someone recently, actually I think it was Fernando, the same conversation with

823
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:17,139
regard to the children of Israel, the human tendency is that the current trial is the

824
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,619
worst we've ever endured.

825
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:25,379
It's just kind of the way it works.

826
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:30,179
The current adversity is the worst that we've ever endured.

827
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:36,159
We know that that's not true, but it feels that way.

828
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:43,139
But oh, that God would help us to have that eye of faith and to trust Him, to see that

829
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:47,259
the Creator God is my helper.

830
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:52,139
He said, let there be light, and there was light.

831
00:45:52,139 --> 00:46:03,059
If He could speak everything into existence, if He upholds it all by His own power, surely

832
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:09,259
the attack of Sennacherib and Rabshakeh is nothing for God.

833
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:11,939
That's what Hezekiah understood.

834
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:15,459
In the midst of your great adversity, in the midst of my great adversity, in the midst

835
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:22,019
of our great adversity, it's nothing for our great God.

836
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,779
I hope this morning that when we study a passage of Scripture like this, that our faith would

837
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:32,899
be increased, and we would recognize as we leave here this morning that the Creator God

838
00:46:32,899 --> 00:46:37,859
is my helper, and we make it very personal.

839
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:44,719
I'm so thankful that He's the Creator, so thankful that He gave us the record of creation,

840
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,119
but how does it impact me?

841
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,919
How does it impact you in everyday living?

842
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:58,279
The way it impacts us is that He's my helper, and I'm going to rely upon Him.

843
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:06,319
See vain is the help of men, but God is our helper, and He's the Creator.

844
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,319
Let's pray.

845
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:08,319
Father, we love You.

846
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,599
Oh, we thank You for loving us.

847
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:21,679
Thank You this morning for the record of Hezekiah, the way in which He trusted You, the record

848
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,279
of great adversity as given.

849
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:30,039
It was real.

850
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:36,839
Thankful for what Hezekiah recognized in the midst of that great adversity.

851
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:43,119
He recognized that You're the Creator God, and that You are His helper.

852
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,039
Therefore He responded the way that He did.

853
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,619
God, You gave victory.

854
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,039
We read it.

855
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,919
We understand it to be so.

856
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:57,999
But Lord, I pray that the truth of this passage of Scripture and the truth of this message

857
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:03,239
this morning would have a profound impact in each of our lives.

858
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:11,959
No doubt in a crowd of any number, there are people that are dealing with adversity,

859
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:19,359
great adversity, people that are facing great challenges and difficulties and adversities.

860
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:28,279
Lord, I pray that as Your children, that we'd recognize Your greatness, that we'd respond

861
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:29,739
accordingly.

862
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,479
Help us to trust You, Lord.

863
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:37,879
Help us to have that faith that Hezekiah had.

864
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:41,479
I pray, Lord, that if there's one present, one that's tuned in via live stream, they've

865
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:45,199
never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

866
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,959
They do not have 100% certainty if they were to die today that heaven is their home.

867
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:56,479
God, I pray that today they would trust the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

868
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:03,719
That understand that they cannot earn heaven, they cannot get there on their own.

869
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:04,719
God loves them.

870
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:12,359
God, You love them so much that You sent Your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die for them.

871
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:19,119
He was buried and He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave, alive forevermore, Savior

872
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,159
of the world.

873
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:27,359
And You offer that free gift of eternal life to whosoever shall call upon the name of the

874
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,359
Lord.

875
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:32,759
Lord, I pray this morning that You'd meet each need of each individual that's here this

876
00:49:32,759 --> 00:49:33,759
morning.

877
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:36,079
Lord, help us.

878
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,759
We pray that You'd be glorified as You do.

879
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:45,319
Pray that You'd move and work now in these moments, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

880
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,319
Would You stand with me?

881
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

882
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,959
This is our custom at the end of each of our services.

883
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:53,199
We have a time of invitation.

884
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,119
Simply, we give you opportunity to respond to how the Holy Spirit of God may have used

885
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,439
His Word this morning in your life.

886
00:49:58,439 --> 00:50:00,859
life.

887
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:04,119
So in these moments of invitation, Jared will play quietly on the piano.

888
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,119
The altar is open.

889
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,799
Maybe you want to make your seat an altar, come to this old-fashioned altar.

890
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:12,519
But as God has spoken to your heart, would you respond?

891
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:14,199
As Jared plays, the altar is open.
