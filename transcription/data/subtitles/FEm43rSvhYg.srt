1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
team this morning in your Bible, and to be looking the next few weeks at some messages

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,380
here from the life of Elijah. The Lord, I believe, as you look at his word, as we have

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,039
our theme for this year, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. We understand that

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:22,639
the Lord has graciously revealed his greatness to us through his word. And we have examined

5
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:29,280
several portions of scripture this year in our quest to discover the greatness of God.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,080
And I'm so thankful that God has given us a Bible, and not only has he told us that

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,840
he's great, but he's demonstrated his greatness for us. And we have the privilege of being

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
able to study a variety of portions of scripture and understanding, discovering the greatness

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
of God. As we move into the latter part of the year, we'll shift gears slightly and deal

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,279
with now that we've discovered God's greatness, it is important that we then declare God's

11
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:02,799
greatness, for we have a great God and he is to be declared. We mentioned this as we

12
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:10,239
started the year, that creation reveals God's greatness. And we said that through creation,

13
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:16,199
we see the power of God, we see the wisdom of God on display, and we find that God's

14
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:21,879
greatness is demonstrated, is revealed to us through creation. We spent a number of

15
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,519
weeks dealing with various aspects of creation, and what God's word tells us about creation.

16
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:34,120
And I'm so thankful that the creator God is also my helper and my deliverer, and he is

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,599
my redeemer. Obviously, as we get into the truth of redemption, begin to think about

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:46,080
the truth that the deliverance of God reveals his greatness. Again, you see his great power,

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,680
you see the fact that he's our great helper. We mentioned that inspiration reveals God's

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,559
greatness. We dealt with the inspiration of God's word. I'm so thankful that this is

21
00:01:55,559 --> 00:02:02,300
not man's word about God, that this is the word of God. And the Bible says that all scripture

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:09,080
is given by inspiration of God, and what a joy and a blessing. Not only did we say that

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,460
inspiration reveals God's greatness, but preservation reveals God's greatness. It's a wonderful

24
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,440
thing that he inspired the originals, but we don't have the originals, but he promised

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,240
to preserve his word. And what a blessing to have the truth of preservation and to understand

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,380
this morning that we can have confidence in the book that we hold in our hands, knowing

27
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,839
that God has promised to preserve his word. And by the way, God cannot lie. He always

28
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:46,880
does what he says he will do, and he obviously used people. The Bible tells us that he exalts

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,839
his word above his very name, and he is obviously in his wisdom and in his grace and mercy,

30
00:02:54,839 --> 00:03:01,199
he provided for us his word so that we could know him. And obviously we are without excuse

31
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,960
because he has given us his word. I mentioned this for a couple of weeks, that his love

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,399
demonstrates, reveals to us his greatness. We read about his great love, and I'm so thankful.

33
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:21,320
The songwriter said, amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God, didst die for me?

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:28,039
Amazing love, and God's love reveals to us just how great he is. The last couple of weeks

35
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,160
we've dealt with the truth of God's mercy, and God's mercy revealing his greatness. For

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,919
the next couple of messages, we'd like to examine how God's care for us reveals his

37
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,759
greatness. And we will consider some of the events from the life of Elijah, because I

38
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:53,119
believe that it so obviously reveals how God cares for his people. And God's care for us,

39
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:58,960
you think about the billions of people that are upon the face of the earth today, and

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,039
nearing eight billion people in population, and it is hard for us to wrap our mind around

41
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,440
that number. There are believers all around the globe. There are people all around the

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,720
globe that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal savior, and we can rejoice

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,480
in that. We've had opportunity to meet believers, brothers and sisters in Christ from all sorts

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,320
of places. As you travel abroad, you have the opportunity, maybe not to be able to speak

45
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,399
with someone in the language that they speak, but you still have that bond in Christ, and

46
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,160
there's just something about that, and it's so precious, and it's so wonderful. And the

47
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,920
amazing thing about our great God is that he cares about you the same way he cares about

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,880
the someone on the other side of the globe, and every other person in between, all of

49
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,679
his children, he cares for us. And what a blessing to understand God's care, and I believe

50
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:06,880
that God's care for his children reveals just how great he is. As we look at the life of

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,600
Elijah, it's interesting, Elijah just comes on the pages of scripture, seemingly out of

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,640
obscurity. The Bible just declares in verse number one of 1 Kings 17, and Elijah, the

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,000
Tishbite. We don't have any reference of Elijah prior to this, obviously. From this

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,519
point forward, for a number of chapters, we'll read several things about the life and ministry

55
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,679
of Elijah, but from obscurity, it seems as if Elijah just comes upon the pages of scripture

56
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:42,200
in this particular time of history, in Israel's history, when Israel is far from God, when

57
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,640
Israel is just, Ahab is a wicked king, and we find that Elijah comes on the scene, and

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,040
notice the Bible says, and Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said

59
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:03,119
unto Ahab, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew

60
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:11,640
nor rain these years, but according to my word. That's a bold declaration. The boldness

61
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,720
of Elijah, it will not be the focus of our message this morning, but we know that Elijah

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,320
knew some things, he understood some things about God. He understood that God lives, that

63
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,079
God is a living God. He says this, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, notice what he

64
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:37,359
says, before whom I stand. When we stand and serve the Lord God Almighty, when we're going

65
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:43,799
in His power and in His might, we can stand before even the most wicked of kings, as

66
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:50,679
you see Ahab here, and we can deliver what thus saith the Lord. And we find that it was

67
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:57,779
God who was giving this instruction and this command to Elijah, and this particular message

68
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:05,200
of judgment that is delivered by Elijah to King Ahab. Obviously, Elijah, in obedience

69
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,480
to the Lord, delivering this message of divine judgment, we find that the Bible then continues

70
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,320
in verse number 2 and says, and the word of the Lord came unto him, Elijah, saying, notice

71
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,559
what the Bible says in verse 3, down through verse number 7, get thee hence and turn thee

72
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:30,279
eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be that

73
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,839
thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So

74
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,799
he went and did according unto the word of the Lord, for he went and dwelt by the brook

75
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,619
Cherith, that is before Jordan. The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning

76
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:50,720
and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook. The Bible tells us in

77
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,339
verse number 7, and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up, because there

78
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,540
had been no rain in the land. As we look at this portion of scripture this morning and

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,579
we consider God's care for his servant Elijah, and obviously God's care for us, I've titled

80
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:12,019
the message based on the portion of scripture where God says this in verse number 3, hide

81
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:17,700
thyself by the brook Cherith. Hide thyself by the brook Cherith. I would say this this

82
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,220
morning, that God's care, number 1 if you're taking notes, God's care is evidenced through

83
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:29,339
guidance. God's care is evidenced through guidance. Because God cares about his people,

84
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:34,460
he provides his people with guidance, with direction. And I think about the truth here

85
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,380
in the life of Elijah, as Elijah is standing there before King Ahab, king of Israel, this

86
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,900
wicked man, the Bible describes Ahab in verse number 33 of chapter number 16 this way, and

87
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,619
Ahab made a grove, and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the

88
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:58,460
kings of Israel that were before him. And that's not really something to be proud about,

89
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,500
he is a wicked man, an ungodly man, and we find that Elijah is going to stand in his

90
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,900
presence in obedience to the Lord God Almighty, the Lord God of Israel that liveth, and he's

91
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:15,419
going to stand there and deliver a message of divine judgment. That message of divine

92
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,099
judgment, we understand that the impact of that judgment would be severe, and it would

93
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:28,099
be far-reaching. You find that Elijah would suffer from the consequences of this drought

94
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,140
that is announced in verse number 1 that says there shall not be dune or rain these years,

95
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:42,539
but according to my word. A drought is a very serious form of judgment. We find that the

96
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:50,179
impacts are quite severe and far-reaching. There are times in which we have in our lives

97
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,700
experienced maybe some windows where there's a couple of weeks without rain, and we begin

98
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,979
to see the impact on that even so quickly.

99
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,199
but can you imagine for years with no rain?

100
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,619
Years.

101
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,299
The impact would be severe,

102
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,979
the impact would be far-reaching.

103
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,939
But I find in the text of scripture,

104
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,939
as I mentioned that God's care is evidenced through guidance

105
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:21,819
that after Elijah delivers this message of divine judgment,

106
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,179
that the Lord came unto him and spoke to him,

107
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,819
according to verse number two,

108
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:30,739
and gave him guidance, provided him with direction.

109
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,779
The Bible says, get thee hence in verse number three,

110
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,959
and turn thee eastward,

111
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,339
and hide thyself by the brook Cherith

112
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,659
that is before Jordan.

113
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,499
Now it's interesting to me that as I look at the guidance

114
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,759
that God so graciously provides in verse number three,

115
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,819
revealing to us his great care for his servant,

116
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,939
that this guidance, this direction that is provided,

117
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,799
is clear and it's direct.

118
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,339
God was very clear in how he had given this instruction,

119
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,359
this guidance to his servant Elijah.

120
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,099
He didn't just say, hey, go eastward.

121
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,599
How far eastward?

122
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,439
To what place?

123
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,399
When have I arrived to the place where I'm to be?

124
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
No, we find that God very specifically,

125
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,239
he says, turn thee eastward and hide thyself

126
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,639
by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan.

127
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,619
He gave him a specific location,

128
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,559
he provided him with the exact guidance

129
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,819
that he would need.

130
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,899
This morning, if we'd be honest,

131
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,859
we each need guidance in our lives.

132
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:39,459
We need God's divine direction.

133
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,619
We need his leadership in our lives.

134
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,499
I'm thankful as you look at the Old Testament,

135
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,459
you begin to study the Old Testament

136
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,859
and the children of Israel during the time

137
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:51,739
in which they left Egypt in the wilderness wanderings,

138
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:55,219
you find that God graciously and supernaturally

139
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,459
led his people through some amazing means

140
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,559
in which he gave them guidance and clear direction.

141
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,619
It was a pillar of cloud by day

142
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:06,459
and a pillar of fire by night.

143
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,779
And it was so obvious.

144
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,719
And as the pillar of cloud would move

145
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,259
and the pillar of fire would move,

146
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,919
they would follow the leadership.

147
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,619
And even though they were following the leadership

148
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:18,299
of God Almighty, you would find that there were times,

149
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,979
many times in fact, that the children of Israel

150
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,899
would complain about the way

151
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,779
and what they discovered or found,

152
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,619
the hardships that they encountered.

153
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,659
And I will say this, that there are times

154
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:32,419
in which God is guiding us and leading us

155
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,059
and he may lead us directly into a time of difficulty.

156
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,399
It was God who told the disciples to get into the ship

157
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,859
and to go to the other side.

158
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:46,139
And as they obeyed the Lord, there was a great storm.

159
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,439
They were following the direction of God.

160
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,739
But in so doing, they encountered a storm.

161
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,659
And what was it that God was going to do?

162
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,199
He was going to reveal more of his attributes,

163
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,739
more of his power to his people.

164
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,419
And he was gonna deliver them through that.

165
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,059
And we find that God provides guidance.

166
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,619
And here for the servant Elijah,

167
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,739
God comes and speaks to him and gives him guidance.

168
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,459
I'm thankful this morning, unlike Elijah,

169
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,499
this morning we have the whole Bible.

170
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,019
We have the Holy Spirit of God who dwells within us.

171
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,579
If you've been saved this morning,

172
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,539
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

173
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:26,179
as your personal savior, the Bible tells us

174
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,019
that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of God,

175
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,699
that our bodies, that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost

176
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:35,219
which is in us, which we have of God.

177
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:38,299
We understand that God provides us with guidance

178
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,979
and direction through his word and through his spirit.

179
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,239
And the direction is clear.

180
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,979
The guidance that God provides to Elijah is clear

181
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:49,939
and it is direct.

182
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:53,819
It is not difficult for Elijah to be able to understand

183
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,439
what it is that God is giving him the guidance

184
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,739
and it's not complicated.

185
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,819
Notice that with the guidance came a promise.

186
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,659
That's what the Bible says in verse number four

187
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,179
of 1 Kings 17.

188
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,459
The Bible says, and it shall be

189
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,239
that thou shalt drink of the brook.

190
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,219
And then notice this promise.

191
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:22,219
And I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

192
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:29,939
Do you think about the Lord God Almighty

193
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:35,099
providing guidance to his servant Elijah,

194
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:39,219
revealing to us his great care for his servant,

195
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:43,099
but we find also that he gave commandment to the ravens.

196
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,919
By the way, the ravens are God's creation.

197
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,219
It's interesting to me as you study through the scriptures,

198
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,579
you'll find that outside of humans,

199
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,819
God's creation always obey him.

200
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:02,219
I'm pretty confident that Jonah, the disobedient prophet

201
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:05,679
was thankful that that great fish was obedient to God.

202
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,519
Right.

203
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,839
And then the disobedient prophet

204
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,839
became an obedient prophet after his encounter

205
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,299
and after all that had taken place.

206
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:21,679
But we find here, notice he says,

207
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,759
God tells Elijah that there at this place Cherith,

208
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,739
the brook that God has given him the direction,

209
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,639
the guidance to go to this place.

210
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,739
He says, you'll drink of the water there,

211
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:36,199
but he says, I've commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

212
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,119
Now, the Bible tells us in Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,

213
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,639
that we're to trust in the Lord with all our hearts,

214
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,299
we're to lean not on our own understanding.

215
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,759
If you know anything about ravens,

216
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,559
and I'm thinking, I'm assuming that Elijah

217
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,719
knew some things about ravens,

218
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:56,719
that maybe there'd be reason to wonder how are the ravens,

219
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,819
like, how is this going to work?

220
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,759
We don't see anywhere in the passage of Scripture

221
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,619
that Elijah doubts or questions or even hesitates

222
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,739
at the command and the promise that are revealed to him.

223
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:13,879
And as we look at the passage of Scripture

224
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,739
and we see what's taking place

225
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,779
and we see God's care evidenced through guidance

226
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,739
this morning for his servant, for Elijah,

227
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,439
I'm so thankful, as I've mentioned already,

228
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:27,499
that today God continues to provide guidance

229
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:28,739
for his children.

230
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,499
Why does he guide us?

231
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,379
Why is it that he'd be concerned in your life,

232
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,339
in my life, in providing us with guidance?

233
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,299
Why would the God of the universe,

234
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,799
when you and when I are in a position in our lives

235
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,099
and we enter into the presence of God

236
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,139
and we're praying, we're saying,

237
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,819
God, I need your guidance, I need your direction,

238
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,499
God, would you please provide me with leadership?

239
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,379
Why does he, why?

240
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,699
Because he loves us and he cares about us.

241
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,259
I think about my children

242
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,179
and many of you have children this morning

243
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,339
and at some point you were a child.

244
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,259
As a child, you might ask your parents for some guidance.

245
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:15,939
You might seek the counsel of your parents

246
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,959
with regard to decisions that have to be made

247
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,699
and what have you and I'm always thankful,

248
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,979
it's a blessing to me when my children

249
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,739
will contact me for guidance.

250
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,779
You know, what's interesting now

251
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,699
is a parent of a married child

252
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,399
is the encouragement that comes

253
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,699
when a married child will contact you for guidance

254
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,699
because there's still a level of understanding,

255
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,859
of respect and the wisdom,

256
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,939
not that I'm saying that I'm some wise individual

257
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,379
but you understand what I'm saying.

258
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,419
And this morning, when you begin to think about

259
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,499
a child coming and seeking the guidance of a parent,

260
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:55,059
we understand that but we,

261
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,339
why do we give guidance to our children?

262
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,819
Why is it, listen, there are times in which

263
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,779
my children will say something like this

264
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,179
and it always bothers me when they say this.

265
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,019
They'll say, daddy, I know that you're busy

266
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,899
but and I say, no, no, no, no, I am not,

267
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,539
I don't ever want you to think I'm too busy for you.

268
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,699
I want them to come and to ask and why?

269
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:17,819
Because I care about them, I love them.

270
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,219
I wanna provide them with guidance

271
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,899
and our heavenly father who knows everything,

272
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,059
who knows the end from the beginning,

273
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,539
who is alpha and omega,

274
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,539
though you do not know what's on the morrow, he does

275
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,859
and he provides us with guidance.

276
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,820
He provides us with direction because he loves us.

277
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,579
I want you to think about a few verses of scripture

278
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,419
in the book of Psalms.

279
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,179
If you turn to Psalm chapter five,

280
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,739
look at just a few verses here in the book of Psalms

281
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,419
this morning, Psalm chapter number five.

282
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,619
Speaking of the truth of the guidance,

283
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,139
the leadership of God Almighty,

284
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,779
notice the prayer of the psalmist in Psalm five,

285
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,959
a psalm that is ascribed to David in verse number eight.

286
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,339
Notice what he says,

287
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,519
lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness

288
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,059
because of mine enemies.

289
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,059
Notice what he says, make thy way straight before my face.

290
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:24,219
Make thy way straight before my face.

291
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:28,219
I'm mindful of what the psalmist will say in Psalm 27

292
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,260
in verse number 11 where the Bible says,

293
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,579
teach me thy way, O Lord,

294
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:36,579
and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.

295
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,339
How often in my life I pray

296
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,979
that God would make the path plain

297
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,739
and that God would make the path straight,

298
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:49,659
that God would give clear guidance and direction

299
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,320
as I seek his face,

300
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,940
and I believe that God is delighted

301
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,380
when we as his children seek his face for guidance.

302
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,579
Notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 27.

303
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:05,579
In Psalm 73, in verse number 24,

304
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,659
a psalm that is described to Asaph,

305
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,419
getting to the end of the psalm,

306
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,019
and it's so precious and powerful to see

307
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:21,379
the great contrast as to how he starts the psalm

308
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,099
and how he ends the psalm.

309
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,459
But notice in verse number 23,

310
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:28,739
the Bible says, nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

311
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,279
Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

312
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,039
Can you get the imagery here?

313
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,359
Can you see as a parent would hold their hand

314
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,319
of their child, and God is our heavenly Father,

315
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,599
and we as his children, and it says this,

316
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,599
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,

317
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,879
and afterward, receive me to glory.

318
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,839
I hope that this morning, each of us would follow

319
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,939
the leadership and guidance of God

320
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,039
all the days of our lives,

321
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,539
and then he would receive us to glory,

322
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:04,699
that when we take that final breath here upon this earth,

323
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,779
that we enter into his very presence

324
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,019
and understanding that we've been guided

325
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,619
with God's counsel.

326
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,699
Where do we find God's counsel?

327
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,579
His word, his word.

328
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,219
Notice what the Bible says in Psalm 119,

329
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:20,579
a verse of scripture that is quite familiar to us

330
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,579
in Psalm 119, as we begin to consider the guidance

331
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,679
and how God's care is evidenced for his people

332
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,439
through his guidance, and I'm so thankful

333
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:35,679
that God provided guidance to Elijah,

334
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,399
but this morning, I must rest and understand

335
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,359
that he continues to provide guidance for me

336
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,639
and for you this morning in our lives.

337
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,039
Psalm 109 and verse 105, the Bible says,

338
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,479
thy word is a lamp unto my feet

339
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,599
and a light unto my path.

340
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,319
I'm thankful for the guidance that God gives

341
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,419
through his word, his counsel, his wisdom

342
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,439
that is contained therein.

343
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:05,159
I've said this often as I've counseled with individuals.

344
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,679
I've said this often as I've preached from God's word

345
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,439
that God will never lead you contrary to his word.

346
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,039
God will not lead you contrary to his word.

347
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,139
God will never lead you to do something

348
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:21,279
that contradicts a principle that he has placed

349
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,519
within this book.

350
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,479
God's guidance and God's leadership in your life

351
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:30,079
will always be consistent with what God says in his word.

352
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,239
Well, you don't understand, Pastor,

353
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,719
God's just guiding me to do this.

354
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,679
No, he's not, and I can say that

355
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,719
because of the authority of God's word.

356
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,399
Now, I understand that there are places

357
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,039
in which you can look to and you say,

358
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,839
well, God's guiding me to move to this place

359
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,799
or go to this place.

360
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,799
You're not gonna find a specific verse of scripture

361
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,719
that's gonna say, you know, so and so,

362
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,839
you should live in this place or do this thing,

363
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,279
but you understand that as we look to God's word

364
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,139
that God provides us with the guidance that we need.

365
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:02,659
We follow his leadership.

366
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,319
God's care for Elijah.

367
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,119
God's care for us this morning

368
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,579
is evidenced through his guidance.

369
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,959
Turn back to 1 Kings 17, if you will.

370
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,639
I would say not only is God's care evidenced

371
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,799
through guidance, but God's care is evidenced

372
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,119
through sustenance, through sustenance.

373
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,839
The obedience of Elijah is noted in verse number five

374
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,959
of our text of scripture, where the Bible simply says this,

375
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:33,959
so he, speaking of Elijah, went and did according

376
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,059
unto the word of the Lord.

377
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,259
Isn't that a wonderful truth, as God would record for us

378
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,059
the obedience of Elijah?

379
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,379
Listen, obedience is absolutely imperative.

380
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:48,419
As God would provide us with guidance and direction

381
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,579
in our lives, that we would submit to his leadership,

382
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,339
that we would obey the direction that he's given

383
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,379
to us in our lives.

384
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:58,419
Listen, if Elijah decided, well, Lord,

385
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:59,939
I know you tell me to go to the brook Cherith

386
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,119
and I know you tell me to go over there,

387
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,219
but I think I know better, I think I understand

388
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,539
the terrain and the situation better,

389
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,139
so I'm gonna go over to this place,

390
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:12,299
because in my mind, it's going to be better for me there.

391
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:21,199
No ravens are gonna show up there.

392
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,039
Why?

393
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,699
Because God said specifically at the end

394
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:26,339
of verse number four, and I have commanded the ravens

395
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,139
to feed thee there, there.

396
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,299
Every word is important.

397
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,899
He didn't just say, and I have commanded the ravens

398
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:36,739
to feed thee.

399
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:42,779
I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

400
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:43,819
Where's there?

401
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,619
The brook Cherith.

402
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,219
A specific location.

403
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,659
And the Bible tells us that Elijah is immediately obedient

404
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,099
to the word of the Lord, so he went and did a courting

405
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,739
unto the word of the Lord, and thank God

406
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:03,619
for the obedience of Elijah, for we find that

407
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:07,139
through his obedience that he sustained this,

408
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,299
through this period of time and the sustenances there,

409
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,859
we find that he receives a personal delivery

410
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:15,819
of both bread and flesh in the morning,

411
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:19,499
and again in the evening by the ravens.

412
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:21,339
This is absolutely amazing.

413
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,139
You say, I'm familiar with the portion of scripture.

414
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,499
I hope that you take a fresh approach

415
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,179
to God's word this morning.

416
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,979
I believe that if we took a servant

417
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,099
when we came in this morning and said what happened

418
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,859
at the brook Cherith, most of us, if not all of us,

419
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:37,619
would have said that Elijah went there and he drank

420
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,539
of the brook and the ravens brought him food.

421
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,239
We're aware of it, but I want you to see how God

422
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:46,699
is caring for his servant and how he's using the ravens

423
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,739
to bring each morning, notice what the Bible says

424
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:53,019
at the end of verse number five, for he went and dwelt

425
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,019
by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan,

426
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,539
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning

427
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:02,139
and bread and flesh in the evening,

428
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:05,179
and he drank of the brook.

429
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,339
Can you imagine?

430
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,579
In my mind's eye, I see Elijah.

431
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,939
I mean, he goes to the place, Tim, where God told him

432
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:15,459
to go and he gets there, and on that first morning,

433
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,299
guess what?

434
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,439
Here come the ravens.

435
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:19,459
Look at this.

436
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,499
The ravens are, just like God said, the ravens are coming,

437
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,679
and sure enough, they bring, no, ravens are scavengers.

438
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:32,539
Ravens like to steal your lunch, not bring you lunch.

439
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,459
You understand what I'm saying?

440
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,019
Do you, I mean, am I telling the truth?

441
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:43,079
Ravens don't wanna bring you lunch, but God commanded them.

442
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,739
God commanded them, and God's creation obeys him,

443
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:54,739
and those ravens came there to the brook Cherith,

444
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:00,099
and they brought Elijah a meal, bread and flesh,

445
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,899
and the Bible says that he drank of the brook

446
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,779
in verse number six.

447
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:10,099
I don't know how long Elijah was at the brook Cherith.

448
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,779
I'm not sure of the length of time that he was there,

449
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,059
but for however long he was there,

450
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,839
each morning and each evening,

451
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:22,499
there was a personal delivery for Elijah

452
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,579
of bread and of flesh.

453
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,879
Isn't that amazing to you?

454
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,619
Does that not reveal to you God's care?

455
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,579
God knows what we have need of.

456
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:38,339
God created us, and the creator God knows

457
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,339
what we have need of, and we find that as God

458
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,859
would make this command, he'd make this promise

459
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,999
to Elijah, and he would command the ravens to feed him,

460
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,379
that Elijah sat in that place, and Elijah,

461
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:56,379
he experienced the blessing of God, the provision of God.

462
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,619
God's care was evidenced for Elijah

463
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:03,419
through this sustenance, this food that was provided.

464
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,639
I would say to you this morning that God is able

465
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:09,779
to sustain his children no matter the circumstances.

466
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:14,099
God is able, and though the circumstances there

467
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,139
in Cherith were, and in Israel, broadly speaking,

468
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:21,279
the circumstances were going to continue to deteriorate.

469
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,119
Why?

470
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,539
Because there's no rain.

471
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,299
There's no dew.

472
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,819
The judgment, the divine judgment of God is upon the nation

473
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,739
because of their wickedness, because of their idolatry,

474
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,539
because of their sin, and God is withholding

475
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,299
the rain from them, and we find that here is Elijah

476
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,139
over by this brook Cherith, and he's eating,

477
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,559
and he's drinking.

478
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,339
Because God cares about him,

479
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,859
and God's care is evidenced in his life.

480
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,899
You say, but pastor, the brook dries up.

481
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,739
I know.

482
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,739
And I would submit to you this morning

483
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,579
that God knew about that as well,

484
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:04,659
and God had a plan.

485
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:08,739
Listen, it did not surprise God when the brook dried up.

486
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:11,899
God knew that the brook would dry up.

487
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:12,739
Why?

488
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,799
Because there was no rain.

489
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,459
God knew, and God had a plan.

490
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,639
We'll look at the next message as God's care continues

491
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:25,479
to be evidenced in the life of Elijah and how God works,

492
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,679
but as we begin to think about God's guidance

493
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,999
and God's sustenance in the life of Elijah

494
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:35,599
and how it reveals to us and reminds us of the fact

495
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,039
that God cares about his servants,

496
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,239
I want you this morning to recognize

497
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:43,239
that God cares about you as an individual.

498
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,319
He cares about you.

499
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,359
I've heard people say, no one cares about me.

500
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,919
You ever heard anyone say that?

501
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,079
I've heard people say, no one loves me.

502
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,919
You ever heard somebody say that?

503
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,279
Should cause you to have a heart that's sorrowful

504
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,119
when you hear that.

505
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:08,639
somebody say that. Listen, I can tell them that God cares about them and God loves them.

506
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:13,439
As we look at God's word, we find this morning that God cares about us. Look over at 1 Peter.

507
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,719
I know it's a familiar verse, but I want you to turn there and I want you to see it in

508
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:21,879
your Bible this morning. And I want you to be reminded of this great truth that God gives

509
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:25,159
us in 1 Peter chapter number five. And then we're going to go to the book of Luke and

510
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,999
look at a couple of portions of scripture that I hope encourage you this morning, that

511
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:33,519
yes, we can look back to an Old Testament portion of scripture and we can rejoice in

512
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:40,159
knowing that God cares for his servants, that God cares for his people. But listen, it's

513
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,599
not just that God cares about Elijah. This morning, God cares about you personally. You

514
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,839
say, pastor, I'm going through a situation. I have this going on and I have all of this

515
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:56,459
turmoil and all of this uncertainty. God knows and God cares about you. And as you seek the

516
00:30:56,459 --> 00:31:02,419
face of God and as you surrender to his lordship in your life, then he will provide you with

517
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:08,539
the guidance that you need. And as you follow him day by day and you trust him to lead you,

518
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:16,219
he will prove himself capable and worthy. Notice the Bible tells us in 1 Peter five,

519
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:23,739
again, a very familiar verse of scripture. The Bible says this, casting all your care

520
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:36,619
upon him. Why? For he careth for you. It's a simple verse of scripture. You've seen it

521
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:45,059
maybe on some artwork. You've seen it maybe on a mug or some other piece of everyday type

522
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:52,459
of item that we would use as a reminder to people. But I want you to see that God's word.

523
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:56,699
The Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for us.

524
00:31:56,699 --> 00:32:03,499
And here, a very simple verse of scripture says this to the people of God, casting all your care

525
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:11,939
upon him. For he careth for you. What do we know about the people that Peter is writing to here in

526
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:16,519
the book of 1 Peter? Well, we know that there are people that are scattered abroad. We know

527
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,259
that there are people that are dealing with great adversity, of people that are dealing with great

528
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,899
persecution, of people that are trying to serve God under the time in which Nero is ruling and

529
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:33,139
what a cruel leader he was. And we find that they're dealing with all types of difficulties

530
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:38,059
and hardships and all these things that are going on. The Bible speaks of their sufferings within

531
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:45,339
the text of scripture. But Peter says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

532
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:55,579
casting all your care upon him. For he careth for you. What a precious truth of God's word.

533
00:32:55,579 --> 00:33:04,539
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, in chapter number 12. Luke chapter number 12. We look at a

534
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:11,339
few verses of scripture here in Luke 12 as we close this morning. The Lord Jesus Christ is

535
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:19,819
speaking. I believe in these two portions of chapter 12 that we'll look at this morning,

536
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:28,099
we're reminded of God's great care for us. As you're turning there to Luke 12, I thought it

537
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:33,859
was of interest and I wanted to reference the verse of scripture, though you do not need to

538
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:39,379
turn there. But in Psalm 147 and verse number 9, the Bible says that he, speaking of the Lord,

539
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:45,739
giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry. It's of interest to me that in

540
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:53,459
Psalm 147 and verse number 9, that God reminds us that he provides for the beast and for the

541
00:33:53,459 --> 00:34:03,019
young ravens. But it was God who used the ravens to provide for his servant. Here in Luke chapter

542
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:08,659
12, notice what the Bible says in verse number 6. The Bible says in verse number 6,

543
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:14,619
are not five sparrows sold for two far things? And not one of them is forgotten before God.

544
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:22,539
It says this in verse number 12, but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not,

545
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:30,299
therefore. Notice what he says, you're of more value than many sparrows. You're of more value.

546
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:38,219
I'm thankful that God has placed value on humanity. I'm thankful for the value that

547
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:44,819
God has placed upon humanity this morning as we think about the truth that we are valuable to God.

548
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:50,859
I've said this often, but it's worth repeating that we have value, humans have value for two

549
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:57,459
very obvious biblical reasons. One, because we're made in the image of God. If you remove the

550
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:06,179
teaching, the truth of creation, then man all of a sudden does not have value. If you follow

551
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:14,379
Darwinian evolution, man does not have value. But if you follow biblical creation, you understand

552
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:22,379
that God said let us make man in our own image, and he made them male and female, that you find

553
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:32,259
that man has value because we're made, created in the image of God. And the value of mankind

554
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:39,539
was demonstrated at a place called Calvary. When God in the person of Jesus Christ went to a cruel

555
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:51,739
cross, he bled and he died. He was buried and he rose again, but he paid a price because mankind

556
00:35:51,739 --> 00:36:00,499
is valuable. We're not redeemed with corruptible things. No, we're redeemed with the precious blood

557
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:08,339
of Christ. And here we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, he speaks about the sorrow of the sparrows

558
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:12,939
that are sold and how that not one of them is forgotten before God. And then he says this,

559
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:19,099
can you imagine? We're familiar with this thought, this truth that is given in verse number seven,

560
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:23,059
where the Bible says even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. But I want you to think

561
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:27,979
about the original audience to this particular truth. I want you to think about Jesus teaching

562
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:32,699
and those that are gathered, and Jesus saying for the very first time that they heard this,

563
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:40,219
that the very hairs of your head are numbered. Now we know it, we've read it, we're familiar with it,

564
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:44,339
we've heard somebody say it before, and so we understand it. But I want you to think about

565
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:52,459
those original audience folks that were there when they first heard Jesus say this. Isn't that amazing?

566
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:58,699
That God knows the number of the hairs on your head? Have you ever tried to count the number

567
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:05,579
of the hairs on your head? Why would you try? I often joke that God has to subtract for me.

568
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:13,259
I'm not growing any new hair, I'm losing it. Holly's giving me a haircut the other day,

569
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:15,379
she said, honey, you're getting more gray. I was like, well, at least it's gray,

570
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:22,499
because it just keeps falling out. But the reality is that God knows the number of hairs

571
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:30,779
on your head. Now think about that. It's amazing. And he says this at the end, he says,

572
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:36,099
fear not, therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows. Skip down, if you would,

573
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:43,259
to verse number 22, here in Luke chapter number 12. Notice the Bible says in verse 22,

574
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:48,459
and he said unto his disciples, therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life,

575
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:54,299
what ye shall eat, neither for the body what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat,

576
00:37:54,299 --> 00:38:00,459
and the body is more than raiment. And then he says this in verse 24, consider the ravens.

577
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:09,339
Now, as I look here at the passage of scripture, I see where Jesus says to them, consider the

578
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:14,819
ravens, and you begin to think about the use of ravens in the Bible, and we know that Noah,

579
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:20,979
he sent out a raven, and it comes, it doesn't come back, and what have you, the dove comes back,

580
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:27,819
but the raven didn't. And you find here that now you think about Elijah and the ravens in 1 Kings

581
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:32,579
17 that we studied, and here Jesus is speaking to the disciples and he says, consider the ravens.

582
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:41,259
And he says this, for they neither sow nor reap, which neither have storehouse nor barn, and notice

583
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:54,179
these words, and God feedeth them. God feeds them. But then it says this, how much more are ye better

584
00:38:54,219 --> 00:39:02,659
than the fowls? Listen, God created the fowls of the air. We can read the creation account in

585
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:07,579
Genesis chapter number 1, and we can understand that God created the fowls of the air, and we

586
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:14,899
understand that God cares for them, he feeds them, but he then says, as he gives this teaching to the

587
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:21,299
disciples, and he tells them that they can look at this earthly thought, this truth of the ravens,

588
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:26,699
and as they would consider the ravens, and here he says that God feedeth them, and then he says to

589
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:34,739
his disciples, how much more are ye better than the fowls? Now I want to remind you of a question

590
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:40,539
that the disciples asked to the Lord during a time in which they suffered in a great storm. I

591
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:47,379
mentioned earlier when I spoke about the guidance of the Lord, how that God provided the disciples

592
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:51,499
with guidance to get into a boat and go to the other side, and they encountered a storm. The

593
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:57,019
first time that happened, or that wasn't the first time that that situation happened, they were in

594
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,899
more than one storm there on the Sea of Galilee, but in one particular

595
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:05,459
instance when they're in a storm on the Sea of Galilee, it wasn't that Jesus sent

596
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:09,239
them without and then he comes walking on the water, it's that he's with them in

597
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,459
the boat. And as he's with them in the boat, they face this great storm and

598
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:24,619
Jesus is what? He's sleeping. Can you see the panic of the disciples as you read

599
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:32,179
the text of Scripture and they come to Jesus frantically and they awake him out

600
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:43,059
of sleep and they say this, Master, carest thou not that we perish? Oh no, Jesus did

601
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:50,019
care, he does care. And we find that he rebuked the wind and the storm, the waves

602
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:57,259
and there's a great calm. Here we find that God says to these same disciples, how much

603
00:40:57,259 --> 00:41:06,979
more are ye better than the fowls? I'd say to you this morning that God, he cares about

604
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:16,659
you. His care is evidenced through his guidance. Say, man, I need some direction in my life.

605
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:23,899
I know the one that you need to seek. Say, the Lord knows everything, everything. He

606
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:33,259
is the all-wise God and he wants to provide you with guidance, direction in your life.

607
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:39,999
And then his care is evidenced through his sustenance. Here, God tells us that he feeds

608
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:50,519
the ravens. But in 1 Kings 17, God used the ravens to feed his servant. Isn't that amazing?

609
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:59,199
It's absolutely amazing to me to understand God's great care for us. The songwriter said

610
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:06,839
this, does Jesus care? Does Jesus care? If you were to read through the song, you would

611
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:14,839
see in that song great sorrow that was encountered by the songwriter. But as you read and you

612
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:25,959
get into the chorus of that song, yes, he cares. I know he cares. This morning, you're

613
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:32,439
dealing with some difficulties in your life, when you're dealing with some troubles, remember

614
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:42,119
God cares about you. He cares about you and he provides guidance and sustenance and it

615
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:49,959
reveals to us his greatness. He's able to care for each and every one of us, all of

616
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:55,579
the believers all over the universe, all at the same time, and provide you with guidance

617
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:00,479
in your life with where you are, while providing guidance in someone else's life over here

618
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:08,319
for where they are, guidance for this. It's amazing how great our God is and how personal

619
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:17,879
our God is. This morning, rest in knowing that God cares for you. We see it evidenced

620
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:24,479
in Elijah's life. I hope that you've experienced in your own life to know God cares. God cares

621
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:30,279
about me personally. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank

622
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:37,679
you for the opportunity to be gathered together to sing praise to your name, to open your

623
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:46,199
precious book. God, we thank you that you care about us, you care for us. God, I pray

624
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:53,799
that you'd help us to seek your face for guidance and leadership direction. I pray that we would

625
00:43:53,799 --> 00:44:00,559
acknowledge this morning that we need your guidance. If we do not first acknowledge our

626
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:09,799
need for guidance, we'll never seek you for it. Help us to not lean on our own understanding.

627
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:15,919
Help us, Lord, to trust you and obey you. Help us to respond to the guidance that you

628
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:24,159
provide in the manner in which Elijah responded in immediate obedience. Lord, help us to know

629
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:32,859
that you care for us and you will provide sustenance. You will sustain us. No matter

630
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:42,239
the circumstances, no matter the situation, you'll provide for us. You know what we need.

631
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:51,839
You've made us. You've formed us. And your provision reminds us of your care. Help us

632
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,879
to cast all our care upon you, knowing that you care for us. I pray, Lord, that this morning

633
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:08,839
you'd help us to be, to rest in being reminded of your great care for us. I pray that you'd

634
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:13,379
move and work in hearts and lives. Maybe there's some that need guidance. They need

635
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:19,199
direction in their lives. Maybe there's some that, maybe they've said those words that

636
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:26,959
we mentioned a moment ago, no one cares about me. Maybe they feel like because of the storms

637
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:33,559
that are raging in their life, no one cares about them. God, would you help them to find

638
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:40,119
refuge in your great care. Help them to be encouraged this morning, to trust you and

639
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,799
to obey you. I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as only you can. There's

640
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:51,159
one that's not sure of heaven. I pray that today be the day of their salvation. Well,

641
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:53,359
thank you for all that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
