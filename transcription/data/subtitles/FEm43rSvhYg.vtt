WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
team this morning in your Bible, and to be looking the next few weeks at some messages

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.380
here from the life of Elijah. The Lord, I believe, as you look at his word, as we have

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.039
our theme for this year, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. We understand that

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:22.639
the Lord has graciously revealed his greatness to us through his word. And we have examined

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:29.280
several portions of scripture this year in our quest to discover the greatness of God.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.080
And I'm so thankful that God has given us a Bible, and not only has he told us that

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.840
he's great, but he's demonstrated his greatness for us. And we have the privilege of being

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.000
able to study a variety of portions of scripture and understanding, discovering the greatness

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of God. As we move into the latter part of the year, we'll shift gears slightly and deal

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.279
with now that we've discovered God's greatness, it is important that we then declare God's

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:02.799
greatness, for we have a great God and he is to be declared. We mentioned this as we

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:10.239
started the year, that creation reveals God's greatness. And we said that through creation,

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:16.199
we see the power of God, we see the wisdom of God on display, and we find that God's

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:21.879
greatness is demonstrated, is revealed to us through creation. We spent a number of

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:27.519
weeks dealing with various aspects of creation, and what God's word tells us about creation.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:34.120
And I'm so thankful that the creator God is also my helper and my deliverer, and he is

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.599
my redeemer. Obviously, as we get into the truth of redemption, begin to think about

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:46.080
the truth that the deliverance of God reveals his greatness. Again, you see his great power,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.680
you see the fact that he's our great helper. We mentioned that inspiration reveals God's

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.559
greatness. We dealt with the inspiration of God's word. I'm so thankful that this is

00:01:55.559 --> 00:02:02.300
not man's word about God, that this is the word of God. And the Bible says that all scripture

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.080
is given by inspiration of God, and what a joy and a blessing. Not only did we say that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.460
inspiration reveals God's greatness, but preservation reveals God's greatness. It's a wonderful

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.440
thing that he inspired the originals, but we don't have the originals, but he promised

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.240
to preserve his word. And what a blessing to have the truth of preservation and to understand

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.380
this morning that we can have confidence in the book that we hold in our hands, knowing

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.839
that God has promised to preserve his word. And by the way, God cannot lie. He always

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:46.880
does what he says he will do, and he obviously used people. The Bible tells us that he exalts

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.839
his word above his very name, and he is obviously in his wisdom and in his grace and mercy,

00:02:54.839 --> 00:03:01.199
he provided for us his word so that we could know him. And obviously we are without excuse

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.960
because he has given us his word. I mentioned this for a couple of weeks, that his love

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.399
demonstrates, reveals to us his greatness. We read about his great love, and I'm so thankful.

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:21.320
The songwriter said, amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God, didst die for me?

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.039
Amazing love, and God's love reveals to us just how great he is. The last couple of weeks

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:33.160
we've dealt with the truth of God's mercy, and God's mercy revealing his greatness. For

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.919
the next couple of messages, we'd like to examine how God's care for us reveals his

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.759
greatness. And we will consider some of the events from the life of Elijah, because I

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:53.119
believe that it so obviously reveals how God cares for his people. And God's care for us,

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:58.960
you think about the billions of people that are upon the face of the earth today, and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.039
nearing eight billion people in population, and it is hard for us to wrap our mind around

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:11.440
that number. There are believers all around the globe. There are people all around the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.720
globe that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal savior, and we can rejoice

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.480
in that. We've had opportunity to meet believers, brothers and sisters in Christ from all sorts

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.320
of places. As you travel abroad, you have the opportunity, maybe not to be able to speak

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.399
with someone in the language that they speak, but you still have that bond in Christ, and

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:41.160
there's just something about that, and it's so precious, and it's so wonderful. And the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.920
amazing thing about our great God is that he cares about you the same way he cares about

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.880
the someone on the other side of the globe, and every other person in between, all of

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.679
his children, he cares for us. And what a blessing to understand God's care, and I believe

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:06.880
that God's care for his children reveals just how great he is. As we look at the life of

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.600
Elijah, it's interesting, Elijah just comes on the pages of scripture, seemingly out of

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.640
obscurity. The Bible just declares in verse number one of 1 Kings 17, and Elijah, the

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.000
Tishbite. We don't have any reference of Elijah prior to this, obviously. From this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.519
point forward, for a number of chapters, we'll read several things about the life and ministry

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:36.679
of Elijah, but from obscurity, it seems as if Elijah just comes upon the pages of scripture

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:42.200
in this particular time of history, in Israel's history, when Israel is far from God, when

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.640
Israel is just, Ahab is a wicked king, and we find that Elijah comes on the scene, and

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.040
notice the Bible says, and Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.119
unto Ahab, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:11.640
nor rain these years, but according to my word. That's a bold declaration. The boldness

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.720
of Elijah, it will not be the focus of our message this morning, but we know that Elijah

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.320
knew some things, he understood some things about God. He understood that God lives, that

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.079
God is a living God. He says this, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, notice what he

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:37.359
says, before whom I stand. When we stand and serve the Lord God Almighty, when we're going

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:43.799
in His power and in His might, we can stand before even the most wicked of kings, as

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:50.679
you see Ahab here, and we can deliver what thus saith the Lord. And we find that it was

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:57.779
God who was giving this instruction and this command to Elijah, and this particular message

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:05.200
of judgment that is delivered by Elijah to King Ahab. Obviously, Elijah, in obedience

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.480
to the Lord, delivering this message of divine judgment, we find that the Bible then continues

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.320
in verse number 2 and says, and the word of the Lord came unto him, Elijah, saying, notice

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.559
what the Bible says in verse 3, down through verse number 7, get thee hence and turn thee

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:30.279
eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be that

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:36.839
thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:40.799
he went and did according unto the word of the Lord, for he went and dwelt by the brook

00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:45.619
Cherith, that is before Jordan. The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:50.720
and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook. The Bible tells us in

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.339
verse number 7, and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up, because there

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.540
had been no rain in the land. As we look at this portion of scripture this morning and

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.579
we consider God's care for his servant Elijah, and obviously God's care for us, I've titled

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:12.019
the message based on the portion of scripture where God says this in verse number 3, hide

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:17.700
thyself by the brook Cherith. Hide thyself by the brook Cherith. I would say this this

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.220
morning, that God's care, number 1 if you're taking notes, God's care is evidenced through

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:29.339
guidance. God's care is evidenced through guidance. Because God cares about his people,

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:34.460
he provides his people with guidance, with direction. And I think about the truth here

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:40.380
in the life of Elijah, as Elijah is standing there before King Ahab, king of Israel, this

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.900
wicked man, the Bible describes Ahab in verse number 33 of chapter number 16 this way, and

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.619
Ahab made a grove, and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:58.460
kings of Israel that were before him. And that's not really something to be proud about,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.500
he is a wicked man, an ungodly man, and we find that Elijah is going to stand in his

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.900
presence in obedience to the Lord God Almighty, the Lord God of Israel that liveth, and he's

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.419
going to stand there and deliver a message of divine judgment. That message of divine

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:21.099
judgment, we understand that the impact of that judgment would be severe, and it would

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:28.099
be far-reaching. You find that Elijah would suffer from the consequences of this drought

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:35.140
that is announced in verse number 1 that says there shall not be dune or rain these years,

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:42.539
but according to my word. A drought is a very serious form of judgment. We find that the

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:50.179
impacts are quite severe and far-reaching. There are times in which we have in our lives

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:55.700
experienced maybe some windows where there's a couple of weeks without rain, and we begin

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.979
to see the impact on that even so quickly.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:03.199
but can you imagine for years with no rain?

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:06.619
Years.

00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:08.299
The impact would be severe,

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:10.979
the impact would be far-reaching.

00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:12.939
But I find in the text of scripture,

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:16.939
as I mentioned that God's care is evidenced through guidance

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:21.819
that after Elijah delivers this message of divine judgment,

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:25.179
that the Lord came unto him and spoke to him,

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:26.819
according to verse number two,

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:30.739
and gave him guidance, provided him with direction.

00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:33.779
The Bible says, get thee hence in verse number three,

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.959
and turn thee eastward,

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.339
and hide thyself by the brook Cherith

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:40.659
that is before Jordan.

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.499
Now it's interesting to me that as I look at the guidance

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:46.759
that God so graciously provides in verse number three,

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.819
revealing to us his great care for his servant,

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:52.939
that this guidance, this direction that is provided,

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:56.799
is clear and it's direct.

00:10:56.799 --> 00:11:01.339
God was very clear in how he had given this instruction,

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.359
this guidance to his servant Elijah.

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:08.099
He didn't just say, hey, go eastward.

00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:10.599
How far eastward?

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:11.439
To what place?

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:14.399
When have I arrived to the place where I'm to be?

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:17.519
No, we find that God very specifically,

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:20.239
he says, turn thee eastward and hide thyself

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:23.639
by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.619
He gave him a specific location,

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:28.559
he provided him with the exact guidance

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.819
that he would need.

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:33.899
This morning, if we'd be honest,

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:36.859
we each need guidance in our lives.

00:11:36.859 --> 00:11:39.459
We need God's divine direction.

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:41.619
We need his leadership in our lives.

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:43.499
I'm thankful as you look at the Old Testament,

00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:45.459
you begin to study the Old Testament

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.859
and the children of Israel during the time

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:51.739
in which they left Egypt in the wilderness wanderings,

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:55.219
you find that God graciously and supernaturally

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:59.459
led his people through some amazing means

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:02.559
in which he gave them guidance and clear direction.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.619
It was a pillar of cloud by day

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:06.459
and a pillar of fire by night.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.779
And it was so obvious.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.719
And as the pillar of cloud would move

00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:11.259
and the pillar of fire would move,

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:12.919
they would follow the leadership.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.619
And even though they were following the leadership

00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:18.299
of God Almighty, you would find that there were times,

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.979
many times in fact, that the children of Israel

00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:22.899
would complain about the way

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:25.779
and what they discovered or found,

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.619
the hardships that they encountered.

00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:29.659
And I will say this, that there are times

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:32.419
in which God is guiding us and leading us

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:36.059
and he may lead us directly into a time of difficulty.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:40.399
It was God who told the disciples to get into the ship

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.859
and to go to the other side.

00:12:41.859 --> 00:12:46.139
And as they obeyed the Lord, there was a great storm.

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.439
They were following the direction of God.

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:52.739
But in so doing, they encountered a storm.

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:54.659
And what was it that God was going to do?

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:57.199
He was going to reveal more of his attributes,

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:59.739
more of his power to his people.

00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:01.419
And he was gonna deliver them through that.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:04.059
And we find that God provides guidance.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:07.619
And here for the servant Elijah,

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:11.739
God comes and speaks to him and gives him guidance.

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:14.459
I'm thankful this morning, unlike Elijah,

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:17.499
this morning we have the whole Bible.

00:13:17.499 --> 00:13:20.019
We have the Holy Spirit of God who dwells within us.

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:21.579
If you've been saved this morning,

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:23.539
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:26.179
as your personal savior, the Bible tells us

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:30.019
that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:32.699
that our bodies, that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:35.219
which is in us, which we have of God.

00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:38.299
We understand that God provides us with guidance

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:41.979
and direction through his word and through his spirit.

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.239
And the direction is clear.

00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:48.979
The guidance that God provides to Elijah is clear

00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:49.939
and it is direct.

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:53.819
It is not difficult for Elijah to be able to understand

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:57.439
what it is that God is giving him the guidance

00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:59.739
and it's not complicated.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:03.819
Notice that with the guidance came a promise.

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:06.659
That's what the Bible says in verse number four

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:08.179
of 1 Kings 17.

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.459
The Bible says, and it shall be

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:13.239
that thou shalt drink of the brook.

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:16.219
And then notice this promise.

00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:22.219
And I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:29.939
Do you think about the Lord God Almighty

00:14:30.859 --> 00:14:35.099
providing guidance to his servant Elijah,

00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:39.219
revealing to us his great care for his servant,

00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:43.099
but we find also that he gave commandment to the ravens.

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:47.919
By the way, the ravens are God's creation.

00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:52.219
It's interesting to me as you study through the scriptures,

00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:54.579
you'll find that outside of humans,

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:56.819
God's creation always obey him.

00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:02.219
I'm pretty confident that Jonah, the disobedient prophet

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:05.679
was thankful that that great fish was obedient to God.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:07.519
Right.

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:11.839
And then the disobedient prophet

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:16.839
became an obedient prophet after his encounter

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:19.299
and after all that had taken place.

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:21.679
But we find here, notice he says,

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:25.759
God tells Elijah that there at this place Cherith,

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.739
the brook that God has given him the direction,

00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:30.639
the guidance to go to this place.

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.739
He says, you'll drink of the water there,

00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:36.199
but he says, I've commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:40.119
Now, the Bible tells us in Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:41.639
that we're to trust in the Lord with all our hearts,

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:44.299
we're to lean not on our own understanding.

00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:46.759
If you know anything about ravens,

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:49.559
and I'm thinking, I'm assuming that Elijah

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.719
knew some things about ravens,

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:56.719
that maybe there'd be reason to wonder how are the ravens,

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.819
like, how is this going to work?

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:03.759
We don't see anywhere in the passage of Scripture

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:07.619
that Elijah doubts or questions or even hesitates

00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:10.739
at the command and the promise that are revealed to him.

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.879
And as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:15.739
and we see what's taking place

00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:18.779
and we see God's care evidenced through guidance

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:21.739
this morning for his servant, for Elijah,

00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:24.439
I'm so thankful, as I've mentioned already,

00:16:24.439 --> 00:16:27.499
that today God continues to provide guidance

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:28.739
for his children.

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:32.499
Why does he guide us?

00:16:32.499 --> 00:16:35.379
Why is it that he'd be concerned in your life,

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:38.339
in my life, in providing us with guidance?

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:41.299
Why would the God of the universe,

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.799
when you and when I are in a position in our lives

00:16:45.799 --> 00:16:48.099
and we enter into the presence of God

00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:49.139
and we're praying, we're saying,

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:52.819
God, I need your guidance, I need your direction,

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:55.499
God, would you please provide me with leadership?

00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:57.379
Why does he, why?

00:16:57.379 --> 00:16:59.699
Because he loves us and he cares about us.

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:02.259
I think about my children

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:04.179
and many of you have children this morning

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:07.339
and at some point you were a child.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:12.259
As a child, you might ask your parents for some guidance.

00:17:13.139 --> 00:17:15.939
You might seek the counsel of your parents

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:18.959
with regard to decisions that have to be made

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.699
and what have you and I'm always thankful,

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.979
it's a blessing to me when my children

00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:26.739
will contact me for guidance.

00:17:26.739 --> 00:17:27.779
You know, what's interesting now

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:30.699
is a parent of a married child

00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:33.399
is the encouragement that comes

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:36.699
when a married child will contact you for guidance

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:39.699
because there's still a level of understanding,

00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:42.859
of respect and the wisdom,

00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:44.939
not that I'm saying that I'm some wise individual

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.379
but you understand what I'm saying.

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:49.419
And this morning, when you begin to think about

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:53.499
a child coming and seeking the guidance of a parent,

00:17:53.499 --> 00:17:55.059
we understand that but we,

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:57.339
why do we give guidance to our children?

00:17:57.339 --> 00:17:59.819
Why is it, listen, there are times in which

00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:01.779
my children will say something like this

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:04.179
and it always bothers me when they say this.

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:06.019
They'll say, daddy, I know that you're busy

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:07.899
but and I say, no, no, no, no, I am not,

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:10.539
I don't ever want you to think I'm too busy for you.

00:18:12.499 --> 00:18:14.699
I want them to come and to ask and why?

00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:17.819
Because I care about them, I love them.

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.219
I wanna provide them with guidance

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:25.899
and our heavenly father who knows everything,

00:18:25.899 --> 00:18:28.059
who knows the end from the beginning,

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:30.539
who is alpha and omega,

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:34.539
though you do not know what's on the morrow, he does

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:36.859
and he provides us with guidance.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.820
He provides us with direction because he loves us.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.579
I want you to think about a few verses of scripture

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:44.419
in the book of Psalms.

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:46.179
If you turn to Psalm chapter five,

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.739
look at just a few verses here in the book of Psalms

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.419
this morning, Psalm chapter number five.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.619
Speaking of the truth of the guidance,

00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:00.139
the leadership of God Almighty,

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.779
notice the prayer of the psalmist in Psalm five,

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:05.959
a psalm that is ascribed to David in verse number eight.

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:07.339
Notice what he says,

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:12.519
lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:14.059
because of mine enemies.

00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:19.059
Notice what he says, make thy way straight before my face.

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:24.219
Make thy way straight before my face.

00:19:24.219 --> 00:19:28.219
I'm mindful of what the psalmist will say in Psalm 27

00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:30.260
in verse number 11 where the Bible says,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.579
teach me thy way, O Lord,

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:36.579
and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:39.339
How often in my life I pray

00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:41.979
that God would make the path plain

00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:45.739
and that God would make the path straight,

00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:49.659
that God would give clear guidance and direction

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:51.320
as I seek his face,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.940
and I believe that God is delighted

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.380
when we as his children seek his face for guidance.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.579
Notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 27.

00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:05.579
In Psalm 73, in verse number 24,

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:11.659
a psalm that is described to Asaph,

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:14.419
getting to the end of the psalm,

00:20:14.419 --> 00:20:18.019
and it's so precious and powerful to see

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:21.379
the great contrast as to how he starts the psalm

00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:23.099
and how he ends the psalm.

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:25.459
But notice in verse number 23,

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:28.739
the Bible says, nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

00:20:28.739 --> 00:20:31.279
Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:33.039
Can you get the imagery here?

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:37.359
Can you see as a parent would hold their hand

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:40.319
of their child, and God is our heavenly Father,

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:42.599
and we as his children, and it says this,

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:47.599
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,

00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:51.879
and afterward, receive me to glory.

00:20:51.879 --> 00:20:54.839
I hope that this morning, each of us would follow

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:56.939
the leadership and guidance of God

00:20:56.939 --> 00:20:59.039
all the days of our lives,

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:01.539
and then he would receive us to glory,

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:04.699
that when we take that final breath here upon this earth,

00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.779
that we enter into his very presence

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:09.019
and understanding that we've been guided

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.619
with God's counsel.

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.699
Where do we find God's counsel?

00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:15.579
His word, his word.

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:17.219
Notice what the Bible says in Psalm 119,

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:20.579
a verse of scripture that is quite familiar to us

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:25.579
in Psalm 119, as we begin to consider the guidance

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:29.679
and how God's care is evidenced for his people

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:32.439
through his guidance, and I'm so thankful

00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:35.679
that God provided guidance to Elijah,

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.399
but this morning, I must rest and understand

00:21:38.399 --> 00:21:41.359
that he continues to provide guidance for me

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:43.639
and for you this morning in our lives.

00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:46.039
Psalm 109 and verse 105, the Bible says,

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:49.479
thy word is a lamp unto my feet

00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:52.599
and a light unto my path.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:55.319
I'm thankful for the guidance that God gives

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:59.419
through his word, his counsel, his wisdom

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.439
that is contained therein.

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:05.159
I've said this often as I've counseled with individuals.

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:08.679
I've said this often as I've preached from God's word

00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:12.439
that God will never lead you contrary to his word.

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:16.039
God will not lead you contrary to his word.

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:18.139
God will never lead you to do something

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:21.279
that contradicts a principle that he has placed

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:22.519
within this book.

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:25.479
God's guidance and God's leadership in your life

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:30.079
will always be consistent with what God says in his word.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:31.239
Well, you don't understand, Pastor,

00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:32.719
God's just guiding me to do this.

00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:35.679
No, he's not, and I can say that

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:38.719
because of the authority of God's word.

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:42.399
Now, I understand that there are places

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:44.039
in which you can look to and you say,

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:46.839
well, God's guiding me to move to this place

00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:47.799
or go to this place.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:50.799
You're not gonna find a specific verse of scripture

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.719
that's gonna say, you know, so and so,

00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:54.839
you should live in this place or do this thing,

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:57.279
but you understand that as we look to God's word

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:01.139
that God provides us with the guidance that we need.

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:02.659
We follow his leadership.

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.319
God's care for Elijah.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:09.119
God's care for us this morning

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.579
is evidenced through his guidance.

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:12.959
Turn back to 1 Kings 17, if you will.

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.639
I would say not only is God's care evidenced

00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:19.799
through guidance, but God's care is evidenced

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:24.119
through sustenance, through sustenance.

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:26.839
The obedience of Elijah is noted in verse number five

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:29.959
of our text of scripture, where the Bible simply says this,

00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:33.959
so he, speaking of Elijah, went and did according

00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:36.059
unto the word of the Lord.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.259
Isn't that a wonderful truth, as God would record for us

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:41.059
the obedience of Elijah?

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:45.379
Listen, obedience is absolutely imperative.

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:48.419
As God would provide us with guidance and direction

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:51.579
in our lives, that we would submit to his leadership,

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:54.339
that we would obey the direction that he's given

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:55.379
to us in our lives.

00:23:55.379 --> 00:23:58.419
Listen, if Elijah decided, well, Lord,

00:23:58.419 --> 00:23:59.939
I know you tell me to go to the brook Cherith

00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:01.119
and I know you tell me to go over there,

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:04.219
but I think I know better, I think I understand

00:24:04.219 --> 00:24:06.539
the terrain and the situation better,

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:09.139
so I'm gonna go over to this place,

00:24:09.139 --> 00:24:12.299
because in my mind, it's going to be better for me there.

00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:21.199
No ravens are gonna show up there.

00:24:21.199 --> 00:24:22.039
Why?

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:23.699
Because God said specifically at the end

00:24:23.699 --> 00:24:26.339
of verse number four, and I have commanded the ravens

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:31.139
to feed thee there, there.

00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:33.299
Every word is important.

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:35.899
He didn't just say, and I have commanded the ravens

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:36.739
to feed thee.

00:24:38.739 --> 00:24:42.779
I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:43.819
Where's there?

00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:45.619
The brook Cherith.

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.219
A specific location.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:52.659
And the Bible tells us that Elijah is immediately obedient

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:56.099
to the word of the Lord, so he went and did a courting

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.739
unto the word of the Lord, and thank God

00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:03.619
for the obedience of Elijah, for we find that

00:25:03.619 --> 00:25:07.139
through his obedience that he sustained this,

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:10.299
through this period of time and the sustenances there,

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:12.859
we find that he receives a personal delivery

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:15.819
of both bread and flesh in the morning,

00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:19.499
and again in the evening by the ravens.

00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:21.339
This is absolutely amazing.

00:25:21.339 --> 00:25:23.139
You say, I'm familiar with the portion of scripture.

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:25.499
I hope that you take a fresh approach

00:25:25.499 --> 00:25:27.179
to God's word this morning.

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:28.979
I believe that if we took a servant

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:31.099
when we came in this morning and said what happened

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:33.859
at the brook Cherith, most of us, if not all of us,

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:37.619
would have said that Elijah went there and he drank

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:39.539
of the brook and the ravens brought him food.

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:42.239
We're aware of it, but I want you to see how God

00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:46.699
is caring for his servant and how he's using the ravens

00:25:48.139 --> 00:25:50.739
to bring each morning, notice what the Bible says

00:25:50.739 --> 00:25:53.019
at the end of verse number five, for he went and dwelt

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:55.019
by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan,

00:25:55.019 --> 00:25:59.539
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning

00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:02.139
and bread and flesh in the evening,

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:05.179
and he drank of the brook.

00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:06.339
Can you imagine?

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:10.579
In my mind's eye, I see Elijah.

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:12.939
I mean, he goes to the place, Tim, where God told him

00:26:12.939 --> 00:26:15.459
to go and he gets there, and on that first morning,

00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:16.299
guess what?

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:17.439
Here come the ravens.

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:19.459
Look at this.

00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:23.499
The ravens are, just like God said, the ravens are coming,

00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:27.679
and sure enough, they bring, no, ravens are scavengers.

00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:32.539
Ravens like to steal your lunch, not bring you lunch.

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:34.459
You understand what I'm saying?

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:37.019
Do you, I mean, am I telling the truth?

00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:43.079
Ravens don't wanna bring you lunch, but God commanded them.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:48.739
God commanded them, and God's creation obeys him,

00:26:49.739 --> 00:26:54.739
and those ravens came there to the brook Cherith,

00:26:57.139 --> 00:27:00.099
and they brought Elijah a meal, bread and flesh,

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:03.899
and the Bible says that he drank of the brook

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:05.779
in verse number six.

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:10.099
I don't know how long Elijah was at the brook Cherith.

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:12.779
I'm not sure of the length of time that he was there,

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:15.059
but for however long he was there,

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:17.839
each morning and each evening,

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:22.499
there was a personal delivery for Elijah

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:26.579
of bread and of flesh.

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:27.879
Isn't that amazing to you?

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:31.619
Does that not reveal to you God's care?

00:27:32.699 --> 00:27:34.579
God knows what we have need of.

00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:38.339
God created us, and the creator God knows

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.339
what we have need of, and we find that as God

00:27:41.339 --> 00:27:44.859
would make this command, he'd make this promise

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.999
to Elijah, and he would command the ravens to feed him,

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:51.379
that Elijah sat in that place, and Elijah,

00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:56.379
he experienced the blessing of God, the provision of God.

00:27:56.379 --> 00:27:59.619
God's care was evidenced for Elijah

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:03.419
through this sustenance, this food that was provided.

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:05.639
I would say to you this morning that God is able

00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:09.779
to sustain his children no matter the circumstances.

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:14.099
God is able, and though the circumstances there

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:18.139
in Cherith were, and in Israel, broadly speaking,

00:28:18.139 --> 00:28:21.279
the circumstances were going to continue to deteriorate.

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:22.119
Why?

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.539
Because there's no rain.

00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:26.299
There's no dew.

00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:29.819
The judgment, the divine judgment of God is upon the nation

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:32.739
because of their wickedness, because of their idolatry,

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:35.539
because of their sin, and God is withholding

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:39.299
the rain from them, and we find that here is Elijah

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:42.139
over by this brook Cherith, and he's eating,

00:28:42.139 --> 00:28:43.559
and he's drinking.

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:46.339
Because God cares about him,

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:50.859
and God's care is evidenced in his life.

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:53.899
You say, but pastor, the brook dries up.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:54.739
I know.

00:28:58.259 --> 00:28:59.739
And I would submit to you this morning

00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:01.579
that God knew about that as well,

00:29:03.379 --> 00:29:04.659
and God had a plan.

00:29:05.499 --> 00:29:08.739
Listen, it did not surprise God when the brook dried up.

00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:11.899
God knew that the brook would dry up.

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:12.739
Why?

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:13.799
Because there was no rain.

00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:17.459
God knew, and God had a plan.

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:21.639
We'll look at the next message as God's care continues

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:25.479
to be evidenced in the life of Elijah and how God works,

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:29.679
but as we begin to think about God's guidance

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:32.999
and God's sustenance in the life of Elijah

00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:35.599
and how it reveals to us and reminds us of the fact

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:38.039
that God cares about his servants,

00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:40.239
I want you this morning to recognize

00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:43.239
that God cares about you as an individual.

00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:44.319
He cares about you.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:48.359
I've heard people say, no one cares about me.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:49.919
You ever heard anyone say that?

00:29:51.079 --> 00:29:53.079
I've heard people say, no one loves me.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:55.919
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:00.279
Should cause you to have a heart that's sorrowful

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:01.119
when you hear that.

00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:08.639
somebody say that. Listen, I can tell them that God cares about them and God loves them.

00:30:08.639 --> 00:30:13.439
As we look at God's word, we find this morning that God cares about us. Look over at 1 Peter.

00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:16.719
I know it's a familiar verse, but I want you to turn there and I want you to see it in

00:30:16.719 --> 00:30:21.879
your Bible this morning. And I want you to be reminded of this great truth that God gives

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:25.159
us in 1 Peter chapter number five. And then we're going to go to the book of Luke and

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:28.999
look at a couple of portions of scripture that I hope encourage you this morning, that

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:33.519
yes, we can look back to an Old Testament portion of scripture and we can rejoice in

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:40.159
knowing that God cares for his servants, that God cares for his people. But listen, it's

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:45.599
not just that God cares about Elijah. This morning, God cares about you personally. You

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:49.839
say, pastor, I'm going through a situation. I have this going on and I have all of this

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:56.459
turmoil and all of this uncertainty. God knows and God cares about you. And as you seek the

00:30:56.459 --> 00:31:02.419
face of God and as you surrender to his lordship in your life, then he will provide you with

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:08.539
the guidance that you need. And as you follow him day by day and you trust him to lead you,

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:16.219
he will prove himself capable and worthy. Notice the Bible tells us in 1 Peter five,

00:31:16.219 --> 00:31:23.739
again, a very familiar verse of scripture. The Bible says this, casting all your care

00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:36.619
upon him. Why? For he careth for you. It's a simple verse of scripture. You've seen it

00:31:36.619 --> 00:31:45.059
maybe on some artwork. You've seen it maybe on a mug or some other piece of everyday type

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:52.459
of item that we would use as a reminder to people. But I want you to see that God's word.

00:31:52.459 --> 00:31:56.699
The Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for us.

00:31:56.699 --> 00:32:03.499
And here, a very simple verse of scripture says this to the people of God, casting all your care

00:32:03.499 --> 00:32:11.939
upon him. For he careth for you. What do we know about the people that Peter is writing to here in

00:32:11.939 --> 00:32:16.519
the book of 1 Peter? Well, we know that there are people that are scattered abroad. We know

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:21.259
that there are people that are dealing with great adversity, of people that are dealing with great

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:26.899
persecution, of people that are trying to serve God under the time in which Nero is ruling and

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:33.139
what a cruel leader he was. And we find that they're dealing with all types of difficulties

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:38.059
and hardships and all these things that are going on. The Bible speaks of their sufferings within

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:45.339
the text of scripture. But Peter says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:32:45.339 --> 00:32:55.579
casting all your care upon him. For he careth for you. What a precious truth of God's word.

00:32:55.579 --> 00:33:04.539
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, in chapter number 12. Luke chapter number 12. We look at a

00:33:04.539 --> 00:33:11.339
few verses of scripture here in Luke 12 as we close this morning. The Lord Jesus Christ is

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:19.819
speaking. I believe in these two portions of chapter 12 that we'll look at this morning,

00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:28.099
we're reminded of God's great care for us. As you're turning there to Luke 12, I thought it

00:33:28.099 --> 00:33:33.859
was of interest and I wanted to reference the verse of scripture, though you do not need to

00:33:33.859 --> 00:33:39.379
turn there. But in Psalm 147 and verse number 9, the Bible says that he, speaking of the Lord,

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:45.739
giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry. It's of interest to me that in

00:33:45.739 --> 00:33:53.459
Psalm 147 and verse number 9, that God reminds us that he provides for the beast and for the

00:33:53.459 --> 00:34:03.019
young ravens. But it was God who used the ravens to provide for his servant. Here in Luke chapter

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:08.659
12, notice what the Bible says in verse number 6. The Bible says in verse number 6,

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:14.619
are not five sparrows sold for two far things? And not one of them is forgotten before God.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:22.539
It says this in verse number 12, but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not,

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:30.299
therefore. Notice what he says, you're of more value than many sparrows. You're of more value.

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:38.219
I'm thankful that God has placed value on humanity. I'm thankful for the value that

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:44.819
God has placed upon humanity this morning as we think about the truth that we are valuable to God.

00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:50.859
I've said this often, but it's worth repeating that we have value, humans have value for two

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:57.459
very obvious biblical reasons. One, because we're made in the image of God. If you remove the

00:34:57.459 --> 00:35:06.179
teaching, the truth of creation, then man all of a sudden does not have value. If you follow

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:14.379
Darwinian evolution, man does not have value. But if you follow biblical creation, you understand

00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:22.379
that God said let us make man in our own image, and he made them male and female, that you find

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:32.259
that man has value because we're made, created in the image of God. And the value of mankind

00:35:32.259 --> 00:35:39.539
was demonstrated at a place called Calvary. When God in the person of Jesus Christ went to a cruel

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:51.739
cross, he bled and he died. He was buried and he rose again, but he paid a price because mankind

00:35:51.739 --> 00:36:00.499
is valuable. We're not redeemed with corruptible things. No, we're redeemed with the precious blood

00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:08.339
of Christ. And here we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, he speaks about the sorrow of the sparrows

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:12.939
that are sold and how that not one of them is forgotten before God. And then he says this,

00:36:12.939 --> 00:36:19.099
can you imagine? We're familiar with this thought, this truth that is given in verse number seven,

00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:23.059
where the Bible says even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. But I want you to think

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:27.979
about the original audience to this particular truth. I want you to think about Jesus teaching

00:36:27.979 --> 00:36:32.699
and those that are gathered, and Jesus saying for the very first time that they heard this,

00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:40.219
that the very hairs of your head are numbered. Now we know it, we've read it, we're familiar with it,

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:44.339
we've heard somebody say it before, and so we understand it. But I want you to think about

00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:52.459
those original audience folks that were there when they first heard Jesus say this. Isn't that amazing?

00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:58.699
That God knows the number of the hairs on your head? Have you ever tried to count the number

00:36:58.699 --> 00:37:05.579
of the hairs on your head? Why would you try? I often joke that God has to subtract for me.

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:13.259
I'm not growing any new hair, I'm losing it. Holly's giving me a haircut the other day,

00:37:13.259 --> 00:37:15.379
she said, honey, you're getting more gray. I was like, well, at least it's gray,

00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:22.499
because it just keeps falling out. But the reality is that God knows the number of hairs

00:37:22.499 --> 00:37:30.779
on your head. Now think about that. It's amazing. And he says this at the end, he says,

00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:36.099
fear not, therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows. Skip down, if you would,

00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:43.259
to verse number 22, here in Luke chapter number 12. Notice the Bible says in verse 22,

00:37:43.259 --> 00:37:48.459
and he said unto his disciples, therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life,

00:37:48.459 --> 00:37:54.299
what ye shall eat, neither for the body what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat,

00:37:54.299 --> 00:38:00.459
and the body is more than raiment. And then he says this in verse 24, consider the ravens.

00:38:00.459 --> 00:38:09.339
Now, as I look here at the passage of scripture, I see where Jesus says to them, consider the

00:38:09.339 --> 00:38:14.819
ravens, and you begin to think about the use of ravens in the Bible, and we know that Noah,

00:38:14.819 --> 00:38:20.979
he sent out a raven, and it comes, it doesn't come back, and what have you, the dove comes back,

00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:27.819
but the raven didn't. And you find here that now you think about Elijah and the ravens in 1 Kings

00:38:27.819 --> 00:38:32.579
17 that we studied, and here Jesus is speaking to the disciples and he says, consider the ravens.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:41.259
And he says this, for they neither sow nor reap, which neither have storehouse nor barn, and notice

00:38:41.259 --> 00:38:54.179
these words, and God feedeth them. God feeds them. But then it says this, how much more are ye better

00:38:54.219 --> 00:39:02.659
than the fowls? Listen, God created the fowls of the air. We can read the creation account in

00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:07.579
Genesis chapter number 1, and we can understand that God created the fowls of the air, and we

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:14.899
understand that God cares for them, he feeds them, but he then says, as he gives this teaching to the

00:39:14.899 --> 00:39:21.299
disciples, and he tells them that they can look at this earthly thought, this truth of the ravens,

00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:26.699
and as they would consider the ravens, and here he says that God feedeth them, and then he says to

00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:34.739
his disciples, how much more are ye better than the fowls? Now I want to remind you of a question

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:40.539
that the disciples asked to the Lord during a time in which they suffered in a great storm. I

00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:47.379
mentioned earlier when I spoke about the guidance of the Lord, how that God provided the disciples

00:39:47.379 --> 00:39:51.499
with guidance to get into a boat and go to the other side, and they encountered a storm. The

00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:57.019
first time that happened, or that wasn't the first time that that situation happened, they were in

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:00.899
more than one storm there on the Sea of Galilee, but in one particular

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:05.459
instance when they're in a storm on the Sea of Galilee, it wasn't that Jesus sent

00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:09.239
them without and then he comes walking on the water, it's that he's with them in

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:15.459
the boat. And as he's with them in the boat, they face this great storm and

00:40:15.459 --> 00:40:24.619
Jesus is what? He's sleeping. Can you see the panic of the disciples as you read

00:40:24.619 --> 00:40:32.179
the text of Scripture and they come to Jesus frantically and they awake him out

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:43.059
of sleep and they say this, Master, carest thou not that we perish? Oh no, Jesus did

00:40:43.059 --> 00:40:50.019
care, he does care. And we find that he rebuked the wind and the storm, the waves

00:40:50.499 --> 00:40:57.259
and there's a great calm. Here we find that God says to these same disciples, how much

00:40:57.259 --> 00:41:06.979
more are ye better than the fowls? I'd say to you this morning that God, he cares about

00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:16.659
you. His care is evidenced through his guidance. Say, man, I need some direction in my life.

00:41:16.659 --> 00:41:23.899
I know the one that you need to seek. Say, the Lord knows everything, everything. He

00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:33.259
is the all-wise God and he wants to provide you with guidance, direction in your life.

00:41:33.259 --> 00:41:39.999
And then his care is evidenced through his sustenance. Here, God tells us that he feeds

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:50.519
the ravens. But in 1 Kings 17, God used the ravens to feed his servant. Isn't that amazing?

00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:59.199
It's absolutely amazing to me to understand God's great care for us. The songwriter said

00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:06.839
this, does Jesus care? Does Jesus care? If you were to read through the song, you would

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:14.839
see in that song great sorrow that was encountered by the songwriter. But as you read and you

00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:25.959
get into the chorus of that song, yes, he cares. I know he cares. This morning, you're

00:42:25.959 --> 00:42:32.439
dealing with some difficulties in your life, when you're dealing with some troubles, remember

00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:42.119
God cares about you. He cares about you and he provides guidance and sustenance and it

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:49.959
reveals to us his greatness. He's able to care for each and every one of us, all of

00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:55.579
the believers all over the universe, all at the same time, and provide you with guidance

00:42:55.579 --> 00:43:00.479
in your life with where you are, while providing guidance in someone else's life over here

00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:08.319
for where they are, guidance for this. It's amazing how great our God is and how personal

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:17.879
our God is. This morning, rest in knowing that God cares for you. We see it evidenced

00:43:17.879 --> 00:43:24.479
in Elijah's life. I hope that you've experienced in your own life to know God cares. God cares

00:43:24.479 --> 00:43:30.279
about me personally. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank

00:43:30.279 --> 00:43:37.679
you for the opportunity to be gathered together to sing praise to your name, to open your

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:46.199
precious book. God, we thank you that you care about us, you care for us. God, I pray

00:43:46.199 --> 00:43:53.799
that you'd help us to seek your face for guidance and leadership direction. I pray that we would

00:43:53.799 --> 00:44:00.559
acknowledge this morning that we need your guidance. If we do not first acknowledge our

00:44:00.559 --> 00:44:09.799
need for guidance, we'll never seek you for it. Help us to not lean on our own understanding.

00:44:09.799 --> 00:44:15.919
Help us, Lord, to trust you and obey you. Help us to respond to the guidance that you

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:24.159
provide in the manner in which Elijah responded in immediate obedience. Lord, help us to know

00:44:24.159 --> 00:44:32.859
that you care for us and you will provide sustenance. You will sustain us. No matter

00:44:32.859 --> 00:44:42.239
the circumstances, no matter the situation, you'll provide for us. You know what we need.

00:44:42.239 --> 00:44:51.839
You've made us. You've formed us. And your provision reminds us of your care. Help us

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:58.879
to cast all our care upon you, knowing that you care for us. I pray, Lord, that this morning

00:44:58.879 --> 00:45:08.839
you'd help us to be, to rest in being reminded of your great care for us. I pray that you'd

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:13.379
move and work in hearts and lives. Maybe there's some that need guidance. They need

00:45:13.379 --> 00:45:19.199
direction in their lives. Maybe there's some that, maybe they've said those words that

00:45:19.199 --> 00:45:26.959
we mentioned a moment ago, no one cares about me. Maybe they feel like because of the storms

00:45:26.959 --> 00:45:33.559
that are raging in their life, no one cares about them. God, would you help them to find

00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:40.119
refuge in your great care. Help them to be encouraged this morning, to trust you and

00:45:40.119 --> 00:45:44.799
to obey you. I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as only you can. There's

00:45:44.799 --> 00:45:51.159
one that's not sure of heaven. I pray that today be the day of their salvation. Well,

00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:53.359
thank you for all that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
