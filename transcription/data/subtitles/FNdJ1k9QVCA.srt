1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We find in the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis, in the first verse, God says,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Fear not, Abram, why, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And then the psalmist would say this in Psalm 42, in verses 1 and 2,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the song that they just sang, As the heart panteth after the water brooks,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When shall I come and appear before God?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I wonder this morning how much do we really long for God.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not so that we can get something from God, but just long for God.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He's our everything.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And as they sang that song, I was so touched, and I know you were as well.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He's my heart's desire.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You alone. Alone.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The singularity of the idea that we're seeking Christ alone.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Again, not for what we might get, but just because of who He is.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm so glad that He saved me. Aren't you glad that He saved you this morning?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We sang a little bit about being saved this morning.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I hope this morning that you know for sure that heaven's your home.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If not, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how that when you take your final breath here on earth,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that you can be in the presence of Almighty God, knowing for sure that heaven is your home.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, that was all free this morning.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
2 Timothy 2 is the message, and I just was stirred up by that song this morning.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What a blessing.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I heard them practicing before Sunday school, and I love that song.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a wonderful song.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Did Ron Hamilton write that song, or he just sang?

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He's one of the ones that sang.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know that I heard it first when he would sing that song, and what a blessing.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
2 Timothy 2, we've been dealing with the subject of being a good soldier,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and I mentioned last week that for five weeks we'd be looking at the chapter,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
2 Timothy 2, a good soldier part one last week,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and as we looked at that first characteristic of a good soldier,

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we said that a good soldier endures hardness,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and there will be times of adversity and hardness and opposition that we face,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but as a good soldier we endure hardness.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're able to continue.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're able to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and to press on knowing that he has equipped us to endure.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not in my own strength.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not in your own strength.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's by the power of God that in the face of adversity and opposition and difficulty,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in the face of hardness, that we can press on, that we can endure.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This morning we'll get into the second characteristic that is given to us

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
here in 2 Timothy 2.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Notice with me in verse 3, the Bible says,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our desire, the desire of every saved individual,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
ought to be that we would be a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that it would be said of us not just that we were in the Lord's arming,

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
although that's important to know that you're in the Lord's army.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How do you get enlisted in the army?

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, you trust Christ as your Savior

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and you become a soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ and his army.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But here he says as a good soldier, not just being content with being a soldier,

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but having that ambition, that desire that I would be a good soldier.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It says in verse number 2, Thou therefore endure hardness.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That first characteristic that we looked at last week as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Notice in verse number 4, the Bible says this,

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life,

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm thankful that God has determined as we get saved

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that he's chosen us to be part of his army.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's chosen us to be a soldier in the Lord's army.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We find here in verse number 4 that the Bible says,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No man that warreth, those that are the soldiers in the Lord's army,

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
entangleth himself with the affairs of this life.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How many of you have found that there are affairs of this life?

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Amen.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How many of you have found that sometimes you can get entangled with the affairs of this life?

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And so here we find that Paul says to Timothy,

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
not only should a soldier, one that has that desire to be a good soldier,

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
not only will they endure hardness,

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but I have summarized the thought in verse number 4

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
as the second characteristic that a good soldier will avoid distractions.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A good soldier will avoid distractions.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
As we get a look at this portion of Scripture and look again at the admonition

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that the Apostle Paul is giving to his son in the faith,

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
of course, Paul knows that he would soon face a martyr's death.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The time of his departure is at hand.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He says it plainly in the fourth chapter of this letter.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we find that the Apostle Paul, seeking to pass that baton to the next generation,

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but also to give him words of encouragement to challenge him,

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Timothy, in his walk with the Lord, knowing that he's there in Ephesus

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and he has the responsibility to war a good warfare,

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
to be involved in the work that God had called him to be,

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that God had enlisted him to do.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ said this in John 17.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He said a lot of things, but one of the truths that we get

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
as we understand the portion of Scriptures he's praying there

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is he reveals to us that we're in the world, but we're not of the world.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And the reality is that we live in this world and there are affairs of this life,

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but we need to be careful that we do not get entangled with the affairs of this life.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We're going to look at this passage of Scripture and dealing with the idea of avoiding distractions.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The word distraction is an interesting word.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It means confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and calling the attention different ways.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's what a distraction is.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It is confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and calling the attention different ways.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, it's so easy to be distracted.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So easy to be distracted.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can walk through that back door right now and half of you would be distracted.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Guaranteed.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I see it every week.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have a different vantage point.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I get to see when somebody walks in, when somebody coughs,

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
when somebody opens a piece of candy.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Amen.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You open that mint.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How many of you ever tried to open a mint and you think it's,

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
if I just go real slow, they won't hear it.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, no, no, we hear it.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Amen.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's just better to just get it open and get it in.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Amen.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And you understand what I'm saying.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's why it's a distraction.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We know what distractions are.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This morning, if you're taking notes, I want to give you point number one,

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
understanding distractions and just really kind of laying the groundwork, if you will,

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
as we dig into the portion of Scripture and really consider this idea of not being entangled with the affairs of this life.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I know that each of us, if we were to answer honestly this morning,

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
there's been a time in our life that we've been distracted.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There's been a time in our life where we've not had, you hear somebody say this,

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to have your undivided attention.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You ever heard that terminology?

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why are they saying that?

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, because they want to make sure that you're focused on what they're going to say,

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because they think what they're going to say is important and probably it will be.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's some piece of instruction that we may need.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And so he says, give me your undivided attention.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The individual might say that because they know about distractions.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Have you ever observed somebody else being distracted?

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We know that we've been distracted.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Have you ever seen somebody else be distracted?

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How many of you see people on the road all the time distracted?

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Amen.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They got that phone out.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And that phone can become a distraction.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What are they supposed to be doing?

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They're supposed to be looking at where they're driving.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Amen.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You ever try to, you're trying to, this morning, Lauren was pouring coffee and I said, good morning, Lauren.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And she started to look over.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I said, don't look because you're going to spill the coffee.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Right.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So we understand.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We understand the mistake of saying good morning as she's in the middle of pouring or pouring the pot of coffee.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we understand.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Listen, if I'm to be going in this direction, but there's a distraction over here in front of me here, then I don't have my attention where it needs to be.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We have observed people that are distracted in a certain sense.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
When we talk about this idea of understanding distractions in a certain sense, distractions are part of life.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's something that we have to deal with.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We have to be aware of.

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We have to understand them.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We have to know that distractions abound.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We have to know that distractions are varied.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Not everything that distracts me is going to distract you and vice versa.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And so we understand this morning that distractions are part of life.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
However, as we begin to understand the portion of Scripture that is given to us here with regard to being a good soldier,

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
we must understand that our enemy desires, he seeks to distract us from that which is most important.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I believe that the enemy is perfectly content keeping us busy in all sorts of things that are not the most important thing.

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's perfectly content.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Not everything that's a distraction is a sin.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,480
in of itself, but if it pulls me away from what I'm supposed to be doing for

172
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
the Lord, we find that it becomes sinful. Spiritually speaking, we cannot afford to

173
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,420
be distracted. Spiritually speaking, we cannot afford to be distracted. But can I

174
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,879
tell you, the church as a whole, I'm not talking specifically about Fellowship

175
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,360
Baptist Church, but I'm talking about the church as a whole, which would include

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,159
Fellowship Baptist Church, the church as a whole has gone through a number of

177
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,639
decades being distracted. We've been distracted. There are things that

178
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,279
distract us. You know, it's amazing to me, I shared this with someone last week, it's

179
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,240
amazing to me how it's so easy, actually it was two weeks ago because I preached

180
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,200
on Wednesday night, that we ought to proclaim the gospel two Wednesday nights

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,919
ago, and it's amazing to me how we understand that that great commission

182
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,959
that was given to us is our responsibility. God's last command is our

183
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,720
first order of business, that we ought to be telling the world that Jesus saves

184
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,760
and how wonderful it is to proclaim that wonderful message. It's amazing to me how

185
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:13,040
many Christians today have a voice or they have a cause that is not preaching

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,680
the gospel. They have a cause that is not preaching the gospel. They can stand up

187
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
and they can speak on a whole host of subjects and a whole variety of things,

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,919
and they can picket and they can this and they can protest and so on and so

189
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,760
forth, but we're not proclaiming the gospel. And the reality is that the enemy

190
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,360
is perfectly content. He desires that we would be distracted, and we find that the

191
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,879
distractions, we must understand those distractions, the cost is too high.

192
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,559
Wasted time and wasted opportunities, the cost is too high. Somebody said this, we

193
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,639
can no longer afford to be asleep at the wheel. No doubt that's what's happened

194
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,519
in many, many areas of the church in America today. We've become distracted.

195
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,480
We've gotten our eyes, we've been pulled in so many different directions.

196
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,959
There's this multiplicity of objects that are crowding our mind and vying for our

197
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,479
attention, and we're being torn in different ways that we're not focused upon

198
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:16,800
what we must be focused on. Listen, a distracted soldier is a problem.

199
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,559
Do you know the enemy? I've never been in the military. I've been around the military

200
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,800
all of my life, but I've never actually served in the military, so I cannot say

201
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,039
this from a personal experience, but just simply from study and learning from other

202
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,639
folks. But you know many times the enemy will seek to distract the soldier so that

203
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,559
they can have an opportunity for a surprise attack. There are many ways in

204
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,039
which they'll distract. There are many ways in which they'll send maybe something

205
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,960
over here to be a distraction because really the assault or the attack is going

206
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,199
to come from this front, but they're simply seeking to give this distraction

207
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:57,080
over here. Why? To get the attention of the army in this direction while

208
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,000
something is actually taking place over here. We find that even in the Bible, we

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,839
find that there are times in which the enemy is using various distractions with

210
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,559
regard to what's taking place in military combat, with regard to the

211
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,600
nation of Israel and other people groups in the Old Testament. We see that. We

212
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,679
understand that. I find that as I played sports a lot as a child growing up and

213
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,320
playing sports, there'd be times in which you'd have a distraction over here so

214
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,039
that the defense would have their attention over here while actually

215
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,600
something is taking place over here. We see it in life. We're aware of how this

216
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
works, but we must understand distractions from a spiritual

217
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,360
perspective and understand this morning that we have an enemy that desires to

218
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,839
distract us, to distract us. We understand distractions, but then we must,

219
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,960
number two, identify distractions. We find that the Bible says in verse number four,

220
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,000
no man that woreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life. I

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,360
mentioned this last week that in the second chapter of the book of 2nd

222
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,600
Timothy, I believe these five characteristics are provided to us and

223
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,080
then they're explained. They're giving illustration as you study through the

224
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,759
text of Scripture. I'd like for you, as we consider this particular

225
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,519
characteristic of avoiding distractions or not being entangled with the affairs

226
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,160
of this life, to focus your attention back down to verse number 14. Notice what

227
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,720
the Bible says in verses 14 through 19. I'll read and then I'll make some

228
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,880
statements with regard to how we must identify distractions. The Bible says in

229
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,440
verse 14, of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the

230
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,679
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the

231
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,600
hearers. And so we know that in verse number 14, one of the responsibilities

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
that Timothy is given is what? To put them in remembrance. We find that in

233
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,000
verse number 14. We will note that, in fact, actually we noted that back in

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,200
1st Timothy with regard to being a good minister of Jesus Christ. In 1st

235
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,079
Timothy 4 and verse 6, if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

236
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,880
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of

237
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,920
faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. And so here we find

238
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,200
that he says in verse 14, of these things put them in remembrance. He gives a

239
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,679
charge, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no

240
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,040
profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. We're mindful of the fact that

241
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,640
in the first letter that Paul writes to Timothy, he tells him in the first

242
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,839
chapter about those that would use vain jangling or useless talk. Notice in

243
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,440
verse 15, the Bible says, study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that

244
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,679
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun

245
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,959
profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness, and their

246
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,040
word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, who concerning

247
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,320
the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and

248
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,359
overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless, the foundation of God

249
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:17,239
standeth sure, having the seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let every

250
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:23,279
one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. So we noted in verse

251
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,839
number 14 that there was this responsibility, there was this task that

252
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,000
was assigned, if you will, that he is to put the brethren in remembrance, that he

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,279
is to encourage them not to strive them outwards to no profit, which are going to

254
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,559
be to the subverting of the hearers. We find in verse 15 the task is provided.

255
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:49,440
What is Timothy to do? Study. Study to show thyself approved unto God. Why? It

256
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,679
says this, not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. You know, it's

257
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:02,640
easy to be distracted when you're studying. I'm serious. You know where it's

258
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,679
real easy to be distracted to is when you're praying. You ever pray and get

259
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,200
distracted? If you say no, I need to talk to you. I'm serious. I need to find out

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,920
your secret, because it's easy to get distracted when we're praying. It's easy

261
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,239
to get distracted when we're studying. It says study to show thyself approved

262
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:26,640
unto God. A workman is not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the the word of truth.

263
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,920
Notice verse 16, but shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase in

264
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,920
the more ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is

265
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,000
Hymenaeus and Philetus. Now notice in verse 14 and verse 16, he talks about

266
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,640
these words to no profit. In verse 14 and verse number 16, he talks

267
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,959
about these profane and vain babblings that will increase in the more

268
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:51,640
ungodliness. You know, there are times in which somebody will pretend to have a

269
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,359
question to just distract you. You say, but I'm answering a spiritual thing. Be

270
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,959
careful that it's not a distraction. You know, the Bible says so many

271
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:05,799
people talk about this being a contradiction. In fact, the Bible says in

272
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,160
Proverbs, and it's kind of a funny situation, where they talk about this

273
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,559
being a distraction, where the Bible says, answer a fool. Then he says, answer not a

274
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,640
fool. Back-to-back verses. And people, those that are critics of the Bible, say,

275
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,000
oh look, there's a contradiction. The Bible says, answer a fool, and then it

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
says, answer not a fool. You need to know when to answer and when not to answer. You

277
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,840
need to have wisdom. There are times in which you need to answer a fool according

278
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,440
to his own folly, but there are other times that you don't need to answer a

279
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,719
fool. Why? Because you don't need to be distracted with that foolishness. That

280
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,320
requires a high level of discernment. It requires a high level of wisdom. It

281
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,919
requires that we're dependent upon the Lord Jesus Christ and that we're walking

282
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
in the Spirit. And so we find here that Paul, as he's giving this instruction, we

283
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,919
find the task in verse 14, and again in verse number 15, but we find that there

284
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,799
could be distractions. I remember while I was in Bible college, and I hope that

285
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,599
you don't think this is a poor thing of my fellow classmates, but I remember

286
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,159
while we're in Bible college, there were certain days, and maybe you've had days

287
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,239
as well, where you just say, you know what, I don't feel up to the task today. I

288
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,280
really don't think I'm ready for whatever is on hand, on tap today for the

289
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,520
lesson, or so on and so forth, and every once in a while we knew which professors

290
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,280
you could distract, and every once in a while somebody would ask a question to

291
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,520
start the class to just totally get the subject on something else. And they would

292
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,960
do that on purpose. Why? Because they didn't want to deal with the subject

293
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,679
that was at hand, and they kind of wanted to have an easy class, an easy day, if you

294
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,520
will, and I always thought that was an odd situation, but it happened

295
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,359
occasionally, especially with one in particular professor, because he was

296
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:56,159
easily distracted. It was very easy to get him off course and go on tangents

297
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,960
and what-have-you, but we find here that Paul, as he's saying to Timothy, listen...

298
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,560
be careful, there are false teachers,

299
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,180
we've already dealt with that in the first book,

300
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,400
all of these things that are going on in Ephesus,

301
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,280
but be careful not to be distracted

302
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,040
from teaching the brethren

303
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,840
and putting the brethren in remembrance

304
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,440
and studying yourself.

305
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,160
We find that he mentions about these in particular

306
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,480
by name in verse 17 about their word,

307
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,800
hymenaeus and phyletus.

308
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,440
Notice he says, will eat as doth a canker.

309
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,040
And he says in verse 18,

310
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,920
who concerning the truth have erred

311
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,760
and so we need to know the truth,

312
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,040
we need to be grounded and settled in the truth,

313
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,240
we need to be students of the word

314
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
and then notice what it says, they've erred

315
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,440
and then it says saying that the resurrection

316
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,800
has passed already.

317
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,760
So the specifics with regard to their error is mentioned

318
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,160
and then it says and overthrow the faith of some,

319
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,000
the impact of that situation.

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,440
And so we find that we need to be careful

321
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,360
of those that will seek to have these conversations

322
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,040
and these distractions and they sometimes is given here,

323
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,680
these that are mentioned by name

324
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,040
that they have erred from the truth

325
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
and they're really those that have these words

326
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,000
to no profit, those that are these profane

327
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
and vain babblings and they increase to more ungodliness

328
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,200
and we find that here as Timothy has the responsibility

329
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,480
to be able to minister effectively,

330
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,560
to be able to be the pastor at the church at Ephesus

331
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
that God has called him to be,

332
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
he has to be aware of the fact that no man as a good soldier,

333
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
no man that worth entangle with himself

334
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
with the affairs of this life

335
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
and let me help you understand

336
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,320
as we go through the text of scripture

337
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,800
that Paul says to Timothy,

338
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,320
here are some of your responsibilities, the tasks

339
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
and here's what you need to be aware of,

340
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,600
here's the distractions that you need to be aware of.

341
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,480
Now in your life and in my life,

342
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,860
as I mentioned a moment ago, distractions will vary.

343
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,780
Not everything that distracts you distracts me,

344
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,740
not everything that distracts your spouse distracts you,

345
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,260
not everything that distracts your children distracts you,

346
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,020
we understand that.

347
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,880
There are things that distract us

348
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,900
and not everything is going to be the same

349
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,860
but here's what we need to be mindful of,

350
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,580
we need to as we identify,

351
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
we talked about understanding distractions

352
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,820
and we understand the way the enemy is working

353
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,620
but then we need to identify distractions.

354
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,420
How do I identify distractions in my life?

355
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,020
Well, it requires some inspection,

356
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,300
it requires let a man examine himself,

357
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,660
it requires some honesty and some humility

358
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,460
that we would analyze our lives,

359
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,780
that we would examine our lives

360
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,480
and we would answer truthfully and honestly,

361
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,180
what is it that's distracting me

362
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,000
from what God has called me to do?

363
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,380
What is it that's a distraction?

364
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,320
They said that this song,

365
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,880
that they sang this morning

366
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,240
and what a wonderful song it was,

367
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,240
you alone are my heart's desire

368
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
but you know there's a lot of things

369
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,360
that are gonna try to distract with that stated goal.

370
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,080
I thought about the kids,

371
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,680
Natalie and Zachary and Ari singing,

372
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,960
not that I wasn't thinking of Pierre and Kimberly singing

373
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
but I thought about the kids and how they,

374
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
my prayer for the young people in our church regularly

375
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
is that they would be saved at a young age

376
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,420
and then they would grow up to serve the Lord

377
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,200
all the days of their lives.

378
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
As they sang that song,

379
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,080
my prayer and my thought for Natalie and Zachary

380
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,440
and for Ari is that truly their heart's one desire

381
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,760
would be the Lord Jesus Christ and living for him

382
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,240
but I know and you know

383
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,720
that there's gonna be a lot of things

384
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
in those kids' lives that are gonna try to distract them

385
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,760
from fulfilling that stated goal.

386
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,980
Am I not right?

387
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,700
And it's true in your life as well.

388
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,000
It's true for Pierre and Kimberly.

389
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,880
Listen, just because they're adults,

390
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,000
the youngest in our presence this morning

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,580
up to the very oldest in our presence this morning,

392
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,820
the enemy still wants to distract you

393
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,560
regardless of your age.

394
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,400
The enemy wants to distract you

395
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,560
from doing what God wants for you to do

396
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,540
and so we must acknowledge this morning

397
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,440
this truth of what are the distractions.

398
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,000
We must identify these distractions in our lives.

399
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
Why?

400
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,800
Because we want to live a life of obedience

401
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,040
to the word of God that brings honor and glory

402
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

403
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm gonna be a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ

404
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,940
and so we must identify distractions.

405
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,200
It's important that we have in our lives

406
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,720
a time of examination that we say,

407
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
what is it that distracts me?

408
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,400
Can you be honest and can you be humble

409
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
and go through that process

410
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,440
because I guarantee you this morning

411
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,140
that for every single one of us,

412
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,500
there are things that distract us

413
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,140
and we're never going to be able to avoid those

414
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,780
as we're gonna get to in just a moment

415
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,720
if we don't identify them.

416
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,880
It's gonna go a long way to helping us avoid them

417
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,800
if we can take the step of identifying them.

418
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,140
Can I tell you this morning,

419
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,340
it takes that level of humility.

420
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,300
It requires that we would take and examine

421
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,020
and take the time to be able to identify why.

422
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,780
That's why I can root them out so that I can be,

423
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,100
listen, have you ever been in a situation

424
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,900
where you say, I'm not gonna get distracted.

425
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,620
It's not just self-will power.

426
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,740
I'm not gonna let it distract me.

427
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm not gonna let it distract.

428
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,860
It's already distracted you.

429
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,340
Am I right?

430
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,740
If you're sitting there saying,

431
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,180
I'm not gonna let that thing distract me,

432
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,340
I'm not gonna let that thing,

433
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,820
it distracted you because you know what's on your mind?

434
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,300
I'm not gonna let it distract me.

435
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,860
It did.

436
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,940
It's already done.

437
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,860
So we have to go through this process of examination.

438
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,180
What is it that distracts us?

439
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,060
A lot of things.

440
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,980
I don't even have a list.

441
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I didn't provide a list.

442
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,380
I'm not gonna go through a list.

443
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
Why?

444
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,620
Because they vary for all of us.

445
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,660
And really what I want you to do

446
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,780
is in your time this afternoon and this week,

447
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,420
I wanna encourage you to identify

448
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,900
the distractions in your life.

449
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,060
You know the easiest way to identify the distractions

450
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,380
is when you're in a situation where you're distracted.

451
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,340
The easiest way to identify distractions

452
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,140
is when you're going through life and you get distracted.

453
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,620
You say, hmm, that's something that distracts me.

454
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,620
I mentioned this, I wrote a little article.

455
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,780
We used to have a Fellowship Baptist Church newsletter

456
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,340
that we'd put out once a month,

457
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,420
and we'd have that,

458
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,220
and I put a little article in there several years ago,

459
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,060
and I titled the article Unplugged,

460
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,420
and how important it is to disconnect, and why?

461
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,980
Because my phone can be a distraction,

462
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,380
and I know that your phone can be a distraction.

463
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
I'm not talking about distracting you when you're driving.

464
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,020
I'm talking about distracting you when you're reading,

465
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,920
when you're talking, when you're having family time,

466
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
when you're, you fill in the blank.

467
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,220
Your phone can be a distraction.

468
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,260
I keep my phone on silent 24-7.

469
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,040
I never turn my phone off.

470
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,220
I keep it on silent all the time.

471
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,640
I don't turn it off because somebody might need me

472
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,500
in some weird hour because some medical or some whatever,

473
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,740
and so I keep it on, but I keep it on vibrate.

474
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,580
Why?

475
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,180
Because I don't want the ding or the whatever,

476
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,460
not even vibrate, just silent,

477
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,980
because if it's on vibrate, it still sits there

478
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,620
and goes, zzz, zzz, right?

479
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,500
It's still a distraction, so I can have it on silent,

480
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,900
but I have a watch that tells me when it's,

481
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,820
so sometimes I gotta take the watch off.

482
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,660
Why?

483
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,980
Because I don't want to be distracted.

484
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,340
Need to have some focused time.

485
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,780
I don't want to be distracted.

486
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,420
I asked the Sunday school class this morning

487
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,980
how many of you have gone out to a restaurant before

488
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,940
and you've seen the entire family sitting at the table

489
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,540
on a device?

490
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,660
See it all the time, all the time.

491
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,300
Did you hear me?

492
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
You ever hear somebody say that?

493
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,780
I heard you.

494
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Okay, well, what did I say?

495
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh, now you're in trouble, right?

496
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,820
Why?

497
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,300
Because you were distracted and they knew it.

498
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,600
They knew you were distracted.

499
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,140
Listen, the enemy doesn't care, ultimately.

500
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,180
He doesn't care so much about what it is that distracts us,

501
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,860
just so much as we're distracted.

502
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,540
They don't really care what it is.

503
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,820
Politics can distract you.

504
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,660
Come on.

505
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,260
Come on.

506
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,640
I know we live in a very political era.

507
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,220
By the way, it's been a soapbox

508
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,820
that a lot of believers have gotten on

509
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,780
and they've not spoken as much about the gospel

510
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,340
as they have about politics.

511
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,740
I would say this, I said this to somebody on Tuesday,

512
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,420
somebody that was here doing some work at the church.

513
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,780
They asked me about politics and I said,

514
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,820
you know, I think politics is the new religion in America.

515
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,660
It really is.

516
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,740
It's become a religion in America.

517
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,980
Terrible, terrible.

518
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,140
Why don't we talk about the Bible?

519
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,420
Let's talk about what the Bible says.

520
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,660
What are the Bible issues?

521
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,340
The Bible speaks about life.

522
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,740
We ought to know what it says about life.

523
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,960
The Bible talks about gender.

524
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,500
We ought to know what it says about gender.

525
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,100
The Bible talks about race.

526
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,679
We ought to know we're all, listen, there's one race.

527
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,200
It's the human race.

528
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,460
The Bible talks about all these things,

529
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,320
but what our world has done is they've made them

530
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,880
political things to divide.

531
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,240
We find this morning that there are things

532
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
that can distract us.

533
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,860
We get so caught up in these things

534
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,320
and these areas of focus that we get distracted

535
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,020
for understanding why we're even here.

536
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,500
Why did God leave us here?

537
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,220
Did he leave us here for some political movement?

538
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,059
No.

539
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,100
No, he left us here to preach the gospel

540
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,420
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

541
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,500
Amen?

542
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,179
That's what he left us here for.

543
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,020
And we find that the enemy, he wants to distract you.

544
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,740
He wants to distract me.

545
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,780
He'll use all sorts of means, and I encourage you,

546
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,540
as we look at the text of Scripture,

547
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,100
no man that woreth entangleth himself.

548
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,220
with the affairs of this life. When we look at this idea of distractions, we must first

549
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:14,360
understand them and understand how they work. Have you ever tried to distract somebody?

550
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,200
I'm sure many of you have. You've tried to distract somebody. And you know when you were

551
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,780
successful at distracting them, you've been distracted. We understand them. We have to

552
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,820
identify them in your life. Identify what distracts you. And then I would say number

553
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,140
three this morning, we must avoid distractions. How can I avoid becoming distracted? How can

554
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:46,140
I avoid living a life really focused on something other than what the main goal should be? The

555
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,160
goal of every believer we find here in the text of Scripture, the Bible says that he

556
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,620
may please him who has chosen to be a soldier, which is going to be a message for a future

557
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,400
week, but we find that we are soldiers in the Lord's army. He says in verse 3, a good

558
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,280
soldier of Jesus Christ. How is it, what is it that should be the goal of every believer?

559
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,540
A life lived, I mentioned this a moment ago, in obedience to the Word of God that brings

560
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:21,060
honor and glory to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That ought to be your stated goal.

561
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,280
It's not just the goal of the pastor. It's not just the goal of the deacon. It's not

562
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,920
just the goal of the Sunday school teacher or the, whomever it might be. No, it ought

563
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,380
to be the goal of every child of God that we understand that we're a soldier in the

564
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,860
Lord's army. I want to be a good soldier. I want to please him that calls me, that has

565
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,340
called me to be a soldier, and I want to live a life of obedience to his Word so that he

566
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:50,900
alone would receive the honor and glory that is due unto his name. But along that, along

567
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,400
life, even if we have that stated goal, there's going to be distractions that come. There

568
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,560
are going to be distractions that abound. And we say, how do we avoid those distractions?

569
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,600
What is it that we can do in order that we might avoid those distractions? How is it

570
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,320
that we can remain focused on the goal that is set before us? Remember, we talked about

571
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,840
last week looking at the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ in Hebrews chapter 12, but we

572
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,840
notice that the Bible says, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. We begin

573
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,920
to think about a race, and the race, the goal of the one running the race is to finish.

574
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,320
They have to have their eye on the goal, on the finish line. If they're looking elsewhere,

575
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,840
they're not going to end up where they need to end up. They don't need to be distracted.

576
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,000
I've read a number of times over the years where runners have given testimony about leading

577
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the pack and coming close to the finish line and being distracted by somebody either in

578
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,280
the crowd or by how close the person is behind them, and they've lost the race because they

579
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,040
got distracted for just that long. Listen, this morning we're running a race. We need

580
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,280
to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. But I want you to look

581
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,480
at, just for a moment, the example of the Apostle Paul. Turn back to Acts chapter 20,

582
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,360
if you will. So often we use the example of the Apostle Paul because God gives us so much

583
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,240
in his word about the Apostle Paul, and we have the opportunity to read of his life and

584
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,920
his ministry and his missionary journeys. We have the opportunity to be able to see

585
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,040
about his interactions with other believers and his example, his teaching, so on and so

586
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,300
forth. And so I look in Acts chapter 20, and I think about this passage often as we're

587
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:38,120
teaching and preaching through 1 and 2 Timothy because this particular passage in Acts chapter

588
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,880
number 20 is actually spoken to the church leaders at Ephesus. He called for them, according

589
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,400
to verse number 16 and 17, verse 17, he called the elders of the church, those pastors, the

590
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,680
leaders of the church to come, and he's going to have this conversation with them. And in

591
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,560
the midst of the interaction, we find great truth that is given to us with regard to the

592
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,680
Apostle Paul in his own personal life, avoiding distractions and seeking to be focused on

593
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,080
the goal of pleasing the Lord. Notice in verse 24, I do not have time to read the entirety

594
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,080
of this passage with regard to the entirety of the message, but notice Paul says this,

595
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,160
but none of these things move me. Now just pause there just for a moment. Paul's going

596
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,280
to mention about a course that he's running and finishing a course, and again we use the

597
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,640
analogy as we see that Paul uses often of a race, and we find that God has given us

598
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,640
that picture, that analogy, so that we can understand. And he says, none of these things

599
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,520
move me. There are things that you can find here within the text of Scripture where he

600
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,600
talks about how that he did not know what he would face when he would go to Jerusalem

601
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,680
at the end of verse 22, not knowing the things that shall befall me there. And we find that

602
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,840
there are bonds, he talks about in verse 23, and afflictions abide me. The Apostle Paul

603
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,480
knew what it was to suffer. He knew what it was to deal with all of these things, and

604
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,560
he says, none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself. Now think

605
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,920
about these two phrases. He says, none of these things move me. I'm not going to be

606
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,240
moved to change the course of my direction by any of these things. The things that are

607
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,080
unknown, according to verse 22, I don't know what's going to befall me, or the things that

608
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,560
are known, in verse number 22, sorry, the things that shall befall me, he doesn't know

609
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,800
verse number 23, the bonds and the afflictions that abide him, so he's not going to allow

610
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,480
the known or the unknown. Now think about that just for a moment. Paul knew some things,

611
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,080
but then he didn't know some things, and he said, none of those things are going to move

612
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,680
me. You know, sometimes we're moved by things that we know, or even things that we don't

613
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,520
know. People, somebody said this, you know, it's amazing to me, everything that I worry

614
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,920
about, it never comes to pass, as if worry caused it not to happen. No, the fact of the

615
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,360
matter is that we worry about a lot of unknown things. We worry about a lot of things that

616
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,920
might could happen, and they just never happen. And somebody said this about worry, it's like

617
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,600
a rocking chair to keep you busy, but it won't get you anywhere. And God said, be careful

618
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,420
for nothing, amen? But in everything we're to do, we're to pray, we're to seek the face

619
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,000
of God with thanksgiving, understanding that he knows all things. But Paul says, I'm not

620
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
going to let the things that I don't know, and I'm not going to let the things that I

621
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,480
do know, I'm not going to let them move me. Wow, praise the Lord. You know, there's some

622
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,760
things in life that you don't know. And by the way, I would tell you, you should be glad

623
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,760
that you don't know. One of the kings of Israel, his name was Saul, and he didn't know what

624
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:54,960
was going to happen in battle. Samuel had died. Saul was a wreck. He'd abolished all

625
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,520
the soothsayers in the land, but he said, find me a soothsayer, because I want to find

626
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Samuel and I want to see what's going on. And then he found out that he was going to

627
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
die in battle. It would have been better if he didn't know what was going to happen. But

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,920
he found out he was going to die in battle, and he was frozen. He couldn't do anything,

629
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,640
he was frozen. Just freeze up, why? Because of the now what he knew. Obviously, we know

630
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,600
that he goes on, and sure enough, he dies in battle. We find here, there's some things

631
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,200
that we don't know. You know, so often people are so concerned about the unknown, and they're

632
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,400
not doing what we know that we're supposed to be doing. They're distracted by the unknown.

633
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,920
They're distracted about things that God hasn't revealed to us. They're distracted about,

634
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,120
I want to know this, and I want to know that. Now listen, there are certain things that

635
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:53,080
God has told us, and there are certain things that God hasn't told us. And God knows best,

636
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,440
and God's way is always best, and whatever it is that he's chosen not to tell us, we

637
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,260
just leave it as that's an unknown, and it's not for me to be concerned about, and it should

638
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,200
not distract me. Amen? Paul said, I'm not going to worry. I'm not going to, the things

639
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,120
that I know, the bonds and afflictions, but the things that I don't know, they're not

640
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,320
going to move me, but none of these things move me. Notice he says, neither count I my

641
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,520
life dear unto myself. Somebody said this, they offered in Sunday school class this morning

642
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,920
in our marriage class, that there's a problem with the me-centered approach, being so centered

643
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,480
on self. Certainly in our society, we see that all around. But Paul says, neither count

644
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,360
I my life dear unto myself. How could he say that? Because he said, I am crucified with

645
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,000
Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now

646
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
live in the flesh, I live by the power of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,040
for me. Hallelujah. He said, I die daily. He has the understanding, Paul does, that

648
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,160
he's bought with a price, and he's going to glorify God in his body. Why? Because he's

649
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,440
not his own. And he says, I don't count my life dear unto myself. I'm not going to worry

650
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,360
about all those things, but here's what I'm concerned with, so that I, notice in verse

651
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:16,700
24, might finish my course with joy. Paul had a goal in life, and that was to finish

652
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:23,720
his course with joy. Paul had this stated objective, if you will, that I want to finish,

653
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,820
but I don't want to just barely get across the finish line. I want to finish my course

654
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,600
with joy. Can I tell you this morning, it's not going to happen on accident. It's not

655
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,520
going to happen by chance. And can I tell you this morning, that that course is going

656
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,720
to be lined with distractions. Going to be lined with distractions. And so Paul says,

657
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,960
I'm not going to let these things move me. I don't count my life dear unto myself. Why?

658
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,640
Because I want to finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of

659
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:58,480
the Lord Jesus Christ, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. Paul understood that

660
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,200
he had been called by God. Paul understood that he had a responsibility before the Lord.

661
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,880
and he desired to finish with joy

662
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
what God had called him to do.

663
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,700
I believe that Paul was regularly aware of the fact

664
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,320
that one day he would stand before the Lord Jesus Christ.

665
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,840
Why do I believe that he was aware of that?

666
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,480
Because he taught it.

667
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960
He taught it to the believers that he's ministering to.

668
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,080
He's warning every man, why?

669
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,880
So that they might be able to present them

670
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,920
perfect or complete in Christ,

671
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,440
and that's the ministry of Paul.

672
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,780
He's regularly aware personally

673
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,120
that he would stand before the Lord Jesus Christ,

674
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,900
and he desired, I wanna finish.

675
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,620
I don't wanna be entangled with the affairs of this life.

676
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,500
I wanna avoid those distractions.

677
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,340
Why?

678
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,500
Because I wanna finish my course with joy.

679
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,340
I wanna be able to stand before God,

680
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,320
and I wanna hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

681
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,620
I want God to be pleased with my life

682
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,020
to know that I finished what he gave me to do.

683
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,540
You say, well, God didn't call me to the ministry

684
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,400
like he called Paul.

685
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,700
God called you to service.

686
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,020
God has a plan for every one of his people.

687
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,580
God has a plan for every one of his people.

688
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,560
For some, it is full-time ministry.

689
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,700
It is being a pastor and evangelist,

690
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,000
a missionary, so on and so forth,

691
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,620
but the reality is that that call, we understand,

692
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,920
is not for every single child of God,

693
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,240
but every single child of God

694
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,840
has been called to be a soldier,

695
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,220
and to be a good soldier, to be a good soldier.

696
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,660
In the Marine Corps, they called it duty,

697
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,160
and that's when a particular Marine

698
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,000
was to be on duty, on guard, on watch.

699
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,880
The Navy, I have found, at least as far as Evan is concerned,

700
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
they call it watch.

701
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,400
I remember Juliana saying, Evan has watch.

702
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,360
Has watch, well, I wasn't familiar with the term initially

703
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,920
because I always heard from my dad, being a Marine,

704
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,360
that it was always duty.

705
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,160
I'm not sure what every branch

706
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,960
of the armed forces would refer to it,

707
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,820
but we understand the idea that there's some people

708
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,420
that are on guard, that are on duty,

709
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,820
they're on watch, they have a responsibility,

710
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,260
and those that are supposed to be watched for

711
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,340
are counting on their watchers,

712
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,400
if I could use that term, not being distracted.

713
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,900
Does that make sense this morning?

714
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,260
Because if they're distracted, if the one on watch,

715
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,840
if the one on duty, if the one on guard is distracted,

716
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,400
then guess what happens to the whole?

717
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
They become vulnerable.

718
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,400
They become vulnerable.

719
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,240
This morning, can I talk to the dads, the husbands?

720
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,360
The enemy wants to distract you

721
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,520
because your family becomes vulnerable.

722
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,300
If you're distracted from fulfilling your role

723
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,880
as a husband and as a father,

724
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,640
your family becomes vulnerable.

725
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,280
To the moms, to the wives,

726
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,920
if you're distracted, you become vulnerable.

727
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,960
You say, man, I'm glad I'm not a dad, I'm not a mom.

728
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,320
Maybe you will be one day.

729
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,700
To the pastor, that's me.

730
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,220
The flock is vulnerable if I'm distracted.

731
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,220
The Bible tells me, as a pastor,

732
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,020
that I watch for your souls.

733
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,880
That's just one of many responsibilities

734
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
that the pastor has, but how weighty of a responsibility.

735
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,840
The people of God can no longer be asleep at the wheel.

736
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,520
We cannot afford to be distracted.

737
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,240
If we wanna be a good soldier,

738
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,520
a good soldier endures hardness,

739
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,320
but a good soldier avoids distractions.

740
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,140
If a soldier was found asleep while they're on watch,

741
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,580
there were some high stakes.

742
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,420
In fact, we find that the Philippian jailer,

743
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,780
he was ready to kill himself

744
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,380
because of the fact that he thought

745
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,940
that those that were incarcerated were free.

746
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,900
We find that Herod was ready to kill,

747
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,480
gave execution orders, why?

748
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,640
Because of the fact that Peter was released from prison.

749
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,279
The Bible says that he commanded in verse number 19

750
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:31,080
that they should be put to death.

751
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,480
Why?

752
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,920
Because he assumed they were sleeping.

753
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,320
He missed the whole miracle part of God delivering Peter.

754
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,460
There were high stakes, high responsibility.

755
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,400
Can I tell you this morning

756
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,360
that we're soldiers in the Lord's army?

757
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,020
We ought to desire to be a good soldier.

758
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,600
We have to avoid distractions.

759
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,900
The distractions abound.

760
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,860
Notice what Paul says.

761
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,220
I'll close with this in 1 Corinthians 9.

762
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,000
In 1 Corinthians 9, the apostle Paul says,

763
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,700
in verse 23,

764
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,700
and this I do for the gospel's sake,

765
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,320
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

766
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,880
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

767
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,240
but one receiveth the prize?

768
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,440
So run, notice that ye may obtain.

769
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,520
And every man that striveth for the mastery

770
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
is temperate in all things.

771
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,360
That's that level of self-control.

772
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,840
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,

773
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,460
but we, an incorruptible.

774
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,620
He's using an analogy here of the games

775
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,900
that they would be aware of,

776
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,980
and we think about Olympic games and what have you

777
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,420
and the understanding of those that are running a race,

778
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,300
those that are competing

779
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,380
in a particular field of competition,

780
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,820
how that they're competing with the goal of winning.

781
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,500
They, however, are going to receive a corruptible crown,

782
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,059
but we, an incorruptible.

783
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,779
And I want you to think about the way

784
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,120
in which these that run,

785
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,080
that they participate in whatever it is

786
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,020
the particular discipline is,

787
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,420
that they have that goal that they're running

788
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,860
so that they could obtain,

789
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,360
that they want to have that prize,

790
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,820
and there's a lot of training that has to take place.

791
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,880
You know, there are many people

792
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,360
that have given testimony of being Olympic gold medalists

793
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,700
that have talked about not taking any days off,

794
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,240
not being distracted to eat something

795
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,080
that would not be good for them

796
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,980
with regard to their ability to compete,

797
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,059
not being involved in an activity

798
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:41,980
that would hinder their ability to compete,

799
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,820
so on and so forth.

800
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,500
And Paul says, I therefore, in verse number 26,

801
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,180
so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I,

802
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,600
not as one that beateth the air,

803
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,100
but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection

804
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,180
lest that by any means when I have preached to others,

805
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,380
I myself should be a castaway,

806
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,900
to be useless or of no value.

807
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,080
He says, no, I want my life to count for Christ.

808
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,000
I want to be a good soldier.

809
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,240
But there are a lot of distractions.

810
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,160
This morning, you might already know how you're distracted.

811
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,640
In fact, maybe someone here this morning,

812
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,420
maybe several would say, I'm distracted all the time.

813
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,640
I'm just distracted.

814
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,740
The enemy has gotten me so distracted on these other things.

815
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,200
I don't know what they are, but you do.

816
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
The Holy Spirit of God has an ability to take his finger

817
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,460
and touch the heart of his people.

818
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,160
I don't know what the distractions are in your life.

819
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,520
I know what they are in my life.

820
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,960
And I know that we need to avoid them.

821
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,140
I know that we need to understand how the enemy works.

822
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,040
We need to identify them so that we can avoid them.

823
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,720
We need to have this goal that Paul did,

824
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,980
that I might finish my course with joy.

825
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,340
I'm gonna stand before God one day, and so are you.

826
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,960
I hope that brings a level of soberness, sobriety,

827
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,320
to our minds, to our hearts,

828
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,000
that I'm gonna stand before God one day,

829
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,600
and I'm gonna give an account.

830
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
And I don't want to stand before God and say,

831
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,520
I was asleep at the wheel.

832
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,360
I don't want to stand before God and say,

833
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,320
well, all these other things.

834
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,160
No, there were distractions.

835
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,040
It says, no man that woreth entangleth himself

836
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,400
with the affairs of this life.

837
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,420
Oh, that God would help us to be focused

838
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,739
on what we should be focused on,

839
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:38,660
to keep our eyes on Jesus, to finish our course with joy,

840
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,100
and to avoid the distractions.

841
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,940
Let's pray together.

842
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,820
Father, we love you.

843
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,760
We thank you for loving us.

844
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,679
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation

845
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,020
that you'd have your will and way in our lives.

846
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,480
Lord, help us to be honest and to be humble.

847
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,340
Help us, Lord, to confess what we need to confess

848
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,780
and forsake what we need to forsake.

849
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,260
And Lord, we thank you

850
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,660
that you're a loving, gracious, merciful God.

851
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,900
I pray that you'd help us, Lord,

852
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,980
to finish our course with joy,

853
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,380
that we'd keep our eyes on Jesus,

854
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,299
the author and finisher of our faith.

855
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,179
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

856
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:18,460
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

857
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,059
Would you stand with me?

858
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:21,260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

859
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,859
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

860
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:25,679
As she does, the altar is open.

861
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,239
