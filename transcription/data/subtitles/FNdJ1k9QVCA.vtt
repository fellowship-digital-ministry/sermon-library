00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We find in the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis, in the first verse, God says,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Fear not, Abram, why, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And then the psalmist would say this in Psalm 42, in verses 1 and 2,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the song that they just sang, As the heart panteth after the water brooks,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When shall I come and appear before God?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I wonder this morning how much do we really long for God.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Not so that we can get something from God, but just long for God.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He's our everything.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And as they sang that song, I was so touched, and I know you were as well.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
He's my heart's desire.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You alone. Alone.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The singularity of the idea that we're seeking Christ alone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Again, not for what we might get, but just because of who He is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm so glad that He saved me. Aren't you glad that He saved you this morning?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We sang a little bit about being saved this morning.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I hope this morning that you know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If not, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how that when you take your final breath here on earth,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that you can be in the presence of Almighty God, knowing for sure that heaven is your home.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, that was all free this morning.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
2 Timothy 2 is the message, and I just was stirred up by that song this morning.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What a blessing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I heard them practicing before Sunday school, and I love that song.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a wonderful song.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I don't know.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Did Ron Hamilton write that song, or he just sang?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He's one of the ones that sang.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't know.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I know that I heard it first when he would sing that song, and what a blessing.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
2 Timothy 2, we've been dealing with the subject of being a good soldier,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and I mentioned last week that for five weeks we'd be looking at the chapter,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
2 Timothy 2, a good soldier part one last week,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and as we looked at that first characteristic of a good soldier,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we said that a good soldier endures hardness,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and there will be times of adversity and hardness and opposition that we face,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but as a good soldier we endure hardness.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We're able to continue.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We're able to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and to press on knowing that he has equipped us to endure.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's not in my own strength.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's not in your own strength.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's by the power of God that in the face of adversity and opposition and difficulty,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in the face of hardness, that we can press on, that we can endure.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This morning we'll get into the second characteristic that is given to us

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
here in 2 Timothy 2.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Notice with me in verse 3, the Bible says,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Our desire, the desire of every saved individual,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
ought to be that we would be a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that it would be said of us not just that we were in the Lord's arming,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
although that's important to know that you're in the Lord's army.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
How do you get enlisted in the army?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Well, you trust Christ as your Savior

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and you become a soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ and his army.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But here he says as a good soldier, not just being content with being a soldier,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but having that ambition, that desire that I would be a good soldier.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It says in verse number 2, Thou therefore endure hardness.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
That first characteristic that we looked at last week as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Notice in verse number 4, the Bible says this,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm thankful that God has determined as we get saved

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that he's chosen us to be part of his army.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
He's chosen us to be a soldier in the Lord's army.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We find here in verse number 4 that the Bible says,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
No man that warreth, those that are the soldiers in the Lord's army,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
entangleth himself with the affairs of this life.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
How many of you have found that there are affairs of this life?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Amen.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
How many of you have found that sometimes you can get entangled with the affairs of this life?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And so here we find that Paul says to Timothy,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
not only should a soldier, one that has that desire to be a good soldier,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
not only will they endure hardness,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but I have summarized the thought in verse number 4

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
as the second characteristic that a good soldier will avoid distractions.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
A good soldier will avoid distractions.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
As we get a look at this portion of Scripture and look again at the admonition

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that the Apostle Paul is giving to his son in the faith,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of course, Paul knows that he would soon face a martyr's death.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The time of his departure is at hand.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He says it plainly in the fourth chapter of this letter.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we find that the Apostle Paul, seeking to pass that baton to the next generation,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but also to give him words of encouragement to challenge him,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Timothy, in his walk with the Lord, knowing that he's there in Ephesus

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and he has the responsibility to war a good warfare,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to be involved in the work that God had called him to be,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that God had enlisted him to do.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ said this in John 17.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
He said a lot of things, but one of the truths that we get

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
as we understand the portion of Scriptures he's praying there

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
is he reveals to us that we're in the world, but we're not of the world.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the reality is that we live in this world and there are affairs of this life,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
but we need to be careful that we do not get entangled with the affairs of this life.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We're going to look at this passage of Scripture and dealing with the idea of avoiding distractions.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The word distraction is an interesting word.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It means confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and calling the attention different ways.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
That's what a distraction is.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It is confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and calling the attention different ways.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You know, it's so easy to be distracted.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So easy to be distracted.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You can walk through that back door right now and half of you would be distracted.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Guaranteed.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I see it every week.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I have a different vantage point.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I get to see when somebody walks in, when somebody coughs,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
when somebody opens a piece of candy.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Amen.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You open that mint.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
How many of you ever tried to open a mint and you think it's,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
if I just go real slow, they won't hear it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
No, no, no, we hear it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Amen.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's just better to just get it open and get it in.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Amen.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And you understand what I'm saying.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
That's why it's a distraction.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We know what distractions are.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
This morning, if you're taking notes, I want to give you point number one,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
understanding distractions and just really kind of laying the groundwork, if you will,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
as we dig into the portion of Scripture and really consider this idea of not being entangled with the affairs of this life.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I know that each of us, if we were to answer honestly this morning,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
there's been a time in our life that we've been distracted.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
There's been a time in our life where we've not had, you hear somebody say this,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I want to have your undivided attention.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You ever heard that terminology?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Why are they saying that?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Well, because they want to make sure that you're focused on what they're going to say,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
because they think what they're going to say is important and probably it will be.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It's some piece of instruction that we may need.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And so he says, give me your undivided attention.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The individual might say that because they know about distractions.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Have you ever observed somebody else being distracted?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We know that we've been distracted.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Have you ever seen somebody else be distracted?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
How many of you see people on the road all the time distracted?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Come on.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Amen.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They got that phone out.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Right.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And that phone can become a distraction.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Right.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
What are they supposed to be doing?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
They're supposed to be looking at where they're driving.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Amen.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You ever try to, you're trying to, this morning, Lauren was pouring coffee and I said, good morning, Lauren.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And she started to look over.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I said, don't look because you're going to spill the coffee.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Right.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So we understand.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We understand the mistake of saying good morning as she's in the middle of pouring or pouring the pot of coffee.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And we understand.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Listen, if I'm to be going in this direction, but there's a distraction over here in front of me here, then I don't have my attention where it needs to be.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We have observed people that are distracted in a certain sense.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
When we talk about this idea of understanding distractions in a certain sense, distractions are part of life.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It's something that we have to deal with.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We have to be aware of.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We have to understand them.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We have to know that distractions abound.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We have to know that distractions are varied.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Not everything that distracts me is going to distract you and vice versa.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And so we understand this morning that distractions are part of life.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
However, as we begin to understand the portion of Scripture that is given to us here with regard to being a good soldier,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.000
we must understand that our enemy desires, he seeks to distract us from that which is most important.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I believe that the enemy is perfectly content keeping us busy in all sorts of things that are not the most important thing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
He's perfectly content.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Not everything that's a distraction is a sin.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.480
in of itself, but if it pulls me away from what I'm supposed to be doing for

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.560
the Lord, we find that it becomes sinful. Spiritually speaking, we cannot afford to

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.420
be distracted. Spiritually speaking, we cannot afford to be distracted. But can I

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.879
tell you, the church as a whole, I'm not talking specifically about Fellowship

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:26.360
Baptist Church, but I'm talking about the church as a whole, which would include

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.159
Fellowship Baptist Church, the church as a whole has gone through a number of

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:34.639
decades being distracted. We've been distracted. There are things that

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:39.279
distract us. You know, it's amazing to me, I shared this with someone last week, it's

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:43.240
amazing to me how it's so easy, actually it was two weeks ago because I preached

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.200
on Wednesday night, that we ought to proclaim the gospel two Wednesday nights

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.919
ago, and it's amazing to me how we understand that that great commission

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:55.959
that was given to us is our responsibility. God's last command is our

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:59.720
first order of business, that we ought to be telling the world that Jesus saves

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.760
and how wonderful it is to proclaim that wonderful message. It's amazing to me how

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:13.040
many Christians today have a voice or they have a cause that is not preaching

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.680
the gospel. They have a cause that is not preaching the gospel. They can stand up

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.760
and they can speak on a whole host of subjects and a whole variety of things,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.919
and they can picket and they can this and they can protest and so on and so

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:32.760
forth, but we're not proclaiming the gospel. And the reality is that the enemy

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.360
is perfectly content. He desires that we would be distracted, and we find that the

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.879
distractions, we must understand those distractions, the cost is too high.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:47.559
Wasted time and wasted opportunities, the cost is too high. Somebody said this, we

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:53.639
can no longer afford to be asleep at the wheel. No doubt that's what's happened

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.519
in many, many areas of the church in America today. We've become distracted.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.480
We've gotten our eyes, we've been pulled in so many different directions.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.959
There's this multiplicity of objects that are crowding our mind and vying for our

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:11.479
attention, and we're being torn in different ways that we're not focused upon

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:16.800
what we must be focused on. Listen, a distracted soldier is a problem.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.559
Do you know the enemy? I've never been in the military. I've been around the military

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:24.800
all of my life, but I've never actually served in the military, so I cannot say

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.039
this from a personal experience, but just simply from study and learning from other

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:34.639
folks. But you know many times the enemy will seek to distract the soldier so that

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:38.559
they can have an opportunity for a surprise attack. There are many ways in

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:43.039
which they'll distract. There are many ways in which they'll send maybe something

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:46.960
over here to be a distraction because really the assault or the attack is going

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.199
to come from this front, but they're simply seeking to give this distraction

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:57.080
over here. Why? To get the attention of the army in this direction while

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.000
something is actually taking place over here. We find that even in the Bible, we

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.839
find that there are times in which the enemy is using various distractions with

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:12.559
regard to what's taking place in military combat, with regard to the

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:16.600
nation of Israel and other people groups in the Old Testament. We see that. We

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.679
understand that. I find that as I played sports a lot as a child growing up and

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:26.320
playing sports, there'd be times in which you'd have a distraction over here so

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.039
that the defense would have their attention over here while actually

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:35.600
something is taking place over here. We see it in life. We're aware of how this

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.880
works, but we must understand distractions from a spiritual

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.360
perspective and understand this morning that we have an enemy that desires to

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.839
distract us, to distract us. We understand distractions, but then we must,

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:55.960
number two, identify distractions. We find that the Bible says in verse number four,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.000
no man that woreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life. I

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.360
mentioned this last week that in the second chapter of the book of 2nd

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.600
Timothy, I believe these five characteristics are provided to us and

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.080
then they're explained. They're giving illustration as you study through the

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.759
text of Scripture. I'd like for you, as we consider this particular

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:20.519
characteristic of avoiding distractions or not being entangled with the affairs

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:25.160
of this life, to focus your attention back down to verse number 14. Notice what

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.720
the Bible says in verses 14 through 19. I'll read and then I'll make some

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.880
statements with regard to how we must identify distractions. The Bible says in

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.440
verse 14, of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.679
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:48.600
hearers. And so we know that in verse number 14, one of the responsibilities

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.600
that Timothy is given is what? To put them in remembrance. We find that in

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.000
verse number 14. We will note that, in fact, actually we noted that back in

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.200
1st Timothy with regard to being a good minister of Jesus Christ. In 1st

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.079
Timothy 4 and verse 6, if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.880
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.920
faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. And so here we find

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.200
that he says in verse 14, of these things put them in remembrance. He gives a

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.679
charge, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:33.040
profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. We're mindful of the fact that

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.640
in the first letter that Paul writes to Timothy, he tells him in the first

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.839
chapter about those that would use vain jangling or useless talk. Notice in

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:48.440
verse 15, the Bible says, study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.679
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:57.959
profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness, and their

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:04.040
word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, who concerning

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.320
the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.359
overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless, the foundation of God

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:17.239
standeth sure, having the seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let every

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:23.279
one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. So we noted in verse

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:27.839
number 14 that there was this responsibility, there was this task that

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:33.000
was assigned, if you will, that he is to put the brethren in remembrance, that he

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.279
is to encourage them not to strive them outwards to no profit, which are going to

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:42.559
be to the subverting of the hearers. We find in verse 15 the task is provided.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:49.440
What is Timothy to do? Study. Study to show thyself approved unto God. Why? It

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:56.679
says this, not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. You know, it's

00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:02.640
easy to be distracted when you're studying. I'm serious. You know where it's

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.679
real easy to be distracted to is when you're praying. You ever pray and get

00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:12.200
distracted? If you say no, I need to talk to you. I'm serious. I need to find out

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.920
your secret, because it's easy to get distracted when we're praying. It's easy

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.239
to get distracted when we're studying. It says study to show thyself approved

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:26.640
unto God. A workman is not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the the word of truth.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.920
Notice verse 16, but shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase in

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.920
the more ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.000
Hymenaeus and Philetus. Now notice in verse 14 and verse 16, he talks about

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.640
these words to no profit. In verse 14 and verse number 16, he talks

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.959
about these profane and vain babblings that will increase in the more

00:17:47.959 --> 00:17:51.640
ungodliness. You know, there are times in which somebody will pretend to have a

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.359
question to just distract you. You say, but I'm answering a spiritual thing. Be

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:00.959
careful that it's not a distraction. You know, the Bible says so many

00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:05.799
people talk about this being a contradiction. In fact, the Bible says in

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:10.160
Proverbs, and it's kind of a funny situation, where they talk about this

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.559
being a distraction, where the Bible says, answer a fool. Then he says, answer not a

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:19.640
fool. Back-to-back verses. And people, those that are critics of the Bible, say,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.000
oh look, there's a contradiction. The Bible says, answer a fool, and then it

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.200
says, answer not a fool. You need to know when to answer and when not to answer. You

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.840
need to have wisdom. There are times in which you need to answer a fool according

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.440
to his own folly, but there are other times that you don't need to answer a

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.719
fool. Why? Because you don't need to be distracted with that foolishness. That

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:44.320
requires a high level of discernment. It requires a high level of wisdom. It

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.919
requires that we're dependent upon the Lord Jesus Christ and that we're walking

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:54.320
in the Spirit. And so we find here that Paul, as he's giving this instruction, we

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.919
find the task in verse 14, and again in verse number 15, but we find that there

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:02.799
could be distractions. I remember while I was in Bible college, and I hope that

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:08.599
you don't think this is a poor thing of my fellow classmates, but I remember

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:12.159
while we're in Bible college, there were certain days, and maybe you've had days

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:16.239
as well, where you just say, you know what, I don't feel up to the task today. I

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:21.280
really don't think I'm ready for whatever is on hand, on tap today for the

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.520
lesson, or so on and so forth, and every once in a while we knew which professors

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.280
you could distract, and every once in a while somebody would ask a question to

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.520
start the class to just totally get the subject on something else. And they would

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.960
do that on purpose. Why? Because they didn't want to deal with the subject

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.679
that was at hand, and they kind of wanted to have an easy class, an easy day, if you

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:46.520
will, and I always thought that was an odd situation, but it happened

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.359
occasionally, especially with one in particular professor, because he was

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:56.159
easily distracted. It was very easy to get him off course and go on tangents

00:19:56.159 --> 00:20:01.960
and what-have-you, but we find here that Paul, as he's saying to Timothy, listen...

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.560
be careful, there are false teachers,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.180
we've already dealt with that in the first book,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.400
all of these things that are going on in Ephesus,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.280
but be careful not to be distracted

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.040
from teaching the brethren

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.840
and putting the brethren in remembrance

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.440
and studying yourself.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.160
We find that he mentions about these in particular

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.480
by name in verse 17 about their word,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.800
hymenaeus and phyletus.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.440
Notice he says, will eat as doth a canker.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.040
And he says in verse 18,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.920
who concerning the truth have erred

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.760
and so we need to know the truth,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.040
we need to be grounded and settled in the truth,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.240
we need to be students of the word

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.320
and then notice what it says, they've erred

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.440
and then it says saying that the resurrection

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.800
has passed already.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.760
So the specifics with regard to their error is mentioned

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.160
and then it says and overthrow the faith of some,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.000
the impact of that situation.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.440
And so we find that we need to be careful

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.360
of those that will seek to have these conversations

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.040
and these distractions and they sometimes is given here,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.680
these that are mentioned by name

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.040
that they have erred from the truth

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.040
and they're really those that have these words

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.000
to no profit, those that are these profane

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.600
and vain babblings and they increase to more ungodliness

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.200
and we find that here as Timothy has the responsibility

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.480
to be able to minister effectively,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.560
to be able to be the pastor at the church at Ephesus

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.160
that God has called him to be,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.280
he has to be aware of the fact that no man as a good soldier,

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.600
no man that worth entangle with himself

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.440
with the affairs of this life

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.280
and let me help you understand

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.320
as we go through the text of scripture

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.800
that Paul says to Timothy,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.320
here are some of your responsibilities, the tasks

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.840
and here's what you need to be aware of,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.600
here's the distractions that you need to be aware of.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.480
Now in your life and in my life,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.860
as I mentioned a moment ago, distractions will vary.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.780
Not everything that distracts you distracts me,

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.740
not everything that distracts your spouse distracts you,

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.260
not everything that distracts your children distracts you,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.020
we understand that.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.880
There are things that distract us

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.900
and not everything is going to be the same

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.860
but here's what we need to be mindful of,

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.580
we need to as we identify,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.580
we talked about understanding distractions

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.820
and we understand the way the enemy is working

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.620
but then we need to identify distractions.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.420
How do I identify distractions in my life?

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.020
Well, it requires some inspection,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.300
it requires let a man examine himself,

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.660
it requires some honesty and some humility

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.460
that we would analyze our lives,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.780
that we would examine our lives

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.480
and we would answer truthfully and honestly,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.180
what is it that's distracting me

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.000
from what God has called me to do?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.380
What is it that's a distraction?

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.320
They said that this song,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.880
that they sang this morning

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.240
and what a wonderful song it was,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.240
you alone are my heart's desire

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.360
but you know there's a lot of things

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.360
that are gonna try to distract with that stated goal.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.080
I thought about the kids,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.680
Natalie and Zachary and Ari singing,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.960
not that I wasn't thinking of Pierre and Kimberly singing

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.440
but I thought about the kids and how they,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.640
my prayer for the young people in our church regularly

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.480
is that they would be saved at a young age

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.420
and then they would grow up to serve the Lord

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.200
all the days of their lives.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.760
As they sang that song,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.080
my prayer and my thought for Natalie and Zachary

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.440
and for Ari is that truly their heart's one desire

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.760
would be the Lord Jesus Christ and living for him

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.240
but I know and you know

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.720
that there's gonna be a lot of things

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.840
in those kids' lives that are gonna try to distract them

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.760
from fulfilling that stated goal.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.980
Am I not right?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.700
And it's true in your life as well.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.000
It's true for Pierre and Kimberly.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.880
Listen, just because they're adults,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.000
the youngest in our presence this morning

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.580
up to the very oldest in our presence this morning,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.820
the enemy still wants to distract you

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.560
regardless of your age.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.400
The enemy wants to distract you

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.560
from doing what God wants for you to do

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.540
and so we must acknowledge this morning

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.440
this truth of what are the distractions.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.000
We must identify these distractions in our lives.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.840
Why?

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.800
Because we want to live a life of obedience

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.040
to the word of God that brings honor and glory

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.840
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.800
I'm gonna be a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.940
and so we must identify distractions.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.200
It's important that we have in our lives

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.720
a time of examination that we say,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.640
what is it that distracts me?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.400
Can you be honest and can you be humble

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.800
and go through that process

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.440
because I guarantee you this morning

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.140
that for every single one of us,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.500
there are things that distract us

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.140
and we're never going to be able to avoid those

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.780
as we're gonna get to in just a moment

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.720
if we don't identify them.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.880
It's gonna go a long way to helping us avoid them

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.800
if we can take the step of identifying them.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.140
Can I tell you this morning,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.340
it takes that level of humility.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.300
It requires that we would take and examine

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.020
and take the time to be able to identify why.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.780
That's why I can root them out so that I can be,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.100
listen, have you ever been in a situation

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.900
where you say, I'm not gonna get distracted.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.620
It's not just self-will power.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.740
I'm not gonna let it distract me.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.580
I'm not gonna let it distract.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.860
It's already distracted you.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.340
Am I right?

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.740
If you're sitting there saying,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.180
I'm not gonna let that thing distract me,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.340
I'm not gonna let that thing,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.820
it distracted you because you know what's on your mind?

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.300
I'm not gonna let it distract me.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.860
It did.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.940
It's already done.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.860
So we have to go through this process of examination.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.180
What is it that distracts us?

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.060
A lot of things.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.980
I don't even have a list.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980
I didn't provide a list.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.380
I'm not gonna go through a list.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.220
Why?

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.620
Because they vary for all of us.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.660
And really what I want you to do

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.780
is in your time this afternoon and this week,

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.420
I wanna encourage you to identify

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.900
the distractions in your life.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.060
You know the easiest way to identify the distractions

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.380
is when you're in a situation where you're distracted.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.340
The easiest way to identify distractions

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.140
is when you're going through life and you get distracted.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.620
You say, hmm, that's something that distracts me.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.620
I mentioned this, I wrote a little article.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.780
We used to have a Fellowship Baptist Church newsletter

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.340
that we'd put out once a month,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.420
and we'd have that,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.220
and I put a little article in there several years ago,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.060
and I titled the article Unplugged,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.420
and how important it is to disconnect, and why?

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.980
Because my phone can be a distraction,

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.380
and I know that your phone can be a distraction.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.380
I'm not talking about distracting you when you're driving.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.020
I'm talking about distracting you when you're reading,

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.920
when you're talking, when you're having family time,

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.320
when you're, you fill in the blank.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.220
Your phone can be a distraction.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.260
I keep my phone on silent 24-7.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.040
I never turn my phone off.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.220
I keep it on silent all the time.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.640
I don't turn it off because somebody might need me

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.500
in some weird hour because some medical or some whatever,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.740
and so I keep it on, but I keep it on vibrate.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.580
Why?

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.180
Because I don't want the ding or the whatever,

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.460
not even vibrate, just silent,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.980
because if it's on vibrate, it still sits there

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.620
and goes, zzz, zzz, right?

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.500
It's still a distraction, so I can have it on silent,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.900
but I have a watch that tells me when it's,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.820
so sometimes I gotta take the watch off.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.660
Why?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.980
Because I don't want to be distracted.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.340
Need to have some focused time.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.780
I don't want to be distracted.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.420
I asked the Sunday school class this morning

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.980
how many of you have gone out to a restaurant before

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.940
and you've seen the entire family sitting at the table

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.540
on a device?

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.660
See it all the time, all the time.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.300
Did you hear me?

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.900
You ever hear somebody say that?

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.780
I heard you.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.780
Okay, well, what did I say?

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.980
Oh, now you're in trouble, right?

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:01.820
Why?

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.300
Because you were distracted and they knew it.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.600
They knew you were distracted.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.140
Listen, the enemy doesn't care, ultimately.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.180
He doesn't care so much about what it is that distracts us,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.860
just so much as we're distracted.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.540
They don't really care what it is.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.820
Politics can distract you.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.660
Come on.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.260
Come on.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.640
I know we live in a very political era.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.220
By the way, it's been a soapbox

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.820
that a lot of believers have gotten on

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.780
and they've not spoken as much about the gospel

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.340
as they have about politics.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.740
I would say this, I said this to somebody on Tuesday,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.420
somebody that was here doing some work at the church.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.780
They asked me about politics and I said,

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.820
you know, I think politics is the new religion in America.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.660
It really is.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.740
It's become a religion in America.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.980
Terrible, terrible.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.140
Why don't we talk about the Bible?

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.420
Let's talk about what the Bible says.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.660
What are the Bible issues?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.340
The Bible speaks about life.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.740
We ought to know what it says about life.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.960
The Bible talks about gender.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.500
We ought to know what it says about gender.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.100
The Bible talks about race.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.679
We ought to know we're all, listen, there's one race.

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:10.200
It's the human race.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.460
The Bible talks about all these things,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.320
but what our world has done is they've made them

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.880
political things to divide.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.240
We find this morning that there are things

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.240
that can distract us.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.860
We get so caught up in these things

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.320
and these areas of focus that we get distracted

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.020
for understanding why we're even here.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.500
Why did God leave us here?

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.220
Did he leave us here for some political movement?

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.059
No.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.100
No, he left us here to preach the gospel

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.420
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.500
Amen?

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.179
That's what he left us here for.

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:53.020
And we find that the enemy, he wants to distract you.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.740
He wants to distract me.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.780
He'll use all sorts of means, and I encourage you,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.540
as we look at the text of Scripture,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.100
no man that woreth entangleth himself.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:08.220
with the affairs of this life. When we look at this idea of distractions, we must first

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:14.360
understand them and understand how they work. Have you ever tried to distract somebody?

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.200
I'm sure many of you have. You've tried to distract somebody. And you know when you were

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.780
successful at distracting them, you've been distracted. We understand them. We have to

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:31.820
identify them in your life. Identify what distracts you. And then I would say number

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:38.140
three this morning, we must avoid distractions. How can I avoid becoming distracted? How can

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:46.140
I avoid living a life really focused on something other than what the main goal should be? The

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.160
goal of every believer we find here in the text of Scripture, the Bible says that he

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.620
may please him who has chosen to be a soldier, which is going to be a message for a future

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.400
week, but we find that we are soldiers in the Lord's army. He says in verse 3, a good

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.280
soldier of Jesus Christ. How is it, what is it that should be the goal of every believer?

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:12.540
A life lived, I mentioned this a moment ago, in obedience to the Word of God that brings

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:21.060
honor and glory to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That ought to be your stated goal.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.280
It's not just the goal of the pastor. It's not just the goal of the deacon. It's not

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.920
just the goal of the Sunday school teacher or the, whomever it might be. No, it ought

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.380
to be the goal of every child of God that we understand that we're a soldier in the

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.860
Lord's army. I want to be a good soldier. I want to please him that calls me, that has

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:44.340
called me to be a soldier, and I want to live a life of obedience to his Word so that he

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:50.900
alone would receive the honor and glory that is due unto his name. But along that, along

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.400
life, even if we have that stated goal, there's going to be distractions that come. There

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.560
are going to be distractions that abound. And we say, how do we avoid those distractions?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.600
What is it that we can do in order that we might avoid those distractions? How is it

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.320
that we can remain focused on the goal that is set before us? Remember, we talked about

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.840
last week looking at the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ in Hebrews chapter 12, but we

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.840
notice that the Bible says, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. We begin

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.920
to think about a race, and the race, the goal of the one running the race is to finish.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.320
They have to have their eye on the goal, on the finish line. If they're looking elsewhere,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.840
they're not going to end up where they need to end up. They don't need to be distracted.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:41.000
I've read a number of times over the years where runners have given testimony about leading

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
the pack and coming close to the finish line and being distracted by somebody either in

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.280
the crowd or by how close the person is behind them, and they've lost the race because they

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.040
got distracted for just that long. Listen, this morning we're running a race. We need

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.280
to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. But I want you to look

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.480
at, just for a moment, the example of the Apostle Paul. Turn back to Acts chapter 20,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.360
if you will. So often we use the example of the Apostle Paul because God gives us so much

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.240
in his word about the Apostle Paul, and we have the opportunity to read of his life and

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.920
his ministry and his missionary journeys. We have the opportunity to be able to see

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.040
about his interactions with other believers and his example, his teaching, so on and so

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.300
forth. And so I look in Acts chapter 20, and I think about this passage often as we're

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.120
teaching and preaching through 1 and 2 Timothy because this particular passage in Acts chapter

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:44.880
number 20 is actually spoken to the church leaders at Ephesus. He called for them, according

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.400
to verse number 16 and 17, verse 17, he called the elders of the church, those pastors, the

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.680
leaders of the church to come, and he's going to have this conversation with them. And in

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:02.560
the midst of the interaction, we find great truth that is given to us with regard to the

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:09.680
Apostle Paul in his own personal life, avoiding distractions and seeking to be focused on

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:17.080
the goal of pleasing the Lord. Notice in verse 24, I do not have time to read the entirety

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:22.080
of this passage with regard to the entirety of the message, but notice Paul says this,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.160
but none of these things move me. Now just pause there just for a moment. Paul's going

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:32.280
to mention about a course that he's running and finishing a course, and again we use the

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:37.640
analogy as we see that Paul uses often of a race, and we find that God has given us

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.640
that picture, that analogy, so that we can understand. And he says, none of these things

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:46.520
move me. There are things that you can find here within the text of Scripture where he

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.600
talks about how that he did not know what he would face when he would go to Jerusalem

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.680
at the end of verse 22, not knowing the things that shall befall me there. And we find that

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.840
there are bonds, he talks about in verse 23, and afflictions abide me. The Apostle Paul

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.480
knew what it was to suffer. He knew what it was to deal with all of these things, and

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:14.560
he says, none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself. Now think

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.920
about these two phrases. He says, none of these things move me. I'm not going to be

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:24.240
moved to change the course of my direction by any of these things. The things that are

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.080
unknown, according to verse 22, I don't know what's going to befall me, or the things that

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:35.560
are known, in verse number 22, sorry, the things that shall befall me, he doesn't know

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.800
verse number 23, the bonds and the afflictions that abide him, so he's not going to allow

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.480
the known or the unknown. Now think about that just for a moment. Paul knew some things,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.080
but then he didn't know some things, and he said, none of those things are going to move

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.680
me. You know, sometimes we're moved by things that we know, or even things that we don't

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.520
know. People, somebody said this, you know, it's amazing to me, everything that I worry

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.920
about, it never comes to pass, as if worry caused it not to happen. No, the fact of the

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.360
matter is that we worry about a lot of unknown things. We worry about a lot of things that

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.920
might could happen, and they just never happen. And somebody said this about worry, it's like

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.600
a rocking chair to keep you busy, but it won't get you anywhere. And God said, be careful

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:21.420
for nothing, amen? But in everything we're to do, we're to pray, we're to seek the face

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.000
of God with thanksgiving, understanding that he knows all things. But Paul says, I'm not

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.680
going to let the things that I don't know, and I'm not going to let the things that I

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.480
do know, I'm not going to let them move me. Wow, praise the Lord. You know, there's some

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.760
things in life that you don't know. And by the way, I would tell you, you should be glad

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:47.760
that you don't know. One of the kings of Israel, his name was Saul, and he didn't know what

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.960
was going to happen in battle. Samuel had died. Saul was a wreck. He'd abolished all

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.520
the soothsayers in the land, but he said, find me a soothsayer, because I want to find

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.000
Samuel and I want to see what's going on. And then he found out that he was going to

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000
die in battle. It would have been better if he didn't know what was going to happen. But

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.920
he found out he was going to die in battle, and he was frozen. He couldn't do anything,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:20.640
he was frozen. Just freeze up, why? Because of the now what he knew. Obviously, we know

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:27.600
that he goes on, and sure enough, he dies in battle. We find here, there's some things

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:33.200
that we don't know. You know, so often people are so concerned about the unknown, and they're

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.400
not doing what we know that we're supposed to be doing. They're distracted by the unknown.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.920
They're distracted about things that God hasn't revealed to us. They're distracted about,

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.120
I want to know this, and I want to know that. Now listen, there are certain things that

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:53.080
God has told us, and there are certain things that God hasn't told us. And God knows best,

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.440
and God's way is always best, and whatever it is that he's chosen not to tell us, we

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.260
just leave it as that's an unknown, and it's not for me to be concerned about, and it should

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:05.200
not distract me. Amen? Paul said, I'm not going to worry. I'm not going to, the things

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.120
that I know, the bonds and afflictions, but the things that I don't know, they're not

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.320
going to move me, but none of these things move me. Notice he says, neither count I my

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.520
life dear unto myself. Somebody said this, they offered in Sunday school class this morning

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:26.920
in our marriage class, that there's a problem with the me-centered approach, being so centered

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.480
on self. Certainly in our society, we see that all around. But Paul says, neither count

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.360
I my life dear unto myself. How could he say that? Because he said, I am crucified with

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.000
Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
live in the flesh, I live by the power of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.040
for me. Hallelujah. He said, I die daily. He has the understanding, Paul does, that

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.160
he's bought with a price, and he's going to glorify God in his body. Why? Because he's

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.440
not his own. And he says, I don't count my life dear unto myself. I'm not going to worry

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.360
about all those things, but here's what I'm concerned with, so that I, notice in verse

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:16.700
24, might finish my course with joy. Paul had a goal in life, and that was to finish

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:23.720
his course with joy. Paul had this stated objective, if you will, that I want to finish,

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.820
but I don't want to just barely get across the finish line. I want to finish my course

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.600
with joy. Can I tell you this morning, it's not going to happen on accident. It's not

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.520
going to happen by chance. And can I tell you this morning, that that course is going

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.720
to be lined with distractions. Going to be lined with distractions. And so Paul says,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.960
I'm not going to let these things move me. I don't count my life dear unto myself. Why?

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.640
Because I want to finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:58.480
the Lord Jesus Christ, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. Paul understood that

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.200
he had been called by God. Paul understood that he had a responsibility before the Lord.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.880
and he desired to finish with joy

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.880
what God had called him to do.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.700
I believe that Paul was regularly aware of the fact

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.320
that one day he would stand before the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.840
Why do I believe that he was aware of that?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.480
Because he taught it.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.960
He taught it to the believers that he's ministering to.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.080
He's warning every man, why?

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.880
So that they might be able to present them

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.920
perfect or complete in Christ,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.440
and that's the ministry of Paul.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.780
He's regularly aware personally

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.120
that he would stand before the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.900
and he desired, I wanna finish.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.620
I don't wanna be entangled with the affairs of this life.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.500
I wanna avoid those distractions.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.340
Why?

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.500
Because I wanna finish my course with joy.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.340
I wanna be able to stand before God,

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.320
and I wanna hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.620
I want God to be pleased with my life

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.020
to know that I finished what he gave me to do.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.540
You say, well, God didn't call me to the ministry

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.400
like he called Paul.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.700
God called you to service.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.020
God has a plan for every one of his people.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.580
God has a plan for every one of his people.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.560
For some, it is full-time ministry.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.700
It is being a pastor and evangelist,

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.000
a missionary, so on and so forth,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.620
but the reality is that that call, we understand,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.920
is not for every single child of God,

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.240
but every single child of God

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.840
has been called to be a soldier,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.220
and to be a good soldier, to be a good soldier.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.660
In the Marine Corps, they called it duty,

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.160
and that's when a particular Marine

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.000
was to be on duty, on guard, on watch.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.880
The Navy, I have found, at least as far as Evan is concerned,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.880
they call it watch.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.400
I remember Juliana saying, Evan has watch.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.360
Has watch, well, I wasn't familiar with the term initially

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.920
because I always heard from my dad, being a Marine,

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.360
that it was always duty.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.160
I'm not sure what every branch

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.960
of the armed forces would refer to it,

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.820
but we understand the idea that there's some people

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.420
that are on guard, that are on duty,

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.820
they're on watch, they have a responsibility,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.260
and those that are supposed to be watched for

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.340
are counting on their watchers,

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.400
if I could use that term, not being distracted.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.900
Does that make sense this morning?

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.260
Because if they're distracted, if the one on watch,

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.840
if the one on duty, if the one on guard is distracted,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.400
then guess what happens to the whole?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.720
They become vulnerable.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.400
They become vulnerable.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.240
This morning, can I talk to the dads, the husbands?

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.360
The enemy wants to distract you

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.520
because your family becomes vulnerable.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.300
If you're distracted from fulfilling your role

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.880
as a husband and as a father,

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.640
your family becomes vulnerable.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.280
To the moms, to the wives,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.920
if you're distracted, you become vulnerable.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.960
You say, man, I'm glad I'm not a dad, I'm not a mom.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.320
Maybe you will be one day.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.700
To the pastor, that's me.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.220
The flock is vulnerable if I'm distracted.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.220
The Bible tells me, as a pastor,

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.020
that I watch for your souls.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.880
That's just one of many responsibilities

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.000
that the pastor has, but how weighty of a responsibility.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.840
The people of God can no longer be asleep at the wheel.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.520
We cannot afford to be distracted.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.240
If we wanna be a good soldier,

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.520
a good soldier endures hardness,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.320
but a good soldier avoids distractions.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.140
If a soldier was found asleep while they're on watch,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.580
there were some high stakes.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.420
In fact, we find that the Philippian jailer,

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.780
he was ready to kill himself

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.380
because of the fact that he thought

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.940
that those that were incarcerated were free.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.900
We find that Herod was ready to kill,

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.480
gave execution orders, why?

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.640
Because of the fact that Peter was released from prison.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.279
The Bible says that he commanded in verse number 19

00:44:28.279 --> 00:44:31.080
that they should be put to death.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.480
Why?

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.920
Because he assumed they were sleeping.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.320
He missed the whole miracle part of God delivering Peter.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.460
There were high stakes, high responsibility.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.400
Can I tell you this morning

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.360
that we're soldiers in the Lord's army?

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.020
We ought to desire to be a good soldier.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.600
We have to avoid distractions.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.900
The distractions abound.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.860
Notice what Paul says.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.220
I'll close with this in 1 Corinthians 9.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.000
In 1 Corinthians 9, the apostle Paul says,

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.700
in verse 23,

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.700
and this I do for the gospel's sake,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.320
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.880
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.240
but one receiveth the prize?

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.440
So run, notice that ye may obtain.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.520
And every man that striveth for the mastery

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.520
is temperate in all things.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.360
That's that level of self-control.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.840
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.460
but we, an incorruptible.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.620
He's using an analogy here of the games

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.900
that they would be aware of,

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.980
and we think about Olympic games and what have you

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.420
and the understanding of those that are running a race,

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.300
those that are competing

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.380
in a particular field of competition,

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.820
how that they're competing with the goal of winning.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.500
They, however, are going to receive a corruptible crown,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.059
but we, an incorruptible.

00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:06.779
And I want you to think about the way

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.120
in which these that run,

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.080
that they participate in whatever it is

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.020
the particular discipline is,

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.420
that they have that goal that they're running

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.860
so that they could obtain,

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.360
that they want to have that prize,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.820
and there's a lot of training that has to take place.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.880
You know, there are many people

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.360
that have given testimony of being Olympic gold medalists

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.700
that have talked about not taking any days off,

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.240
not being distracted to eat something

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.080
that would not be good for them

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.980
with regard to their ability to compete,

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.059
not being involved in an activity

00:46:40.059 --> 00:46:41.980
that would hinder their ability to compete,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.820
so on and so forth.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.500
And Paul says, I therefore, in verse number 26,

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.180
so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I,

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.600
not as one that beateth the air,

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.100
but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.180
lest that by any means when I have preached to others,

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.380
I myself should be a castaway,

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.900
to be useless or of no value.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.080
He says, no, I want my life to count for Christ.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.000
I want to be a good soldier.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.240
But there are a lot of distractions.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.160
This morning, you might already know how you're distracted.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.640
In fact, maybe someone here this morning,

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.420
maybe several would say, I'm distracted all the time.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.640
I'm just distracted.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.740
The enemy has gotten me so distracted on these other things.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.200
I don't know what they are, but you do.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.800
The Holy Spirit of God has an ability to take his finger

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.460
and touch the heart of his people.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.160
I don't know what the distractions are in your life.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.520
I know what they are in my life.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.960
And I know that we need to avoid them.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.140
I know that we need to understand how the enemy works.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.040
We need to identify them so that we can avoid them.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.720
We need to have this goal that Paul did,

00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:57.980
that I might finish my course with joy.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.340
I'm gonna stand before God one day, and so are you.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.960
I hope that brings a level of soberness, sobriety,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.320
to our minds, to our hearts,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.000
that I'm gonna stand before God one day,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.600
and I'm gonna give an account.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.200
And I don't want to stand before God and say,

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.520
I was asleep at the wheel.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.360
I don't want to stand before God and say,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.320
well, all these other things.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.160
No, there were distractions.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.040
It says, no man that woreth entangleth himself

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.400
with the affairs of this life.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.420
Oh, that God would help us to be focused

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.739
on what we should be focused on,

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:38.660
to keep our eyes on Jesus, to finish our course with joy,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.100
and to avoid the distractions.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.940
Let's pray together.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.820
Father, we love you.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.760
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.679
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation

00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:52.020
that you'd have your will and way in our lives.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.480
Lord, help us to be honest and to be humble.

00:48:56.739 --> 00:48:59.340
Help us, Lord, to confess what we need to confess

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.780
and forsake what we need to forsake.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.260
And Lord, we thank you

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.660
that you're a loving, gracious, merciful God.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.900
I pray that you'd help us, Lord,

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.980
to finish our course with joy,

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.380
that we'd keep our eyes on Jesus,

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.299
the author and finisher of our faith.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.179
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:18.460
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.059
Would you stand with me?

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:21.260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.859
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:49:23.859 --> 00:49:25.679
As she does, the altar is open.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.239
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na.

00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:31.580
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.140
Na-na-na-na-na.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.859
Um, Tiptoe.

It was, mm-hmm.
