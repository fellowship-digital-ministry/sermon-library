1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
through 1st and 2nd Timothy on Sunday mornings.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,599
Our theme is continue, but for Mother's Day,

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,119
we're gonna take a break from 1st and 2nd Timothy,

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,119
head over here to 2 Kings chapter number four this morning.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,239
Mother's Day, of course, is a special day

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:17,440
that is celebrated on this, the 2nd May annually

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,959
here in the United States of America.

8
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,959
Anna Jarvis is credited as celebrating

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:27,600
the 1st Mother's Day, and that was back on May 10th, 1908.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,319
And prior to then, there were some times

11
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,919
in which various pockets of populations

12
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,240
in the United States would celebrate

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,759
or acknowledge mothers on a special day.

14
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,080
But really, she is credited with celebrating

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,400
the 1st Mother's Day there on May 10th, 1908.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,080
It was about five years later, on May 10th, 1913,

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,259
that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution,

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,279
and that resolution, they called for all federal employees,

19
00:00:56,279 --> 00:01:00,720
government officials, to wear a white carnation.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,560
And they made that decree, or that resolution,

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,839
if you will, on May the 10th, 1913,

22
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:08,879
and they said that they were to wear the white carnation

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,839
on May 11th, 1913 in honor of Mother's Day.

24
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,639
It was the following year, on May 8th, 1914.

25
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,319
I give you all this information

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,400
just to let you know the importance of it,

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,440
but Congress passed a law designating

28
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:27,800
the second Sunday of May would be Mother's Day.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,279
In that law, they also made a request for a proclamation,

30
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:35,599
and the very next day, then President Woodrow Wilson

31
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,440
issued a proclamation declaring

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,440
the first national Mother's Day.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,959
And so that goes all the way back to 1914.

34
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,879
Of course, this is 2024, so 110 years ago

35
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,080
when it was made law.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,040
The decree, if you will, the proclamation

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,599
by President Woodrow Wilson after the law passed Congress.

38
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,400
Today, there are over 50 nations in the world

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,760
that have a day in which they have on their calendars

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,080
an observance, a special day for observing Mother's Day.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
It's not always on this same day

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,559
that we celebrate here in the United States of America.

43
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,839
There are a number of countries

44
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,559
that do have their calendar mirrored to our calendar

45
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,320
based on that proclamation,

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,880
but there are many other nations

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,360
that have some other time during the year.

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,399
But I'm thankful this morning, early this morning,

49
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,960
I sent my mom a text.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,000
Of course, not able to see her today.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They're down in South Carolina.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
I sent her a card in the mail,

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,279
and then I sent her a text this morning,

54
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,240
let her know that I love her and appreciate her

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,199
and all that she's done for me over the years.

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,520
And I am thankful for Holly,

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,679
and also let her know the appreciation that I have.

58
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,880
I hope that you, if your mother is still alive,

59
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,160
have had the opportunity to thank her today.

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,720
And if not, if you would do that,

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,880
many, no doubt, their mothers have passed on into eternity,

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,440
and that makes for a difficult day.

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,600
But the remembrance of all of those wonderful memories,

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,399
we certainly can rejoice in that

65
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,320
and thank God for the time that we're able to have.

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,839
As we come to 2 Kings chapter number four,

67
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,800
we're looking at the ministry of Elisha.

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,080
The ministry of Elisha is an exciting ministry,

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,199
one in which many of us are familiar with.

70
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,080
And as you begin the fourth chapter

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,119
of the book of 2 Kings,

72
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,479
we find that God gives us in the first seven verses,

73
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,000
it's not our text of scripture,

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,520
but God provides for us the record of the miracle

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
of the pot of oil.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
Remember the widow woman,

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,320
she had a debt and her husband had died

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
and she had two sons.

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,479
And she went to the man of God, to Elisha.

80
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,600
She said, he asked this question,

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,720
what have you, what hast thou in the house?

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,080
And she said, not anything in the house save a pot of oil.

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,039
And God did a great miracle

84
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,679
and they gathered up all the vessels

85
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,399
and they filled from that pot of oil,

86
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,679
every vessel they could possibly find.

87
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,520
Elisha gave the instruction to sell,

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
pay off the debt, live on the rest.

89
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,000
What a wonderful miracle.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,279
As we come to verse number eight,

91
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,039
the text of scripture in which we're looking at this morning

92
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,240
we are introduced to a family,

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,080
a husband and wife in the city of Shunem.

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,839
We do not know the name of this woman.

95
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:16,079
She simply introduced to us as a great woman.

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,760
In fact, often as we look at this text of scripture

97
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,399
in verses eight down through verse number 37,

98
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,399
she is often simply referred to as the Shunemite woman.

99
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,000
This morning, we'll take an opportunity to review her life

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,519
as it's revealed in this passage of scripture.

101
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,239
And I wanna note a number of characteristics

102
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,920
about this lady that would give us reason

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,920
as to why the Bible tells us that it was in this place

104
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,519
where was a great woman.

105
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,760
Notice with me in verse number eight,

106
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,119
the Bible says, and it fell on a day

107
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,720
that Elisha passed to Shunem where was a great woman

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
and she constrained him to eat bread.

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,399
And so it was that as off as he passed by,

110
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,279
he turned in thither to eat bread.

111
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,440
And she said unto her husband,

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God

113
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:13,720
which passeth by us continually.

114
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,440
And I praise God for her perception and her spirituality.

115
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,839
The Bible says that she then makes this request

116
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,920
to her husband, she says, let us make a little chamber.

117
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,399
I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed

118
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,959
and a table and a stool and a candlestick.

119
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,119
And it shall be when he cometh to us

120
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:38,480
that he shall turn in thither.

121
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,959
At this point, they have no children.

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,320
We'll go through the text of scripture

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,559
and see the miraculous birth of their son.

124
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,519
But I want you to skip down, if you will,

125
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,440
to verse number 19.

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,799
I'll give you the title for the message

127
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,720
and we'll jump into the thoughts this morning.

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,920
In verse 18, it says, and when the child was grown,

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,040
it fell on a day that he went out to his father,

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,559
to the reapers, and he said unto his father,

131
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,320
my head, my head.

132
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,239
And he said to Elad, notice this, carry him to his mother.

133
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,720
And I've titled the message this morning,

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
carry him to his mother.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,679
There's been many times in our lives

136
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,559
when our children would get injured.

137
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,839
I remember as a child, if I would get injured,

138
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,000
it was always mom that provided more care

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,839
and compassion than dad.

140
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,079
If I was injured as a child and I went to my dad,

141
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,160
he'd try to move the limb or move whatever

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
and say, it's not broken, son.

143
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,760
It moves just fine, just carry on, right?

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,880
And mom was the one that you would go to

145
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,920
to have compassion and some care and concern.

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,160
And in our home, it's the same way.

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,119
Oftentimes, I'll say, I'm not sure what to do about that.

148
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,079
Go see mom.

149
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:44,519
And here, this man says, carry him to his mother.

150
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,200
As we think about this passage of scripture,

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,079
we're gonna make our way through the entirety of it.

152
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,079
I wanna give you six thoughts this morning,

153
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,799
and I'm gonna be brief with each one.

154
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:55,279
Don't get overwhelmed with having six thoughts this morning.

155
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,940
But six thoughts this morning of characteristics

156
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,440
of this lady, this Shunammite woman,

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,239
as we refer to her as in this text of scripture,

158
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:08,239
that are great characteristics that lead to God telling us

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,239
that she is a great woman.

160
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,160
Number one, if you're taking notes,

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,500
I want you to note that she was caring.

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
She was a caring individual.

163
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,600
And I'm thankful for the care that we see

164
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
in this text of scripture.

165
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,920
The Bible says that Elisha would pass by

166
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,200
this particular place, and in verse number eight,

167
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,440
the Bible says that, so it was that as oft as he passed by,

168
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,059
he turned in thither to eat bread.

169
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:35,899
Why?

170
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,459
Because this Shunammite woman,

171
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,380
that's introduced to us in verse number eight,

172
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,019
that she constrained him to eat bread.

173
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,200
She was an individual that demonstrated care.

174
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,980
She was a caring individual.

175
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,179
In fact, Elisha says this in verse number 13.

176
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,380
Notice the Bible says, and he said unto him,

177
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,579
to Gehazi, his servant, he says to say unto her,

178
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:02,579
this Shunammite woman, behold, thou hast been careful for us

179
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,660
with all this care.

180
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,480
Begin to think about caring and being a caring individual,

181
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,739
and we find here in the passage of scripture

182
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:16,160
that no doubt the evidence is given to us

183
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
that she cared about Elisha.

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
Though the text of scripture does not tell us,

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,839
I believe that she cared for her husband.

186
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,160
As you look at verses eight through 11,

187
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
eight through 10, excuse me,

188
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,839
you find the interaction between this woman and her husband,

189
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:33,700
and I think that she had care for her husband,

190
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,059
and it then leads to having care for Elisha, the man of God,

191
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,940
and eventually would have care for her own son.

192
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,599
She has no son at the beginning of the text of scripture.

193
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:48,099
We're introduced to her as being this great woman,

194
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,419
this couple with no children,

195
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,659
but we find that Elisha makes the statement

196
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:57,099
in verse number 16 that thou shalt embrace a son.

197
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,239
We find that she did indeed have a child,

198
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,679
and that child was grown,

199
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,200
as we read already in verses 18 and 19.

200
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
We find that in verse number 20,

201
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,479
the Bible says that after the servant

202
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,900
had received the instruction to carry him to his mother,

203
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,880
after he's in the field there with his father,

204
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,580
and he says, my head, my head,

205
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,320
that it says that when he had taken him

206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,280
and brought him to his mother,

207
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,280
he sat on her knees till noon and then died.

208
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,580
It's a sad verse of scripture as it ends,

209
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,739
but I see her care for her son

210
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,780
as he would come in from the field,

211
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,219
and he's got this perhaps something,

212
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:38,080
maybe heat stroke, some other injury maybe that took place,

213
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,020
and he's cried out for his head while he's in the field,

214
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,619
and he goes to the mom.

215
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,380
The servant brings him to his mother,

216
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,900
and she, the Bible says, that he, that son,

217
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,020
was there with his mother and sat on her knees till noon.

218
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
Maybe some of you here this morning,

219
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,559
you can remember as a child receiving the care on the knees.

220
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,059
of your mother.

221
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:07,839
And the reality is that God many times, and I know this morning that this is not, the

222
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,479
statements that I'll make this morning are not necessarily statements that are applicable

223
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,139
in every case, and I understand that.

224
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:21,199
But many times God has equipped mothers to have that caring heart and to demonstrate

225
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,919
that care, and we see it here in this Shunammite woman.

226
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,479
Not only do we see that she was caring, but number two, I note that she was generous.

227
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,119
She was generous.

228
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,919
You know, in our text of scripture, we see some evidence of this, but on the bulletin

229
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,439
this morning, the Bible says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above

230
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,959
rubies from Proverbs 31 and verse number 10.

231
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,759
The only woman called virtuous throughout all of the scripture is actually Ruth.

232
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,999
You find it in the book of Ruth.

233
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:55,879
But you'll find here that as we look through Proverbs 31 with regard to generosity that

234
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,639
is described in that text of scripture, that you'll see in 2 Kings chapter number 4 a lady

235
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,519
that was generous.

236
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,239
The Bible tells us, we've noted already in verse number 8 with regard to the provision

237
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:13,360
for the man of God, that she constrained him to eat bread.

238
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,479
The Bible says, so it was that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

239
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:24,519
Now we find that the Bible tells us that he passed that way regularly, and so this was

240
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,419
not just a one-time occurrence.

241
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,879
This was a regular occurrence, and she constrained him.

242
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,199
She was generous with her resources, constrained him to eat bread, and as oft as he passed

243
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,519
by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

244
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,439
Her generosity does not stop there.

245
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:45,119
We find that as we've read in verses 9 and 10, that she has this perception.

246
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,639
She's a spiritual lady.

247
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:54,559
She has this perception, and she says to her husband, this is a holy man of God.

248
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,559
And she has this understanding of who the prophet of God is, Elisha, and notice what

249
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,879
she makes this request in verse number 10, let us make a little chamber.

250
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,239
We find that really the idea of a prophet's chamber, we refer to that still to this very

251
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,619
day of using that phraseology.

252
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:17,739
When we built the parsonage, we put in the basement a prophet's chamber area so that

253
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:22,059
those that are traveling, missionaries and evangelists, would have the opportunity to

254
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:27,899
have a place where they could stay and have some refreshment time and what have you.

255
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,779
And so we find that she makes this request with regard to putting this prophet's chamber,

256
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,080
this little chamber.

257
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:42,919
She says, let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick.

258
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:49,360
And it shall be, notice the end of the verse, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,239
thither.

260
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,239
She was generous.

261
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:56,919
It wasn't an opportunity that she was going to allow to pass by.

262
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,880
She wanted to seize the opportunity that was before her, and though there's, as we look

263
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,239
at this text of scripture, this desire to be a blessing to the man of God, we find that

264
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:14,479
because of this, it resulted in the fact that Elisha would stay there.

265
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:20,520
That Elisha, as often as he would pass through that region, as he would travel throughout

266
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,319
the land of Israel, that he would come through and he would have a place where he could rest.

267
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,679
He would have a place of provision.

268
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,599
It was because of the generosity of this woman in Shunem.

269
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,720
We find that the Bible would tell us with regard to opportunities and the reality that

270
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,880
we're to do good as we have opportunity to do so.

271
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,000
In Galatians chapter number six, hold your place there, and I want you to see what the

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,360
Bible tells us.

273
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,160
In Galatians chapter number six, God gives us instruction, and we ought to be looking

274
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
for opportunities.

275
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,399
We ought to be looking for opportunities to do good, to be generous, to be giving.

276
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,800
We find that the Bible tells us in Galatians six and verse number nine, and let us not

277
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,800
be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:24,000
Then notice verse number 10, as we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,519
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

280
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:37,119
Though Galatians six was not written at the time of the ministry of Elisha, this lady

281
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:43,160
in Shunem did not have a copy of the book of Galatians, the opportunity presented itself

282
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,760
to her, and she seized the opportunity.

283
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,200
She had the opportunity to do something for the man of God, and she goes to her husband

284
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,059
and she says, let us do this, let's be generous, let's be hospitable.

285
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,359
And what a blessing, again, as we think about the man of God, Elisha, traveling, and I want

286
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:08,679
you to understand that not only would it be a blessing to Elisha because of her generosity,

287
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,679
but understand the way in which it would return to her and her family, because why?

288
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:20,839
Well, the man of God is there, and to have the privilege of having the man of God as

289
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,399
he would travel through to be at their place, at their residence, would be a tremendous

290
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,359
blessing and opportunity.

291
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:33,559
We've had the privilege, and I know that some of you have as well, over your time of serving

292
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,320
the Lord, to have meals with servants of the Lord, to have opportunities, perhaps, to have

293
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,839
servants of the Lord stay in your home.

294
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,459
Of course, with the Prophets Chamber, we have opportunity regularly to have missionaries

295
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:51,739
and evangelists stay in our home, and the opportunities of fellowship and the opportunities

296
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:58,339
of being able to be a blessing, I mean, they just abound, and it's such a privilege and

297
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,619
such a blessing.

298
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:05,940
I remember, I think back to the opportunity when we first connected with Brother Dan Hummel,

299
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,980
and of course, you know, our church is familiar with Beacon of Truth, and we do a lot with

300
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,179
them, and we had the opportunity at this point, about 15 years ago, to first meet Brother

301
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:22,059
Hummel, and it was at our church when we were in Pennsylvania, we were members of the church,

302
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:27,820
working a full-time job, had three little kids, and two, four, and six, I mean, we understand

303
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,059
what it was to be busy and to have schedules and all over the place and what have you,

304
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:37,019
but our church had a scripture assembly ministry, and it was in the evenings, and I remember

305
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,419
Dan Hummel standing up, we'd never heard about it before, and he stood up and he tore

306
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:46,859
one of the scriptures apart and showed how it gets assembled and showed the whole process,

307
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:52,019
and he said this, he said, anybody that's here can do something with this scripture

308
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,019
assembly.

309
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,980
It was the first time our church had ever done it.

310
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,500
He said, from the youngest to the oldest, somebody can do some job during the scripture

311
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,100
assembly, and so we had three little kids, as I mentioned already, and Joseph was just

312
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,220
about two years old, just a little tot of a kid, and we thought, well, I guess he said

313
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,260
everyone can do it, and so Holly and I talked, and we said, we're gonna go, and we went.

314
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,579
We were there each night of that assembly, and our kids did serve, they got involved,

315
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,579
but God allowed us, and Holly and I had the opportunity to chat, and we were able to take

316
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,220
Brother Hummel out and his wife and the team that was with them, it was a different group,

317
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,940
it wasn't Dan and Donna Stroop, it was a different couple, and we were able to take them out

318
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,940
for dinner after one of the assemblies, and we were just able to go out to pizza, it was

319
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,260
late, of course, work and school the next morning and all those things, it was gonna

320
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,700
be a late night, but at that place, through having that opportunity, God allowed our hearts

321
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,600
to be knit together, and we had such a blessed opportunity, and now I think about all these

322
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,820
years later, and to see the blessing of that, listen, as God would give you opportunity,

323
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,339
just as God gave this lady, this Shunammite woman is referred to her as this opportunity,

324
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:11,540
she seized it, she was generous, and God blessed.

325
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,100
I want you to notice, as we continue to read, in verse number 11, it says, and it fell on

326
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:25,040
a day that he, Elisha, came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.

327
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,739
So he took advantage of the prophet's chamber that was made available as he traveled through.

328
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:36,260
The Bible says in verse number 12 that he said to Gehazi, his servant, call the Shunammite.

329
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,500
When he had called her, she stood before him.

330
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,979
Number three, if you're taking notes this morning, we notice not only that she was caring

331
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:48,719
and generous, but we notice number three, she was content.

332
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,719
She was content.

333
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,380
Notice what the Bible says.

334
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,940
She stood before him at the end of verse number 12, and in verse 13, it says that he said

335
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:04,700
unto him, so Elisha says to Gehazi, say now unto her, behold, thou hast been careful for

336
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:16,299
us with all this care, and then notice this question, what is to be done for thee?

337
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:24,419
What is thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host?

338
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:32,739
What a great opportunity that is given to her as Elisha says to Gehazi, I will speak

339
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,739
on your behalf.

340
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,640
You have been so caring for us.

341
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,659
What is it to be done for thee?

342
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:46,140
Would you like us to stand before the king and speak for you or to the captain, the host?

343
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,739
And notice her answer, I dwell among mine own people.

344
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:51,739
She was content.

345
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:52,739
She was content.

346
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,219
She said, I dwell among my own people, and he said, what then is to be done for her?

347
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,179
You see the heart of...

348
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,519
Elisha desiring to give and to be a blessing to this lady that had been so caring for him

349
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:12,119
and provided not only the bread, but also the dwelling place in that prophet's chamber.

350
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,379
And Gehazi answered in verse number 14, and he said,

351
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:21,379
Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

352
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:26,539
We find that though she was in this particular place of barrenness, that she did not seem

353
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,859
to be bitter by it.

354
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,859
She was content.

355
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,939
In fact, it says that he said, call her, and when he had called her, she stood in the door.

356
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:34,939
In verse 16, he said,

357
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:43,059
About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.

358
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,939
Can you imagine her hearing these words?

359
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:48,939
She knew, the Bible tells us already, that she said to her husband in verse number nine,

360
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:53,339
I perceive that this is an holy man of God.

361
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:59,539
His ministry is going forth and he's traveling to and fro, and no doubt as we understand

362
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:04,019
and we're familiar with the life and ministry of Elisha, there's miracles that are taking

363
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:10,739
place and we find that on that day that he's there and he says to her, she's called back

364
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:17,739
into the presence, about this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a

365
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,859
son.

366
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,919
She had no child.

367
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,959
Not only had no child, but her husband was old, according to verse number 14.

368
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,959
And she says in verse number 16, at the end of the verse,

369
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:34,799
Nay, my Lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

370
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,559
It was almost beyond her ability to believe what had just been declared because she'd

371
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,799
known the circumstances that she had dealt with, but I believe that she was content not

372
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,159
only by her answer when it was asked, what is to be done for thee, that she says, I dwell

373
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,119
among mine own people, but even in the situation there with having no children, it seems as

374
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,699
if this Sunamite woman was a content individual.

375
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:05,639
She did not serve so that she could get something.

376
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:11,759
She did not perceive that Elisha was a man of God and that Elisha was a prophet of God

377
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,439
and that we're going to be generous and we're going to have him here so that we can get

378
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:16,439
something.

379
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,239
See, that's not the motive for giving and for serving.

380
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,439
We're content in what God has given to us and the opportunities that he has given to

381
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:29,879
us and the blessings that he will allow in our lives.

382
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,199
See if our motive for serving, God knows our motives, by the way, if our motive for serving

383
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:38,439
is so that I might get something out of it, then we have a wrong motive.

384
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:43,359
We have a selfish motive and we find that God does not bless that.

385
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,339
We live in a society today, in fact, many times, though it's not publicly known because

386
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:53,000
of legal ramifications and what have you, but many people say, well, I'll do this for

387
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,479
you if you do this for me.

388
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,799
And that's the way often things work in a society.

389
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,159
But here, this Sunamite woman, she was content.

390
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,439
She did not serve so that she could get something.

391
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,439
She was content.

392
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:10,359
You know, contentment is a great thing.

393
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,599
Many people in our society today are living lives of discontentment.

394
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,959
We think of the society in which we live in and we think that if I could just have more,

395
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:25,039
if I could just have this, if I could just, then I would be content.

396
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,219
The reality is that there were surveys done at this point, they're years ago when these

397
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:35,439
surveys were done, but they surveyed a group of people across every spectrum of income

398
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,119
level.

399
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:43,000
From the lowest income level to the highest, they just went through, they started, I think,

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,759
at $25,000 a year and they went up to like $250,000 a year and just looked at that category

401
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,399
of people and that income area.

402
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:57,199
And they went through and they gave, and they said, how much more would you need to be content?

403
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:01,839
You know, it was consistent that each earner in each of those categories said, you know,

404
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,239
if I could just have $10,000 more, I'd be, I'd be okay.

405
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,879
And that's what the one in the lowest income said and the one in the $250,000 income, they

406
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,679
all said the same thing.

407
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,000
There were options for them to select and it's, it's interesting.

408
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,359
We live in a society that, that really is designed to make you discontent.

409
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,600
We live in a midst of a generation of marketing and all sorts of things that, that really

410
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,239
the enemy wants you to be discontent.

411
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:35,559
But I want you to look at Philippians chapter number four.

412
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,399
As I think about the, the Shunammite woman and I think about her contentment as we see

413
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:45,559
in this passage of Scripture, I want to encourage you this morning to be content.

414
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,639
We find that in Philippians chapter number four, Paul is writing, and many of us would

415
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:52,880
be familiar with the fact that he's writing this church in Philippi and he's writing from

416
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
prison.

417
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,519
It was in the church, it was there in Philippi, in the city of Philippi where he was imprisoned

418
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,799
really when that church got a great start and he was ministering there.

419
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,440
Now many years later, he's writing back to this church under the inspiration of the Holy

420
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,559
Spirit of God from prison.

421
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:17,759
And he says in verse number 10, but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your

422
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:26,919
care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.

423
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,720
And we understand even as we've looked at some of these thoughts already of being caring

424
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,199
and generous and content, we see some of this here even in this verse of Scripture.

425
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:39,639
In verse number 11, notice what Paul says, not that I speak in respect of want, then

426
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:48,559
notice the statement, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

427
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,759
I know both how to, how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things

428
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,639
I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

429
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:05,679
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

430
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,000
I've often said to individuals and I've said publicly from this pulpit that I cannot say

431
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,799
as Paul said in verse number 11 that I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith

432
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,720
to be content.

433
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I'm trying to learn, I am learning in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

434
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,919
Maybe you're here this morning and you have the ability to say as Paul said, I have learned,

435
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,720
I am content no matter what the circumstances are.

436
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,919
But the reality is that as we grow in Christ, as we draw closer to the Lord, that we're

437
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,720
learning that subject of contentment, that disposition, that understanding that my God

438
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,600
shall supply all our need.

439
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,059
And he says that later on in this text of Scripture in verse number 19, and what a blessing

440
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:00,100
to consider that God is the one that can supply everything and he teaches us to be content,

441
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,419
to be content.

442
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:05,979
So many people today, they're not content with where they are in life.

443
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:10,419
They're chasing this and they're chasing that and they think if they could have that, that

444
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:11,899
it would just allow them to be content.

445
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:17,660
I'm going to tell you this morning that you need to learn to be content where you are.

446
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,380
Learning contentment.

447
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,419
God is in control.

448
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:21,380
God has a plan.

449
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,380
God has a purpose and God gives us exactly what it is that we need.

450
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,259
She was caring, she was generous, she was content back in 2 Kings chapter number 4,

451
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,699
number 4.

452
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:34,059
She was blessed.

453
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,539
She was blessed.

454
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:40,660
The Bible tells us in verse number 16 that she hears Elisha make that declaration about

455
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,899
this season according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.

456
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:53,100
In verse number 17, the Bible says, and the woman conceived and bear a son the season

457
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,739
that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life.

458
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:03,660
What a tremendous blessing and she had been barren, but now she would be blessed with

459
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:10,019
a son and what a tremendous truth that we find in God's word with regard to the sanctity

460
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:12,539
of life and the preciousness of life.

461
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,059
We live in a society today in which they do not value human life and it's unfortunate.

462
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:25,339
We have just the progressive mindset with regard to abortion and a lack of understanding

463
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:28,139
of the sanctity of life.

464
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:34,859
In fact, there are many today that are being surveyed that are young aged people in their

465
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:41,179
20s and 30s and they will make statements such as this, I don't want to be inconvenienced

466
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,140
with children.

467
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:51,580
For anyone that's barren, that's a tragic statement to hear somebody say.

468
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,380
Children are not a burden, children are a blessing.

469
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Children are work, amen?

470
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,500
Children are a blessing, not a burden.

471
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,419
We have this society that's grown up, this very, you know, the selfie generation, it's

472
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,899
all about them and it's all about their, what they want in life and they don't want

473
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,260
to be inconvenienced.

474
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:20,380
They don't want their life to be restricted in any way, shape or form because of children.

475
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,140
The birth rate in America has declined greatly.

476
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,979
If you look at it globally, you see that there's some other nations around the world that their

477
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:35,820
birth rate is way higher than what the birth rate of American citizens is and we see that

478
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,539
change that's going on in our society.

479
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,779
But this lady, she was blessed, she conceived and she bear a son and the Bible says in verse

480
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:48,099
18, when the child was grown, and I think about those formative years, we don't know

481
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:52,659
how old he is because we know that he's old enough that he goes out into the field and

482
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:57,020
he's there as his father is working in the field with the reapers and again, we don't

483
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,140
know the age of the son, we can make speculation.

484
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,880
And the Bible says that it has grown and I think about those formative years and I think

485
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,680
about that opportunity and about this Shunammite woman and the blessing of having a child.

486
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:16,120
Notice if you will, Psalm 113, we'll look at two Psalms, verses in the book of Psalms.

487
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,600
Look at first with me at Psalm 113.

488
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,360
God is the giver of life.

489
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,440
God is the sustainer of life.

490
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm thankful that God is the author of eternal life.

491
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,080
Life is precious, but more important than being alive and breathing here this morning,

492
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,960
the most important thing is the spiritual life that is offered through the Lord Jesus

493
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,320
Christ.

494
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,200
The Bible tells us that there's a time to be born and a time to die.

495
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,720
The Bible tells us as an appointed unto man wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

496
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,560
And we understand the life and some people have the idea that life here on earth, this

497
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,400
physical life, is really all there is to it.

498
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,160
I mean, just live the best you can and get the most toys and I mean, just live it up

499
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,040
because this is all there is.

500
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I'm sorry, but God tells us that there is eternity.

501
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,760
And the most precious thing is that God is the author of eternal salvation.

502
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
We find that He offers that eternal life.

503
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,800
You're here living this morning.

504
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,520
You have breath and life and none of us know how long we will have to live, but I hope

505
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,720
this morning you're sure of heaven.

506
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,840
You've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal savior and received the gift of life,

507
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,800
which is eternal life, or the gift of God, which is eternal life.

508
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,920
Notice here, as we think about the blessing of this Shunammite woman in Psalm 113 and

509
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,880
verse number nine, the Bible says, He, speaking of God, He maketh the barren woman to keep

510
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,160
her house, and to be a joyful mother of children, praise ye the Lord.

511
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,720
What a blessing.

512
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:06,080
In Psalm 127, in verse number three, a verse of Scripture that's familiar to many of us,

513
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,960
the Bible says, Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is

514
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
His reward.

515
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,640
The Bible continues in verses four and five and says, As arrows are in the hand of a mighty

516
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,160
man, so are children of the youth.

517
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.

518
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,240
They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

519
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,000
As we think about the children being an heritage of the Lord and speaking within the context

520
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
this morning of Christian families and Christian homes and understanding the blessing that

521
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,440
God would give to any of us to have children.

522
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,320
And understanding that God lends them to us, loans them to us for a season.

523
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,160
We have an opportunity to invest in them and to influence them and to instruct them and

524
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,760
to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

525
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,800
The Bible says, As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth.

526
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,120
And you think about an arrow, and I'm not in archery whatsoever, I don't do well with

527
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,360
that sort of thing, but I do know a little bit about it, and that is that the arrow flies

528
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,240
in the direction in which you point it.

529
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,480
Is that accurate this morning?

530
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,080
The arrow is going to fly in the direction in which you point it or aim it.

531
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,640
Doesn't mean you're going to hit the target necessarily, especially speaking of me, but

532
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,560
the reality is that it's going to go in that direction as you aim it.

533
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,480
You know, we need to bring our children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

534
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,860
We need to guide them and direct them.

535
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,480
Children have decisions ahead of them that are difficult decisions that are lifelong

536
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,520
decisions with regard to the decisions they make with regard to career, with regard to

537
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,080
family and all of those things, and how God has given parents an opportunity to invest

538
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,880
in them and to instruct them and to show them the way that they ought to go.

539
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,760
I mentioned this on Wednesday evening, but recently I have been confronted by a couple

540
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,160
of churches that have no pastors, and I've had some conversation over the last few days

541
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,760
with some other folks about trying to find, look, there's some churches that are ready

542
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,320
to just basically close down because there's no pastors, and there's some churches that

543
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,080
have been without pastors for extended periods of time that are just kind of hanging on by

544
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,920
a thread, if you will, and what do we do?

545
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,160
And I got correspondence yesterday from one individual that said, preacher, you know,

546
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,860
the problem is that there's a lot more churches looking for pastors than are our pastors

547
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,840
looking for churches.

548
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,800
It's a sad situation, what's going on in America.

549
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,680
It might be that God will allow us to have children and that God would call our children

550
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,120
to the ministry, not only pastoring, but missionaries.

551
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,080
We have, if you look at our board of missionaries, I'm thankful for the young families that we

552
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,080
have, but we have a lot of older families of missionaries as well.

553
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,760
They need to, we need to be raising up the next generation of servants.

554
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,960
We need to be praying to the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth laborers, children,

555
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
our inheritance of the Lord.

556
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,080
We need to rejoice in the blessing that we see here in this passage of Scripture.

557
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
She was blessed.

558
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,840
I want you to see that it turns, from a human perspective, in our text of Scripture in 2

559
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,680
Kings chapter 4, really to a tragic situation.

560
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,480
The Bible tells us, as we've read already, that He's there in the field with His Father,

561
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,280
that He went out to His Father, to the reapers, in verse 18, verse 19, it says that He said

562
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,720
unto His Father, My head, My head.

563
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,520
He said to the lad, carry him to his mother.

564
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,480
When He had taken him and brought him to his mother, He sat on her knees till noon and

565
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,960
then died.

566
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,400
Those are sad words.

567
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,520
I would say that as she was blessed, number five, she was broken.

568
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:04,640
There are periods of time in our lives of brokenness, periods of times in which we have

569
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,760
hearts that are heavy, that are overwhelmed, and verse 27, we'll get there in a moment,

570
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,000
but it says that her soul is vexed within her.

571
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,360
I don't know all that you're going through, I don't know the brokenness that anyone specifically

572
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,320
is dealing with, but understand that many people in our society today, many people in

573
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,520
our churches today, they're broken, they're broken.

574
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm thankful that we serve a great God.

575
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,120
We serve a God who tells us that we can cast our burden upon the Lord, that we can bring

576
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,200
our care to the Lord, knowing that He cares for us.

577
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,880
I think about that song that we sang this morning, it's just like His great love, and

578
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,000
when we sang that song this morning, we had the opportunity to think about the words of

579
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,760
one of those, the third, I believe it was the third verse of that particular song and

580
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,320
understanding of His great love.

581
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:09,920
And it says, when life seems more than useless and I were better dead, I take my grief to

582
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Jesus then, nor do I go in vain, for heavenly hope He gives, that cheers like sunshine after

583
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
rain.

584
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,800
There's some people that are broken, and here I believe that this circumstance in the

585
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,960
life of this Shunammite woman brought her to a place of brokenness, but I want you to

586
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,760
see what she does in her brokenness, because I believe that as we look and examine what

587
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,920
she does in her brokenness, what is revealed to us is her faith.

588
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,200
Her faith is evidenced through this period of brokenness.

589
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,680
Someone said this, a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted.

590
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,960
A faith that cannot be tested is a faith that cannot be trusted.

591
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,320
Listen, we serve the God of the universe.

592
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,640
You may be facing some situation, this Shunammite woman, she was facing a situation where her

593
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,000
son died.

594
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,160
In verse 21, the Bible says that she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,

595
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,600
and shut the door upon him and went out.

596
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,760
I want you to consider verse 21.

597
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm assuming that this lad probably had his own bed.

598
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm assuming that the boy, the son, had his own bed, but she does not take and lay her

599
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,680
son on his own bed.

600
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,520
I believe that she's rejoicing at this very moment in the fact that she said to her husband,

601
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,000
let's make this prophet's chamber.

602
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,320
And in that prophet's chamber, she calls it a little chamber, but she says, let us put

603
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,520
there, set there for him a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick.

604
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,640
And we find that now when her son dies there upon her knees in verse number 20, that in

605
00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:01,239
verse 21, she takes this body of her son and she lays him on the bed of the man of God.

606
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,880
The Bible tells us that she shut the door upon him and went out and she called unto

607
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,119
her husband and notice what she says in verse 22, send me, I pray thee, one of the young

608
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,280
men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God, but then notice this and

609
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,040
come again.

610
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,840
I believe that she had every expectation.

611
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,440
Where was she going to run to in the moment of her crisis?

612
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,960
In the moment of her brokenness, what was she going to do?

613
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,400
She says, I need to get to the man of God.

614
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I want you to understand in Israel's history at this particular time and the ministry of

615
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,960
the prophets, this was the place for her to run.

616
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm thankful today with New Testament understanding and what Jesus Christ did on the cross of

617
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:52,480
Calvary and how he rent the veil and twain and he provided direct access for every child

618
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
of God.

619
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,119
If you're saved by the blood of Christ this morning, you have direct access to God almighty

620
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,200
and you can run to God.

621
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,320
In the moment of your brokenness, in the moment of your despair, in your heaviness, and the Bible says that she ran

622
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,000
She desired to run to the man of God and said I'll come again in verse 23

623
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,800
And he said notice what the husband says wherefore will thou go to him today?

624
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,620
It is neither new moon nor Sabbath, and she said it shall be well

625
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,340
It did not matter what the timing was there was an urgent circumstance

626
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,860
There was a need that she had in her life and though it was not a new moon though

627
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,480
It was not a Sabbath. She needed to get to the man of God

628
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
It's about a 25 mile journey

629
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,540
25 miles for us today well in northern, Virginia could take a while

630
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
but 25 miles

631
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
on a donkey

632
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
And notice what she says

633
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,700
She sat on an ass then she sat on an ass and said to the servant drive and go forward then notice this

634
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,700
Slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee. That's why she asked for one of the young men

635
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,620
Amen

636
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,580
because some of the old men couldn't go as fast as she wanted to go and so she called for one of those young men and

637
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
She said do not slack

638
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:20,520
Thy writing for me in other words there was urgency we need to get to the man of God

639
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
Verse

640
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,700
25 so she went and came into the man of God to Mount Carmel

641
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,940
It came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to cause a a servant behold

642
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
yonder is that Shunammite

643
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
You know he recognized her

644
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,140
Because she provided a place for him to dwell and he was there so often

645
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:49,300
And when she's coming even from a distance. He says to his servant Gehazi. He says the Shunammite

646
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,780
Shunammite

647
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,660
He then tells Gehazi run now

648
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,220
I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband as well with the child

649
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,580
Notice the three questions is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child?

650
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
Why was she running to the man of God?

651
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,900
Because in verse number 20 her son died

652
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
And Elisha says

653
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,140
To Gehazi

654
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,780
Run to her and ask her three specific questions number one is it well with thee number two is it?

655
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Well with your husband number three is it well?

656
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,300
with the child and I want you to see her response it is

657
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
Well

658
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
It is well

659
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
Is that what you would expect

660
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,140
It is well

661
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
We sing the song

662
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
What a wonderful song it is

663
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,260
Almost always when we have favorites someone is going to pick it as well with my soul

664
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,740
and we know the story that

665
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,860
Really led to the writing of that song and the tragic fire of Chicago and the

666
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
descending ahead of a family in a

667
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,500
disaster on the seas where the the daughters are killed they drown and

668
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Correspondences received back in Chicago

669
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Saved alone

670
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Just the wife made it across

671
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,780
And Horatio Spafford sat down as he took that journey across the sea and he asked

672
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,820
The captain of the ship as they got to around the area where the tragedy took place

673
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
If he could let him know where it was

674
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,820
And he sat down and he wrote the words of that song it is well

675
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,180
with my soul

676
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,100
It's amazing, you know what that is it's the grace of God

677
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,420
It is the grace of God

678
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:55,100
That would allow for us to say it's faith that we have in the God of the universe the one

679
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,020
Who spoke it all into existence the one who controls everything?

680
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,540
And we have the privilege of knowing him and serving him and because we know that he's a great God

681
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,060
And he do with all things well and because we've experienced the grace of God

682
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,460
We can say it is well it is well

683
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,940
When she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him according to verse number 27 by the feet and

684
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:29,220
Look at what Gahazi does but Gahazi came near to thrust her away and the man of God Elisha. He said let her alone

685
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:37,680
For her soul is vexed within her and then notice this and the Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me

686
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:40,080
Elisha did not know

687
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,760
Many times the prophet of God would know ahead of time and God would reveal it supernaturally

688
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,960
But here Elisha does not know and then in verse 28. She said did I desire a son of my Lord?

689
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,720
Did I not say do not deceive me?

690
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,559
She did not even say in verse 28 that the son had died but notice in verse number 29

691
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:59,559
Then he Elisha said to Gahazi

692
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,040
Gird up my loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if they

693
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,520
any salute thee answer him not again and

694
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,400
lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth

695
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,760
Notice this I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her

696
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
She was gonna stay with the man of God

697
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
How long do you need to stay in the presence of God?

698
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,680
When you're broken, you know what the wonderful thing is you can stay as long as you need to

699
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
You can stay in the presence of God

700
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,279
And he can help you

701
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,000
He can heal that broken heart. He can give you the grace

702
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,520
Remember he said to Paul my grace is sufficient for thee. Have you found it to be so in your life?

703
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,160
See we find it to be so when we go through that difficulty

704
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,720
Many times in life. There's there's very little growth without any

705
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:10,200
Adversity or difficulty many times in life. It's through that period of hardship that that God is developing us

706
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,559
Mary and Martha believed with all of their heart that Jesus could heal Lazarus

707
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,840
They sent to Jesus to say he whom thou lovest is sick

708
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:31,200
Why did they send for Jesus? Well because Jesus healed it the power over disease and they knew that

709
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
but Jesus tarried his

710
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Departure and

711
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
both of those sisters

712
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,960
when Jesus arrives

713
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,840
They say this if thou hath been here

714
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,279
My brother would not have died. He still be alive. In fact the Jews that were there mourning as

715
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,160
Their custom would be when they heard Jesus wept. They said could not he

716
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,480
Who who made the man see that was blind they refer back to a miracle of a couple of chapters earlier

717
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,200
Could not he have healed him the answer is yes

718
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,540
But you know what? They didn't believe they didn't believe that he could bring him back from the dead

719
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
So Lazarus had to die

720
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,480
The morning the brokenness took place so that Lazarus

721
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,960
Would be in that tomb for four days and Jesus would say Lazarus come forth

722
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:41,440
He said to his disciples, I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the extent that you might believe

723
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,040
Brokenness

724
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
oftentimes leads to great growth

725
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
be in the presence of God

726
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,400
the Bible tells the verse 31 that Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child and there was

727
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,760
Neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awake

728
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,920
He put the staff there

729
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,160
But there's no power in that the Bible says in verse 32 when Elisha was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid

730
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,040
upon his bed

731
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
he went in therefore and

732
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
Shut the door upon them twain

733
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Notice this he prayed unto the Lord

734
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,100
Is your first response to difficulty prayer

735
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,500
You know why Elisha prayed he saw Elijah pray, you know some of the power of prayer

736
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,540
He prayed unto the Lord

737
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,140
And he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes his hand upon

738
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,020
His hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm

739
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,660
Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him in the

740
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:48,059
Child sneezed seven times and then notice this the child opened his eyes number six this morning finally

741
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:51,859
This Shunammite woman had the privilege to see God work

742
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,859
She had the privilege to see God work

743
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,380
What a unique privilege

744
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,700
She saw God work and giving her a son in the first place

745
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,900
But now we see that she she has the opportunity

746
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
personally to experience

747
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:12,020
the miracle working power of God Almighty

748
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,940
The Bible says that the child opened his eyes and he saw the Son of God

749
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:23,660
The Bible says that the child opened his eyes. So what happens Elisha calls Gehazi in verse 36 and said call the Shunammite

750
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,700
So he called her

751
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,980
And when she was coming unto him notice these words

752
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,780
He said take up

753
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:34,820
thy son

754
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:41,380
Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out

755
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,780
We don't have time this morning but chapter number eight

756
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,820
We don't know the exact timing with all of these events in second Kings, but chapter number eight

757
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,660
Talks about the Shunammite

758
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:00,299
Woman and her son there was a seven-year famine. So at least seven years passes and the Shunammite

759
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:05,139
This giant woman and her son are referenced in chapter number 8.

760
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:10,439
God gave her opportunity to see her son grow and live.

761
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:16,559
I don't know how long, there's no more reference with regard to either one of them after chapter number 8,

762
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:26,999
but I find this morning, this great woman in Shunem, she was caring, she was generous, she was content.

763
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:34,799
I find that she was blessed, she was broken, and then she was privileged to see God work.

764
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:40,339
I think about that last point this morning, you know it's a privilege for us to see God work.

765
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:43,139
It's a privilege, unique privilege.

766
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:45,719
Do you long to see God work in your life?

767
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:50,179
Do you long to see God work in the lives of those that He's given you opportunity to,

768
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:57,679
if you're parents, to raise, if you're church members, to minister to, you want to see God work in their lives.

769
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,419
It's a privilege to see God work.

770
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:04,759
We've got to be in the right place if we're going to see God work.

771
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:10,559
You know what led to this Shunemite woman seeing God work in all the circumstances in which she did?

772
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:17,839
It started out by her being caring and saying, constrained him to eat some bread,

773
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,199
and then perceiving that this was a holy man of God and said,

774
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:27,579
we need to build a place for him to be able to stay so that when he passes through here, he'll stay here.

775
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:33,179
He could have stayed somewhere else, someone else could, but no, she had the opportunity and she seized it.

776
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:43,019
And because of that single decision, her generosity, her service, her care, she got to see God work miraculously.

777
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,679
I hope this morning that we would not allow opportunities to pass us by, that we would seize them,

778
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:54,359
that we'd be used of the Lord, that we would see God do great and mighty things.

779
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:04,639
It's God who said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

780
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,999
If you're broken today, can I give you hope in Christ?

781
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:12,039
Can I tell you that Jesus, He heals the brokenhearted.

782
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:13,999
What a wonderful, wonderful Savior we have.

783
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:19,239
If you don't know Him as your personal Lord and Savior today, today is the day of salvation.

784
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:28,019
This morning you say, I'm a Christian, I'm saved by the grace of God, but I got this burden, I'm broken over this situation.

785
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,319
Tell it to Jesus. Tell it to Jesus.

786
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:33,779
What a privilege we have.

787
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:39,059
What a friend we have in Jesus that we can go to Him knowing that He cares for us.

788
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:39,699
Let's pray together.

789
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:40,499
Father, we love you.

790
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:41,599
We thank you for loving us.

791
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,759
Thank you for the opportunity today to celebrate mothers.

792
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:51,159
Thank you for this Shunammite woman.

793
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:54,739
Lord, thank you for the characteristics that we could look at of her life.

794
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,239
Thank you for what you revealed to us.

795
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,299
I pray, God, that you'd meet needs this morning.

796
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:00,739
Maybe there's someone that's broken.

797
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:10,759
God, would you just help them to run to you, to get into your presence, to not leave your presence, to abide in you.

798
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:17,619
Lord, I pray that you would work miraculously in our lives, that we would seize the opportunities to serve you.

799
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:25,299
Not for something that we might be able to get, but Lord, that we would serve you because you are worthy of our service.

800
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:28,699
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as only you can.

801
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:34,199
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation.

802
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:37,099
Well, thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

803
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:37,939
Would you stand with me?

804
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:39,779
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

805
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:42,599
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.
