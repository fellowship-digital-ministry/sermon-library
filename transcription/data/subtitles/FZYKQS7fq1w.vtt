WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.839
through 1st and 2nd Timothy on Sunday mornings.

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.599
Our theme is continue, but for Mother's Day,

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.119
we're gonna take a break from 1st and 2nd Timothy,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.119
head over here to 2 Kings chapter number four this morning.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.239
Mother's Day, of course, is a special day

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:17.440
that is celebrated on this, the 2nd May annually

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.959
here in the United States of America.

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.959
Anna Jarvis is credited as celebrating

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:27.600
the 1st Mother's Day, and that was back on May 10th, 1908.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.319
And prior to then, there were some times

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.919
in which various pockets of populations

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:36.240
in the United States would celebrate

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.759
or acknowledge mothers on a special day.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.080
But really, she is credited with celebrating

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.400
the 1st Mother's Day there on May 10th, 1908.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.080
It was about five years later, on May 10th, 1913,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.259
that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution,

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:56.279
and that resolution, they called for all federal employees,

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:00.720
government officials, to wear a white carnation.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.560
And they made that decree, or that resolution,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.839
if you will, on May the 10th, 1913,

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.879
and they said that they were to wear the white carnation

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:12.839
on May 11th, 1913 in honor of Mother's Day.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:16.639
It was the following year, on May 8th, 1914.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.319
I give you all this information

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.400
just to let you know the importance of it,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.440
but Congress passed a law designating

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:27.800
the second Sunday of May would be Mother's Day.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.279
In that law, they also made a request for a proclamation,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.599
and the very next day, then President Woodrow Wilson

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.440
issued a proclamation declaring

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.440
the first national Mother's Day.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.959
And so that goes all the way back to 1914.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.879
Of course, this is 2024, so 110 years ago

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.080
when it was made law.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.040
The decree, if you will, the proclamation

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.599
by President Woodrow Wilson after the law passed Congress.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.400
Today, there are over 50 nations in the world

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.760
that have a day in which they have on their calendars

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.080
an observance, a special day for observing Mother's Day.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.160
It's not always on this same day

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.559
that we celebrate here in the United States of America.

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:13.839
There are a number of countries

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.559
that do have their calendar mirrored to our calendar

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.320
based on that proclamation,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.880
but there are many other nations

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.360
that have some other time during the year.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.399
But I'm thankful this morning, early this morning,

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.960
I sent my mom a text.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.000
Of course, not able to see her today.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
They're down in South Carolina.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880
I sent her a card in the mail,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.279
and then I sent her a text this morning,

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.240
let her know that I love her and appreciate her

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.199
and all that she's done for me over the years.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.520
And I am thankful for Holly,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.679
and also let her know the appreciation that I have.

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.880
I hope that you, if your mother is still alive,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.160
have had the opportunity to thank her today.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.720
And if not, if you would do that,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.880
many, no doubt, their mothers have passed on into eternity,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.440
and that makes for a difficult day.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.600
But the remembrance of all of those wonderful memories,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.399
we certainly can rejoice in that

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.320
and thank God for the time that we're able to have.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.839
As we come to 2 Kings chapter number four,

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.800
we're looking at the ministry of Elisha.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.080
The ministry of Elisha is an exciting ministry,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.199
one in which many of us are familiar with.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.080
And as you begin the fourth chapter

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.119
of the book of 2 Kings,

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.479
we find that God gives us in the first seven verses,

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.000
it's not our text of scripture,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.520
but God provides for us the record of the miracle

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.960
of the pot of oil.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.080
Remember the widow woman,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.320
she had a debt and her husband had died

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.360
and she had two sons.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.479
And she went to the man of God, to Elisha.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.600
She said, he asked this question,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.720
what have you, what hast thou in the house?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.080
And she said, not anything in the house save a pot of oil.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.039
And God did a great miracle

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.679
and they gathered up all the vessels

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.399
and they filled from that pot of oil,

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.679
every vessel they could possibly find.

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.520
Elisha gave the instruction to sell,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.240
pay off the debt, live on the rest.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.000
What a wonderful miracle.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.279
As we come to verse number eight,

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.039
the text of scripture in which we're looking at this morning

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.240
we are introduced to a family,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.080
a husband and wife in the city of Shunem.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.839
We do not know the name of this woman.

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.079
She simply introduced to us as a great woman.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.760
In fact, often as we look at this text of scripture

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.399
in verses eight down through verse number 37,

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:27.399
she is often simply referred to as the Shunemite woman.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.000
This morning, we'll take an opportunity to review her life

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.519
as it's revealed in this passage of scripture.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.239
And I wanna note a number of characteristics

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:39.920
about this lady that would give us reason

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.920
as to why the Bible tells us that it was in this place

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.519
where was a great woman.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.760
Notice with me in verse number eight,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.119
the Bible says, and it fell on a day

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.720
that Elisha passed to Shunem where was a great woman

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
and she constrained him to eat bread.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.399
And so it was that as off as he passed by,

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.279
he turned in thither to eat bread.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.440
And she said unto her husband,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.440
behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.720
which passeth by us continually.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.440
And I praise God for her perception and her spirituality.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.839
The Bible says that she then makes this request

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.920
to her husband, she says, let us make a little chamber.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.399
I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:30.959
and a table and a stool and a candlestick.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.119
And it shall be when he cometh to us

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:38.480
that he shall turn in thither.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.959
At this point, they have no children.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.320
We'll go through the text of scripture

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.559
and see the miraculous birth of their son.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.519
But I want you to skip down, if you will,

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.440
to verse number 19.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.799
I'll give you the title for the message

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:51.720
and we'll jump into the thoughts this morning.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.920
In verse 18, it says, and when the child was grown,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.040
it fell on a day that he went out to his father,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.559
to the reapers, and he said unto his father,

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.320
my head, my head.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.239
And he said to Elad, notice this, carry him to his mother.

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:07.720
And I've titled the message this morning,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.040
carry him to his mother.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.679
There's been many times in our lives

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.559
when our children would get injured.

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:15.839
I remember as a child, if I would get injured,

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.000
it was always mom that provided more care

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.839
and compassion than dad.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.079
If I was injured as a child and I went to my dad,

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.160
he'd try to move the limb or move whatever

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.440
and say, it's not broken, son.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.760
It moves just fine, just carry on, right?

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.880
And mom was the one that you would go to

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.920
to have compassion and some care and concern.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.160
And in our home, it's the same way.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.119
Oftentimes, I'll say, I'm not sure what to do about that.

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:40.079
Go see mom.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.519
And here, this man says, carry him to his mother.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.200
As we think about this passage of scripture,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.079
we're gonna make our way through the entirety of it.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.079
I wanna give you six thoughts this morning,

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.799
and I'm gonna be brief with each one.

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:55.279
Don't get overwhelmed with having six thoughts this morning.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.940
But six thoughts this morning of characteristics

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.440
of this lady, this Shunammite woman,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.239
as we refer to her as in this text of scripture,

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:08.239
that are great characteristics that lead to God telling us

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.239
that she is a great woman.

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:14.160
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.500
I want you to note that she was caring.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500
She was a caring individual.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.600
And I'm thankful for the care that we see

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.200
in this text of scripture.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.920
The Bible says that Elisha would pass by

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.200
this particular place, and in verse number eight,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.440
the Bible says that, so it was that as oft as he passed by,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.059
he turned in thither to eat bread.

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:35.899
Why?

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:37.459
Because this Shunammite woman,

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.380
that's introduced to us in verse number eight,

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.019
that she constrained him to eat bread.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.200
She was an individual that demonstrated care.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.980
She was a caring individual.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.179
In fact, Elisha says this in verse number 13.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.380
Notice the Bible says, and he said unto him,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.579
to Gehazi, his servant, he says to say unto her,

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:02.579
this Shunammite woman, behold, thou hast been careful for us

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.660
with all this care.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.480
Begin to think about caring and being a caring individual,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.739
and we find here in the passage of scripture

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:16.160
that no doubt the evidence is given to us

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
that she cared about Elisha.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.320
Though the text of scripture does not tell us,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.839
I believe that she cared for her husband.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.160
As you look at verses eight through 11,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.320
eight through 10, excuse me,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.839
you find the interaction between this woman and her husband,

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:33.700
and I think that she had care for her husband,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.059
and it then leads to having care for Elisha, the man of God,

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.940
and eventually would have care for her own son.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.599
She has no son at the beginning of the text of scripture.

00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:48.099
We're introduced to her as being this great woman,

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:50.419
this couple with no children,

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:52.659
but we find that Elisha makes the statement

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:57.099
in verse number 16 that thou shalt embrace a son.

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:01.239
We find that she did indeed have a child,

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:02.679
and that child was grown,

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.200
as we read already in verses 18 and 19.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.799
We find that in verse number 20,

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:10.479
the Bible says that after the servant

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:13.900
had received the instruction to carry him to his mother,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.880
after he's in the field there with his father,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.580
and he says, my head, my head,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.320
that it says that when he had taken him

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.280
and brought him to his mother,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.280
he sat on her knees till noon and then died.

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:28.580
It's a sad verse of scripture as it ends,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.739
but I see her care for her son

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:32.780
as he would come in from the field,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.219
and he's got this perhaps something,

00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:38.080
maybe heat stroke, some other injury maybe that took place,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.020
and he's cried out for his head while he's in the field,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.619
and he goes to the mom.

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:46.380
The servant brings him to his mother,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.900
and she, the Bible says, that he, that son,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.020
was there with his mother and sat on her knees till noon.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.020
Maybe some of you here this morning,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.559
you can remember as a child receiving the care on the knees.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.059
of your mother.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:07.839
And the reality is that God many times, and I know this morning that this is not, the

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.479
statements that I'll make this morning are not necessarily statements that are applicable

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:14.139
in every case, and I understand that.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:21.199
But many times God has equipped mothers to have that caring heart and to demonstrate

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:25.919
that care, and we see it here in this Shunammite woman.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:30.479
Not only do we see that she was caring, but number two, I note that she was generous.

00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:32.119
She was generous.

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:35.919
You know, in our text of scripture, we see some evidence of this, but on the bulletin

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:40.439
this morning, the Bible says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:43.959
rubies from Proverbs 31 and verse number 10.

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:47.759
The only woman called virtuous throughout all of the scripture is actually Ruth.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:49.999
You find it in the book of Ruth.

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:55.879
But you'll find here that as we look through Proverbs 31 with regard to generosity that

00:10:55.879 --> 00:11:01.639
is described in that text of scripture, that you'll see in 2 Kings chapter number 4 a lady

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:03.519
that was generous.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:08.239
The Bible tells us, we've noted already in verse number 8 with regard to the provision

00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:13.360
for the man of God, that she constrained him to eat bread.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.479
The Bible says, so it was that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:24.519
Now we find that the Bible tells us that he passed that way regularly, and so this was

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.419
not just a one-time occurrence.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:29.879
This was a regular occurrence, and she constrained him.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:35.199
She was generous with her resources, constrained him to eat bread, and as oft as he passed

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:38.519
by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:40.439
Her generosity does not stop there.

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:45.119
We find that as we've read in verses 9 and 10, that she has this perception.

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:46.639
She's a spiritual lady.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:54.559
She has this perception, and she says to her husband, this is a holy man of God.

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:59.559
And she has this understanding of who the prophet of God is, Elisha, and notice what

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:04.879
she makes this request in verse number 10, let us make a little chamber.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:10.239
We find that really the idea of a prophet's chamber, we refer to that still to this very

00:12:10.239 --> 00:12:12.619
day of using that phraseology.

00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:17.739
When we built the parsonage, we put in the basement a prophet's chamber area so that

00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:22.059
those that are traveling, missionaries and evangelists, would have the opportunity to

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:27.899
have a place where they could stay and have some refreshment time and what have you.

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:33.779
And so we find that she makes this request with regard to putting this prophet's chamber,

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:35.080
this little chamber.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:42.919
She says, let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick.

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:49.360
And it shall be, notice the end of the verse, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.239
thither.

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:52.239
She was generous.

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:56.919
It wasn't an opportunity that she was going to allow to pass by.

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:02.880
She wanted to seize the opportunity that was before her, and though there's, as we look

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.239
at this text of scripture, this desire to be a blessing to the man of God, we find that

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:14.479
because of this, it resulted in the fact that Elisha would stay there.

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:20.520
That Elisha, as often as he would pass through that region, as he would travel throughout

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:27.319
the land of Israel, that he would come through and he would have a place where he could rest.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:29.679
He would have a place of provision.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:34.599
It was because of the generosity of this woman in Shunem.

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:39.720
We find that the Bible would tell us with regard to opportunities and the reality that

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.880
we're to do good as we have opportunity to do so.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.000
In Galatians chapter number six, hold your place there, and I want you to see what the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.360
Bible tells us.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.160
In Galatians chapter number six, God gives us instruction, and we ought to be looking

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160
for opportunities.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:02.399
We ought to be looking for opportunities to do good, to be generous, to be giving.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:07.800
We find that the Bible tells us in Galatians six and verse number nine, and let us not

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:14.800
be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:24.000
Then notice verse number 10, as we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.519
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:37.119
Though Galatians six was not written at the time of the ministry of Elisha, this lady

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:43.160
in Shunem did not have a copy of the book of Galatians, the opportunity presented itself

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.760
to her, and she seized the opportunity.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.200
She had the opportunity to do something for the man of God, and she goes to her husband

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.059
and she says, let us do this, let's be generous, let's be hospitable.

00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:03.359
And what a blessing, again, as we think about the man of God, Elisha, traveling, and I want

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:08.679
you to understand that not only would it be a blessing to Elisha because of her generosity,

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:13.679
but understand the way in which it would return to her and her family, because why?

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:20.839
Well, the man of God is there, and to have the privilege of having the man of God as

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.399
he would travel through to be at their place, at their residence, would be a tremendous

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.359
blessing and opportunity.

00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:33.559
We've had the privilege, and I know that some of you have as well, over your time of serving

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:39.320
the Lord, to have meals with servants of the Lord, to have opportunities, perhaps, to have

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.839
servants of the Lord stay in your home.

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:46.459
Of course, with the Prophets Chamber, we have opportunity regularly to have missionaries

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:51.739
and evangelists stay in our home, and the opportunities of fellowship and the opportunities

00:15:51.739 --> 00:15:58.339
of being able to be a blessing, I mean, they just abound, and it's such a privilege and

00:15:58.339 --> 00:15:59.619
such a blessing.

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:05.940
I remember, I think back to the opportunity when we first connected with Brother Dan Hummel,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.980
and of course, you know, our church is familiar with Beacon of Truth, and we do a lot with

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:17.179
them, and we had the opportunity at this point, about 15 years ago, to first meet Brother

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:22.059
Hummel, and it was at our church when we were in Pennsylvania, we were members of the church,

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:27.820
working a full-time job, had three little kids, and two, four, and six, I mean, we understand

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.059
what it was to be busy and to have schedules and all over the place and what have you,

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:37.019
but our church had a scripture assembly ministry, and it was in the evenings, and I remember

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:41.419
Dan Hummel standing up, we'd never heard about it before, and he stood up and he tore

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:46.859
one of the scriptures apart and showed how it gets assembled and showed the whole process,

00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:52.019
and he said this, he said, anybody that's here can do something with this scripture

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.019
assembly.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:54.980
It was the first time our church had ever done it.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:01.500
He said, from the youngest to the oldest, somebody can do some job during the scripture

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.100
assembly, and so we had three little kids, as I mentioned already, and Joseph was just

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:12.220
about two years old, just a little tot of a kid, and we thought, well, I guess he said

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.260
everyone can do it, and so Holly and I talked, and we said, we're gonna go, and we went.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.579
We were there each night of that assembly, and our kids did serve, they got involved,

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.579
but God allowed us, and Holly and I had the opportunity to chat, and we were able to take

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:30.220
Brother Hummel out and his wife and the team that was with them, it was a different group,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.940
it wasn't Dan and Donna Stroop, it was a different couple, and we were able to take them out

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.940
for dinner after one of the assemblies, and we were just able to go out to pizza, it was

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.260
late, of course, work and school the next morning and all those things, it was gonna

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:49.700
be a late night, but at that place, through having that opportunity, God allowed our hearts

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:55.600
to be knit together, and we had such a blessed opportunity, and now I think about all these

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.820
years later, and to see the blessing of that, listen, as God would give you opportunity,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:07.339
just as God gave this lady, this Shunammite woman is referred to her as this opportunity,

00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:11.540
she seized it, she was generous, and God blessed.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:17.100
I want you to notice, as we continue to read, in verse number 11, it says, and it fell on

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:25.040
a day that he, Elisha, came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.739
So he took advantage of the prophet's chamber that was made available as he traveled through.

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:36.260
The Bible says in verse number 12 that he said to Gehazi, his servant, call the Shunammite.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.500
When he had called her, she stood before him.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.979
Number three, if you're taking notes this morning, we notice not only that she was caring

00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:48.719
and generous, but we notice number three, she was content.

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:49.719
She was content.

00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:51.380
Notice what the Bible says.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.940
She stood before him at the end of verse number 12, and in verse 13, it says that he said

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:04.700
unto him, so Elisha says to Gehazi, say now unto her, behold, thou hast been careful for

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:16.299
us with all this care, and then notice this question, what is to be done for thee?

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:24.419
What is thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host?

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:32.739
What a great opportunity that is given to her as Elisha says to Gehazi, I will speak

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:33.739
on your behalf.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.640
You have been so caring for us.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.659
What is it to be done for thee?

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:46.140
Would you like us to stand before the king and speak for you or to the captain, the host?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.739
And notice her answer, I dwell among mine own people.

00:19:50.739 --> 00:19:51.739
She was content.

00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:52.739
She was content.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:59.219
She said, I dwell among my own people, and he said, what then is to be done for her?

00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:00.179
You see the heart of...

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:06.519
Elisha desiring to give and to be a blessing to this lady that had been so caring for him

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:12.119
and provided not only the bread, but also the dwelling place in that prophet's chamber.

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:15.379
And Gehazi answered in verse number 14, and he said,

00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:21.379
Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:26.539
We find that though she was in this particular place of barrenness, that she did not seem

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:27.859
to be bitter by it.

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:28.859
She was content.

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:33.939
In fact, it says that he said, call her, and when he had called her, she stood in the door.

00:20:33.939 --> 00:20:34.939
In verse 16, he said,

00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:43.059
About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:44.939
Can you imagine her hearing these words?

00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:48.939
She knew, the Bible tells us already, that she said to her husband in verse number nine,

00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:53.339
I perceive that this is an holy man of God.

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:59.539
His ministry is going forth and he's traveling to and fro, and no doubt as we understand

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:04.019
and we're familiar with the life and ministry of Elisha, there's miracles that are taking

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:10.739
place and we find that on that day that he's there and he says to her, she's called back

00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:17.739
into the presence, about this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a

00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:19.859
son.

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:21.919
She had no child.

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:26.959
Not only had no child, but her husband was old, according to verse number 14.

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:29.959
And she says in verse number 16, at the end of the verse,

00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:34.799
Nay, my Lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:39.559
It was almost beyond her ability to believe what had just been declared because she'd

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:44.799
known the circumstances that she had dealt with, but I believe that she was content not

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:50.159
only by her answer when it was asked, what is to be done for thee, that she says, I dwell

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:56.119
among mine own people, but even in the situation there with having no children, it seems as

00:21:56.119 --> 00:22:00.699
if this Sunamite woman was a content individual.

00:22:00.699 --> 00:22:05.639
She did not serve so that she could get something.

00:22:05.639 --> 00:22:11.759
She did not perceive that Elisha was a man of God and that Elisha was a prophet of God

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:15.439
and that we're going to be generous and we're going to have him here so that we can get

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:16.439
something.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:21.239
See, that's not the motive for giving and for serving.

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:25.439
We're content in what God has given to us and the opportunities that he has given to

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:29.879
us and the blessings that he will allow in our lives.

00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:34.199
See if our motive for serving, God knows our motives, by the way, if our motive for serving

00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:38.439
is so that I might get something out of it, then we have a wrong motive.

00:22:38.439 --> 00:22:43.359
We have a selfish motive and we find that God does not bless that.

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:48.339
We live in a society today, in fact, many times, though it's not publicly known because

00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:53.000
of legal ramifications and what have you, but many people say, well, I'll do this for

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.479
you if you do this for me.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:59.799
And that's the way often things work in a society.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:04.159
But here, this Sunamite woman, she was content.

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.439
She did not serve so that she could get something.

00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:07.439
She was content.

00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:10.359
You know, contentment is a great thing.

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:15.599
Many people in our society today are living lives of discontentment.

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:19.959
We think of the society in which we live in and we think that if I could just have more,

00:23:19.959 --> 00:23:25.039
if I could just have this, if I could just, then I would be content.

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:29.219
The reality is that there were surveys done at this point, they're years ago when these

00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:35.439
surveys were done, but they surveyed a group of people across every spectrum of income

00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:37.119
level.

00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:43.000
From the lowest income level to the highest, they just went through, they started, I think,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.759
at $25,000 a year and they went up to like $250,000 a year and just looked at that category

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.399
of people and that income area.

00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:57.199
And they went through and they gave, and they said, how much more would you need to be content?

00:23:57.199 --> 00:24:01.839
You know, it was consistent that each earner in each of those categories said, you know,

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:06.239
if I could just have $10,000 more, I'd be, I'd be okay.

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:10.879
And that's what the one in the lowest income said and the one in the $250,000 income, they

00:24:10.879 --> 00:24:12.679
all said the same thing.

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:16.000
There were options for them to select and it's, it's interesting.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.359
We live in a society that, that really is designed to make you discontent.

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:28.600
We live in a midst of a generation of marketing and all sorts of things that, that really

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.239
the enemy wants you to be discontent.

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:35.559
But I want you to look at Philippians chapter number four.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:40.399
As I think about the, the Shunammite woman and I think about her contentment as we see

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:45.559
in this passage of Scripture, I want to encourage you this morning to be content.

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:49.639
We find that in Philippians chapter number four, Paul is writing, and many of us would

00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:52.880
be familiar with the fact that he's writing this church in Philippi and he's writing from

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880
prison.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.519
It was in the church, it was there in Philippi, in the city of Philippi where he was imprisoned

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:05.799
really when that church got a great start and he was ministering there.

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:09.440
Now many years later, he's writing back to this church under the inspiration of the Holy

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.559
Spirit of God from prison.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:17.759
And he says in verse number 10, but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:26.919
care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:30.720
And we understand even as we've looked at some of these thoughts already of being caring

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.199
and generous and content, we see some of this here even in this verse of Scripture.

00:25:35.199 --> 00:25:39.639
In verse number 11, notice what Paul says, not that I speak in respect of want, then

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:48.559
notice the statement, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:54.759
I know both how to, how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:59.639
I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:05.679
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:11.000
I've often said to individuals and I've said publicly from this pulpit that I cannot say

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.799
as Paul said in verse number 11 that I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:17.720
to be content.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:24.720
I'm trying to learn, I am learning in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.919
Maybe you're here this morning and you have the ability to say as Paul said, I have learned,

00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:32.720
I am content no matter what the circumstances are.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.919
But the reality is that as we grow in Christ, as we draw closer to the Lord, that we're

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:44.720
learning that subject of contentment, that disposition, that understanding that my God

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.600
shall supply all our need.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.059
And he says that later on in this text of Scripture in verse number 19, and what a blessing

00:26:53.100 --> 00:27:00.100
to consider that God is the one that can supply everything and he teaches us to be content,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.419
to be content.

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:05.979
So many people today, they're not content with where they are in life.

00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:10.419
They're chasing this and they're chasing that and they think if they could have that, that

00:27:10.419 --> 00:27:11.899
it would just allow them to be content.

00:27:11.899 --> 00:27:17.660
I'm going to tell you this morning that you need to learn to be content where you are.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.380
Learning contentment.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.419
God is in control.

00:27:20.419 --> 00:27:21.380
God has a plan.

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:26.380
God has a purpose and God gives us exactly what it is that we need.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.259
She was caring, she was generous, she was content back in 2 Kings chapter number 4,

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:31.699
number 4.

00:27:31.699 --> 00:27:34.059
She was blessed.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:35.539
She was blessed.

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:40.660
The Bible tells us in verse number 16 that she hears Elisha make that declaration about

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.899
this season according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:53.100
In verse number 17, the Bible says, and the woman conceived and bear a son the season

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.739
that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life.

00:27:58.739 --> 00:28:03.660
What a tremendous blessing and she had been barren, but now she would be blessed with

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:10.019
a son and what a tremendous truth that we find in God's word with regard to the sanctity

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:12.539
of life and the preciousness of life.

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:18.059
We live in a society today in which they do not value human life and it's unfortunate.

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:25.339
We have just the progressive mindset with regard to abortion and a lack of understanding

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:28.139
of the sanctity of life.

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:34.859
In fact, there are many today that are being surveyed that are young aged people in their

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:41.179
20s and 30s and they will make statements such as this, I don't want to be inconvenienced

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.140
with children.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:51.580
For anyone that's barren, that's a tragic statement to hear somebody say.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.380
Children are not a burden, children are a blessing.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.380
Children are work, amen?

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.500
Children are a blessing, not a burden.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.419
We have this society that's grown up, this very, you know, the selfie generation, it's

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:10.899
all about them and it's all about their, what they want in life and they don't want

00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:12.260
to be inconvenienced.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:20.380
They don't want their life to be restricted in any way, shape or form because of children.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.140
The birth rate in America has declined greatly.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.979
If you look at it globally, you see that there's some other nations around the world that their

00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:35.820
birth rate is way higher than what the birth rate of American citizens is and we see that

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.539
change that's going on in our society.

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:43.779
But this lady, she was blessed, she conceived and she bear a son and the Bible says in verse

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:48.099
18, when the child was grown, and I think about those formative years, we don't know

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:52.659
how old he is because we know that he's old enough that he goes out into the field and

00:29:52.659 --> 00:29:57.020
he's there as his father is working in the field with the reapers and again, we don't

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.140
know the age of the son, we can make speculation.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.880
And the Bible says that it has grown and I think about those formative years and I think

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:10.680
about that opportunity and about this Shunammite woman and the blessing of having a child.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:16.120
Notice if you will, Psalm 113, we'll look at two Psalms, verses in the book of Psalms.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:21.600
Look at first with me at Psalm 113.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.360
God is the giver of life.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.440
God is the sustainer of life.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.400
I'm thankful that God is the author of eternal life.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.080
Life is precious, but more important than being alive and breathing here this morning,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.960
the most important thing is the spiritual life that is offered through the Lord Jesus

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.320
Christ.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.200
The Bible tells us that there's a time to be born and a time to die.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.720
The Bible tells us as an appointed unto man wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.560
And we understand the life and some people have the idea that life here on earth, this

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.400
physical life, is really all there is to it.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.160
I mean, just live the best you can and get the most toys and I mean, just live it up

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.040
because this is all there is.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.040
I'm sorry, but God tells us that there is eternity.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.760
And the most precious thing is that God is the author of eternal salvation.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.240
We find that He offers that eternal life.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.800
You're here living this morning.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:29.520
You have breath and life and none of us know how long we will have to live, but I hope

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.720
this morning you're sure of heaven.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.840
You've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal savior and received the gift of life,

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.800
which is eternal life, or the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.920
Notice here, as we think about the blessing of this Shunammite woman in Psalm 113 and

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.880
verse number nine, the Bible says, He, speaking of God, He maketh the barren woman to keep

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:56.160
her house, and to be a joyful mother of children, praise ye the Lord.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.720
What a blessing.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:06.080
In Psalm 127, in verse number three, a verse of Scripture that's familiar to many of us,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.960
the Bible says, Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.520
His reward.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.640
The Bible continues in verses four and five and says, As arrows are in the hand of a mighty

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.160
man, so are children of the youth.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.760
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.240
They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.000
As we think about the children being an heritage of the Lord and speaking within the context

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
this morning of Christian families and Christian homes and understanding the blessing that

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.440
God would give to any of us to have children.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.320
And understanding that God lends them to us, loans them to us for a season.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.160
We have an opportunity to invest in them and to influence them and to instruct them and

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.760
to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.800
The Bible says, As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.120
And you think about an arrow, and I'm not in archery whatsoever, I don't do well with

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.360
that sort of thing, but I do know a little bit about it, and that is that the arrow flies

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.240
in the direction in which you point it.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.480
Is that accurate this morning?

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:23.080
The arrow is going to fly in the direction in which you point it or aim it.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.640
Doesn't mean you're going to hit the target necessarily, especially speaking of me, but

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.560
the reality is that it's going to go in that direction as you aim it.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.480
You know, we need to bring our children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.860
We need to guide them and direct them.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:42.480
Children have decisions ahead of them that are difficult decisions that are lifelong

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:49.520
decisions with regard to the decisions they make with regard to career, with regard to

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:56.080
family and all of those things, and how God has given parents an opportunity to invest

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.880
in them and to instruct them and to show them the way that they ought to go.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.760
I mentioned this on Wednesday evening, but recently I have been confronted by a couple

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.160
of churches that have no pastors, and I've had some conversation over the last few days

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.760
with some other folks about trying to find, look, there's some churches that are ready

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.320
to just basically close down because there's no pastors, and there's some churches that

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.080
have been without pastors for extended periods of time that are just kind of hanging on by

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.920
a thread, if you will, and what do we do?

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.160
And I got correspondence yesterday from one individual that said, preacher, you know,

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.860
the problem is that there's a lot more churches looking for pastors than are our pastors

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.840
looking for churches.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.800
It's a sad situation, what's going on in America.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.680
It might be that God will allow us to have children and that God would call our children

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:51.120
to the ministry, not only pastoring, but missionaries.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.080
We have, if you look at our board of missionaries, I'm thankful for the young families that we

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:00.080
have, but we have a lot of older families of missionaries as well.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.760
They need to, we need to be raising up the next generation of servants.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.960
We need to be praying to the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth laborers, children,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.000
our inheritance of the Lord.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.080
We need to rejoice in the blessing that we see here in this passage of Scripture.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080
She was blessed.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.840
I want you to see that it turns, from a human perspective, in our text of Scripture in 2

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.680
Kings chapter 4, really to a tragic situation.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.480
The Bible tells us, as we've read already, that He's there in the field with His Father,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.280
that He went out to His Father, to the reapers, in verse 18, verse 19, it says that He said

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.720
unto His Father, My head, My head.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.520
He said to the lad, carry him to his mother.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.480
When He had taken him and brought him to his mother, He sat on her knees till noon and

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.960
then died.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.400
Those are sad words.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.520
I would say that as she was blessed, number five, she was broken.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.640
There are periods of time in our lives of brokenness, periods of times in which we have

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.760
hearts that are heavy, that are overwhelmed, and verse 27, we'll get there in a moment,

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:16.000
but it says that her soul is vexed within her.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.360
I don't know all that you're going through, I don't know the brokenness that anyone specifically

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:26.320
is dealing with, but understand that many people in our society today, many people in

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.520
our churches today, they're broken, they're broken.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.240
I'm thankful that we serve a great God.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.120
We serve a God who tells us that we can cast our burden upon the Lord, that we can bring

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.200
our care to the Lord, knowing that He cares for us.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.880
I think about that song that we sang this morning, it's just like His great love, and

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.000
when we sang that song this morning, we had the opportunity to think about the words of

00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.760
one of those, the third, I believe it was the third verse of that particular song and

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.320
understanding of His great love.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:09.920
And it says, when life seems more than useless and I were better dead, I take my grief to

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:18.840
Jesus then, nor do I go in vain, for heavenly hope He gives, that cheers like sunshine after

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
rain.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.800
There's some people that are broken, and here I believe that this circumstance in the

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.960
life of this Shunammite woman brought her to a place of brokenness, but I want you to

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.760
see what she does in her brokenness, because I believe that as we look and examine what

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.920
she does in her brokenness, what is revealed to us is her faith.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.200
Her faith is evidenced through this period of brokenness.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:51.680
Someone said this, a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.960
A faith that cannot be tested is a faith that cannot be trusted.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.320
Listen, we serve the God of the universe.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.640
You may be facing some situation, this Shunammite woman, she was facing a situation where her

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.000
son died.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.160
In verse 21, the Bible says that she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.600
and shut the door upon him and went out.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.760
I want you to consider verse 21.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.160
I'm assuming that this lad probably had his own bed.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.520
I'm assuming that the boy, the son, had his own bed, but she does not take and lay her

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.680
son on his own bed.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.520
I believe that she's rejoicing at this very moment in the fact that she said to her husband,

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.000
let's make this prophet's chamber.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.320
And in that prophet's chamber, she calls it a little chamber, but she says, let us put

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.520
there, set there for him a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.640
And we find that now when her son dies there upon her knees in verse number 20, that in

00:38:51.640 --> 00:39:01.239
verse 21, she takes this body of her son and she lays him on the bed of the man of God.

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:05.880
The Bible tells us that she shut the door upon him and went out and she called unto

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.119
her husband and notice what she says in verse 22, send me, I pray thee, one of the young

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:18.280
men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God, but then notice this and

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.040
come again.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.840
I believe that she had every expectation.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.440
Where was she going to run to in the moment of her crisis?

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.960
In the moment of her brokenness, what was she going to do?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.400
She says, I need to get to the man of God.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:35.400
I want you to understand in Israel's history at this particular time and the ministry of

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.960
the prophets, this was the place for her to run.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:45.400
I'm thankful today with New Testament understanding and what Jesus Christ did on the cross of

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:52.480
Calvary and how he rent the veil and twain and he provided direct access for every child

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.480
of God.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.119
If you're saved by the blood of Christ this morning, you have direct access to God almighty

00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:00.200
and you can run to God.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.320
In the moment of your brokenness, in the moment of your despair, in your heaviness, and the Bible says that she ran

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.000
She desired to run to the man of God and said I'll come again in verse 23

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.800
And he said notice what the husband says wherefore will thou go to him today?

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.620
It is neither new moon nor Sabbath, and she said it shall be well

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.340
It did not matter what the timing was there was an urgent circumstance

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.860
There was a need that she had in her life and though it was not a new moon though

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.480
It was not a Sabbath. She needed to get to the man of God

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860
It's about a 25 mile journey

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.540
25 miles for us today well in northern, Virginia could take a while

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.820
but 25 miles

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.780
on a donkey

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.900
And notice what she says

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.700
She sat on an ass then she sat on an ass and said to the servant drive and go forward then notice this

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.700
Slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee. That's why she asked for one of the young men

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.620
Amen

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:10.580
because some of the old men couldn't go as fast as she wanted to go and so she called for one of those young men and

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.980
She said do not slack

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:20.520
Thy writing for me in other words there was urgency we need to get to the man of God

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.100
Verse

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.700
25 so she went and came into the man of God to Mount Carmel

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.940
It came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to cause a a servant behold

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.820
yonder is that Shunammite

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.380
You know he recognized her

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.140
Because she provided a place for him to dwell and he was there so often

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.300
And when she's coming even from a distance. He says to his servant Gehazi. He says the Shunammite

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.780
Shunammite

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.660
He then tells Gehazi run now

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:59.220
I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband as well with the child

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:06.580
Notice the three questions is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child?

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.020
Why was she running to the man of God?

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.900
Because in verse number 20 her son died

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.140
And Elisha says

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.140
To Gehazi

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.780
Run to her and ask her three specific questions number one is it well with thee number two is it?

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.780
Well with your husband number three is it well?

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.300
with the child and I want you to see her response it is

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.620
Well

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.780
It is well

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.140
Is that what you would expect

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.140
It is well

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.140
We sing the song

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.300
What a wonderful song it is

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.260
Almost always when we have favorites someone is going to pick it as well with my soul

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.740
and we know the story that

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.860
Really led to the writing of that song and the tragic fire of Chicago and the

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.620
descending ahead of a family in a

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.500
disaster on the seas where the the daughters are killed they drown and

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.300
Correspondences received back in Chicago

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.300
Saved alone

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.500
Just the wife made it across

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:26.780
And Horatio Spafford sat down as he took that journey across the sea and he asked

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.820
The captain of the ship as they got to around the area where the tragedy took place

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.340
If he could let him know where it was

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.820
And he sat down and he wrote the words of that song it is well

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.180
with my soul

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:46.100
It's amazing, you know what that is it's the grace of God

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.420
It is the grace of God

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:55.100
That would allow for us to say it's faith that we have in the God of the universe the one

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.020
Who spoke it all into existence the one who controls everything?

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:05.540
And we have the privilege of knowing him and serving him and because we know that he's a great God

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.060
And he do with all things well and because we've experienced the grace of God

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.460
We can say it is well it is well

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.940
When she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him according to verse number 27 by the feet and

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:29.220
Look at what Gahazi does but Gahazi came near to thrust her away and the man of God Elisha. He said let her alone

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:37.680
For her soul is vexed within her and then notice this and the Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me

00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:40.080
Elisha did not know

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.760
Many times the prophet of God would know ahead of time and God would reveal it supernaturally

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.960
But here Elisha does not know and then in verse 28. She said did I desire a son of my Lord?

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.720
Did I not say do not deceive me?

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.559
She did not even say in verse 28 that the son had died but notice in verse number 29

00:44:57.559 --> 00:44:59.559
Then he Elisha said to Gahazi

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:06.040
Gird up my loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if they

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.520
any salute thee answer him not again and

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:15.400
lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.760
Notice this I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.360
She was gonna stay with the man of God

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.880
How long do you need to stay in the presence of God?

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.680
When you're broken, you know what the wonderful thing is you can stay as long as you need to

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.120
You can stay in the presence of God

00:45:36.279 --> 00:45:38.279
And he can help you

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.000
He can heal that broken heart. He can give you the grace

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:50.520
Remember he said to Paul my grace is sufficient for thee. Have you found it to be so in your life?

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.160
See we find it to be so when we go through that difficulty

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.720
Many times in life. There's there's very little growth without any

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:10.200
Adversity or difficulty many times in life. It's through that period of hardship that that God is developing us

00:46:11.559 --> 00:46:16.559
Mary and Martha believed with all of their heart that Jesus could heal Lazarus

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.840
They sent to Jesus to say he whom thou lovest is sick

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:31.200
Why did they send for Jesus? Well because Jesus healed it the power over disease and they knew that

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.400
but Jesus tarried his

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.720
Departure and

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760
both of those sisters

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.960
when Jesus arrives

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.840
They say this if thou hath been here

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.279
My brother would not have died. He still be alive. In fact the Jews that were there mourning as

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.160
Their custom would be when they heard Jesus wept. They said could not he

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.480
Who who made the man see that was blind they refer back to a miracle of a couple of chapters earlier

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.200
Could not he have healed him the answer is yes

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.540
But you know what? They didn't believe they didn't believe that he could bring him back from the dead

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.040
So Lazarus had to die

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:25.480
The morning the brokenness took place so that Lazarus

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:32.960
Would be in that tomb for four days and Jesus would say Lazarus come forth

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:41.440
He said to his disciples, I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the extent that you might believe

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.040
Brokenness

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.040
oftentimes leads to great growth

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.800
be in the presence of God

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:55.400
the Bible tells the verse 31 that Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child and there was

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.760
Neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awake

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.920
He put the staff there

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:07.160
But there's no power in that the Bible says in verse 32 when Elisha was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.040
upon his bed

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.040
he went in therefore and

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.320
Shut the door upon them twain

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.800
Notice this he prayed unto the Lord

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.100
Is your first response to difficulty prayer

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:26.500
You know why Elisha prayed he saw Elijah pray, you know some of the power of prayer

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.540
He prayed unto the Lord

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.140
And he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes his hand upon

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.020
His hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.660
Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him in the

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:48.059
Child sneezed seven times and then notice this the child opened his eyes number six this morning finally

00:48:48.179 --> 00:48:51.859
This Shunammite woman had the privilege to see God work

00:48:52.859 --> 00:48:54.859
She had the privilege to see God work

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.380
What a unique privilege

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.700
She saw God work and giving her a son in the first place

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.900
But now we see that she she has the opportunity

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.500
personally to experience

00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:12.020
the miracle working power of God Almighty

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.940
The Bible says that the child opened his eyes and he saw the Son of God

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:23.660
The Bible says that the child opened his eyes. So what happens Elisha calls Gehazi in verse 36 and said call the Shunammite

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.700
So he called her

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.980
And when she was coming unto him notice these words

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.780
He said take up

00:49:33.059 --> 00:49:34.820
thy son

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:41.380
Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.780
We don't have time this morning but chapter number eight

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.820
We don't know the exact timing with all of these events in second Kings, but chapter number eight

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.660
Talks about the Shunammite

00:49:54.100 --> 00:50:00.299
Woman and her son there was a seven-year famine. So at least seven years passes and the Shunammite

00:50:00.299 --> 00:50:05.139
This giant woman and her son are referenced in chapter number 8.

00:50:05.139 --> 00:50:10.439
God gave her opportunity to see her son grow and live.

00:50:10.439 --> 00:50:16.559
I don't know how long, there's no more reference with regard to either one of them after chapter number 8,

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:26.999
but I find this morning, this great woman in Shunem, she was caring, she was generous, she was content.

00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:34.799
I find that she was blessed, she was broken, and then she was privileged to see God work.

00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:40.339
I think about that last point this morning, you know it's a privilege for us to see God work.

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:43.139
It's a privilege, unique privilege.

00:50:43.139 --> 00:50:45.719
Do you long to see God work in your life?

00:50:45.719 --> 00:50:50.179
Do you long to see God work in the lives of those that He's given you opportunity to,

00:50:50.179 --> 00:50:57.679
if you're parents, to raise, if you're church members, to minister to, you want to see God work in their lives.

00:50:57.679 --> 00:51:00.419
It's a privilege to see God work.

00:51:00.419 --> 00:51:04.759
We've got to be in the right place if we're going to see God work.

00:51:04.759 --> 00:51:10.559
You know what led to this Shunemite woman seeing God work in all the circumstances in which she did?

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:17.839
It started out by her being caring and saying, constrained him to eat some bread,

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:21.199
and then perceiving that this was a holy man of God and said,

00:51:21.199 --> 00:51:27.579
we need to build a place for him to be able to stay so that when he passes through here, he'll stay here.

00:51:27.579 --> 00:51:33.179
He could have stayed somewhere else, someone else could, but no, she had the opportunity and she seized it.

00:51:33.179 --> 00:51:43.019
And because of that single decision, her generosity, her service, her care, she got to see God work miraculously.

00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:48.679
I hope this morning that we would not allow opportunities to pass us by, that we would seize them,

00:51:48.679 --> 00:51:54.359
that we'd be used of the Lord, that we would see God do great and mighty things.

00:51:54.359 --> 00:52:04.639
It's God who said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:07.999
If you're broken today, can I give you hope in Christ?

00:52:07.999 --> 00:52:12.039
Can I tell you that Jesus, He heals the brokenhearted.

00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:13.999
What a wonderful, wonderful Savior we have.

00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:19.239
If you don't know Him as your personal Lord and Savior today, today is the day of salvation.

00:52:19.239 --> 00:52:28.019
This morning you say, I'm a Christian, I'm saved by the grace of God, but I got this burden, I'm broken over this situation.

00:52:28.019 --> 00:52:31.319
Tell it to Jesus. Tell it to Jesus.

00:52:31.319 --> 00:52:33.779
What a privilege we have.

00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:39.059
What a friend we have in Jesus that we can go to Him knowing that He cares for us.

00:52:39.059 --> 00:52:39.699
Let's pray together.

00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:40.499
Father, we love you.

00:52:40.499 --> 00:52:41.599
We thank you for loving us.

00:52:41.619 --> 00:52:46.759
Thank you for the opportunity today to celebrate mothers.

00:52:46.759 --> 00:52:51.159
Thank you for this Shunammite woman.

00:52:51.159 --> 00:52:54.739
Lord, thank you for the characteristics that we could look at of her life.

00:52:54.739 --> 00:52:56.239
Thank you for what you revealed to us.

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:59.299
I pray, God, that you'd meet needs this morning.

00:52:59.299 --> 00:53:00.739
Maybe there's someone that's broken.

00:53:00.739 --> 00:53:10.759
God, would you just help them to run to you, to get into your presence, to not leave your presence, to abide in you.

00:53:10.779 --> 00:53:17.619
Lord, I pray that you would work miraculously in our lives, that we would seize the opportunities to serve you.

00:53:17.619 --> 00:53:25.299
Not for something that we might be able to get, but Lord, that we would serve you because you are worthy of our service.

00:53:25.299 --> 00:53:28.699
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as only you can.

00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:34.199
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:53:34.199 --> 00:53:37.099
Well, thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:37.099 --> 00:53:37.939
Would you stand with me?

00:53:37.939 --> 00:53:39.779
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:42.599
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:53:42.599 --> 00:53:46.679
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:49.919
If you're saved, then maybe you just need to come and talk to the Lord this morning.

00:53:49.919 --> 00:53:57.399
Maybe there's something that's on your heart, you're broken, you're in need of God's care and God's grace.

00:53:57.399 --> 00:53:59.639
Maybe God spoke to you through some other way this morning.

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:01.639
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
