1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
evening, Acts chapter number 11, Acts chapter number 11, and I would say for our text this

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,119
evening, if you're taking notes, that we'll be looking at verses 19 through 26 of Acts

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,520
chapter number 11, but the truth be told, we're going to go forward through the next

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,559
couple of chapters of the book of Acts and pick out a few things that take place.

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,239
And really, as we look at this passage of Scripture this evening, and then look at a

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,440
few additional portions of the book of Acts, I really want to spend a few moments tonight

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,560
and consider the church in Antioch.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,159
And it's interesting, if we were to be asked, if someone were to ask you or ask me, what

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,080
do you know about the church in Antioch?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,419
Certainly, if you've read the Bible, if you've been around church for any length of time,

11
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:51,319
there are some things that you might be able to say about the church in Antioch, and one

12
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:55,580
of the answers that might be given with regard to the church in Antioch is they were first

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,520
called Christians in Antioch, and you would be correct, and maybe someone would say something

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,260
to the effect of being the church that sent out the first missionaries, and you would

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,260
be correct.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,139
And certainly, there's some information that we know about the church of Antioch, and as

17
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:15,260
I was just kind of meditating upon this church and really thinking about the church in Antioch

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,800
and beginning to allow myself to just think about and to see what the Lord says in His

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,000
word about this church, I was encouraged, but I was also challenged.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,720
I believe that there is no perfect church.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,160
I do not believe that there's a perfect church.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,400
I believe that there are churches that seek to obey God and seek to follow God, churches

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,080
that maybe we would say are model churches, are exemplary in their behavior and their

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
conduct.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,839
And I would say this evening that the church at Antioch, the church in Antioch, would be

26
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,879
such a church.

27
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,919
I believe that as we study and look through the pages of Scripture that God gives us with

28
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:01,319
regard to this church, we would say they were doing things well.

29
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,000
They were serving the Lord, and that's commendable.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,239
That's exemplary.

31
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,279
I find that as I would think about the church in Antioch, there really isn't a ton that

32
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,919
we know about the church, biblically speaking.

33
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,440
There's no letter written to the church in Antioch.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,240
There's no, you know, big dissortation that God gives us, but we are given some information

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,039
that would help us to be encouraged and help us to be challenged.

36
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,199
I think about this.

37
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,880
If you notice in verse number 26, the last part of the verse, it says, and the disciples

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,679
were called Christians first in Antioch.

39
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:43,679
And honestly, it was that phrase of Scripture that really caught my attention and caused

40
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:51,199
me to begin to meditate upon this thought that really was the start of this message

41
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,960
for this evening.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
And that's this.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:02,559
What was it about these believers, these disciples, that made them be called Christians?

44
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,479
What was it about this group of people?

45
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,880
And as we begin to look at the Scriptures, and I begin to make note of some things about

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,440
these believers, I hope this evening that you would be encouraged like I have been.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,639
I pray that we would be challenged corporately and individually as I have been challenged

48
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,240
through considering these few things about this church in Antioch.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,919
If I were to give a title for the message this evening, it would simply be that statement,

50
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,360
the disciples were called Christians.

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,839
The disciples were called Christians.

52
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:46,839
Now, the word disciple is simply, it refers to a pupil, a person, a learner.

53
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:52,279
And we find that we would refer to the disciples, the twelve disciples, we would refer to Peter

54
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:56,880
and John and those fellas as being the disciples of Christ, and rightly so.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,279
And Jesus would say, if any men are going to follow me, here's what he has to do to

56
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:04,479
be a disciple of mine, and so on and so forth.

57
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:12,800
We find that the word Christian means to be a follower of Christ.

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,700
Jesus said, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

59
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,040
We find that Peter would later say in the book of 1 Peter that Jesus left us an example

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,720
that you should follow his steps.

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:35,279
The reality is that as New Testament believers in 2021, we have the responsibility, shall

62
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,440
I say we have the privilege, of being followers of Jesus Christ.

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,279
And what a tremendous blessing it is to be a follower of Christ, and to determine that

64
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,079
we're going to follow him.

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:56,399
We sing songs about following Jesus, and we sing about I have decided to follow Jesus.

66
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,279
It's a song that we sing with children, and we encourage them in their Sunday school classes,

67
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,279
in their junior churches, in their Awana meetings, to learn about following Jesus.

68
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:12,399
I would say this, that we've been instructed to follow Jesus, and it is our right and our

69
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,320
privilege to be able to serve him and to follow him, and what joy it is.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,720
But I would say this, Jesus never told us that it would be easy to follow Christ.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,079
He never said that it would be easy to follow him.

72
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,760
In fact, if you were to read the record of what I mentioned a moment ago in Mark's gospel,

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,000
we'll look at what he says with regard to this truth.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,679
In Mark chapter number 8, in verse number 34, the Bible says,

75
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:49,119
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them,

76
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:59,399
Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

77
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,880
Jesus never said that it would be easy to follow him.

78
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,399
I think of Caleb and Joshua.

79
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,839
I think of Caleb as it says often of him in the Old Testament, that he wholly followed

80
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,359
the Lord his God, completely.

81
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,279
He wholly followed the Lord his God.

82
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,640
It wasn't easy for Joshua and Caleb to follow the Lord.

83
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,559
It wasn't popular.

84
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:27,600
Following Jesus, what a joy, what a blessing.

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,279
But it's not always easy.

86
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,399
It's not always popular.

87
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,679
But we find something about these believers in Antioch.

88
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:42,100
We find that these disciples were called Christians because they were followers of Christ.

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,500
As we dig in and make some observations this evening about this church, I want you to notice

90
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,380
first of all how this church was established, or maybe I should say when this church was

91
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,700
established.

92
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,540
Look in Acts chapter 11, beginning in verse 19 and down through verse number 22, and we'll

93
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,859
see the establishment of this church.

94
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:07,179
The Bible says, Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about

95
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:13,220
Stephen traveled as far as Phineas and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to none but

96
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
unto the Jews only.

97
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,579
And so as we look at verse number 19 of Acts chapter 11, the historical context, we find

98
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,140
the connection given to us back to Acts chapter number 8.

99
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:32,140
We know at the end of Acts chapter number 7, the chapter just records for us the sermon

100
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,980
of Stephen and then, of course, the stoning of Stephen.

101
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,859
When you come into Acts chapter number 8, and the Bible tells us that the persecution

102
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:46,059
intensified in verse number 1, and Saul was consenting unto his death, and at that time

103
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:51,220
there was a great persecution against the church, which was at Jerusalem, and they were

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,980
all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles.

105
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,700
And I want you to notice, the Bible says in verse number 4 of Acts chapter number 8, Therefore

106
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:10,140
they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.

107
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:16,940
So the connection is given to us in Acts 11 and verse number 19, that these individuals

108
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,940
that were scattered abroad because of the persecution, that they traveled as far as

109
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,059
Phineas, Cyprus, and Antioch, they were preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

110
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:30,660
Now notice in verse number 20, And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which

111
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:40,260
when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, notice, preaching the Lord Jesus.

112
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,460
Now I'm thankful for the preaching of the cross.

113
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm thankful for the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

114
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,479
I'm thankful that as we think about this city of Antioch, that prior to the events really

115
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,179
that are recorded in these few verses of Scripture, there was no church in Antioch.

116
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,260
There was no group of believers.

117
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,940
You would not be able to go down and find a church in Antioch prior to the events that

118
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,700
are recorded in this portion of Scripture that we're reading this evening.

119
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,659
The city, though it was well populated, though they were engaged in trade because of the

120
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,739
particular region in which they were located, I mean, really this was a cosmopolitan center.

121
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,880
I mean, it was a happening place.

122
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,140
The city of Antioch was a pretty large city at this particular time.

123
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,580
Estimates are that they would have a population of near half a million people, but yet they

124
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,140
were in darkness.

125
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,219
They were in darkness.

126
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:49,700
And then, because of something that happened in Jerusalem, nearly 300 miles away, because

127
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:56,419
of the persecution that arose and because of the scattering of the believers, the gospel

128
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,020
was going forward.

129
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,059
God bless you.

130
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,299
God's plan was being fulfilled.

131
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,059
And we find that the Bible says

132
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,559
that they came and they were

133
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,899
preaching the Lord Jesus

134
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,199
and v. 21 of Acts 11,

135
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,779
and the hand of the Lord was with them.

136
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,959
Now, I want you to take great comfort in that.

137
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,479
For remember, even as we looked at this morning

138
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,019
as we spoke about the importance

139
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,179
of the Great Commission

140
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,019
and understand that the Great Commission

141
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,019
is our mission,

142
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,899
that Jesus Himself gave the promise

143
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,059
that I will be with thee.

144
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,539
And here the Bible says

145
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,099
that the hand of the Lord was with them.

146
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,059
Notice, in a great number,

147
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,259
believed and turned unto the Lord.

148
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,579
Hallelujah.

149
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,939
I mean, people were saved.

150
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,099
The Bible doesn't even give us a number.

151
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,859
It just says a great number believed.

152
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,219
We don't know the size of this conversion

153
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,779
of this church at this time.

154
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,379
We don't know the number,

155
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,459
but we know that the Holy Spirit of God

156
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,379
as He would give the Scriptures

157
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,779
gave for us to understand

158
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,379
that it was a great number that believed.

159
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,180
Once again, the evidence of the truth

160
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,619
that we looked at this morning

161
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,459
from Colossians 1,

162
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,739
that the Gospel does produce fruit.

163
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,379
They went in there preaching Christ,

164
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,259
preaching the Lord Jesus,

165
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,939
and the hand of the Lord was with them

166
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,860
a great number believed

167
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,579
and turned unto the Lord.

168
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,180
Oh, I hope as we begin to think about

169
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,379
this church that was being established,

170
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,619
I hope that it caused you to rejoice greatly

171
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,819
when you read these verses of Scripture

172
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,819
and consider that in this city,

173
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,220
in this location,

174
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,180
though they had commerce,

175
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,579
though they had entertainment,

176
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,500
though they had all of the things

177
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,379
that a city would have at that particular time,

178
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,180
they were in darkness.

179
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,779
The light of the Gospel

180
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,059
through the preaching of the Word of God

181
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,379
enters into this city

182
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,019
and people get saved.

183
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,779
Lives are changed.

184
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,220
News spreads to the church in Jerusalem.

185
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,419
Notice in verse 22,

186
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,300
the Bible says,

187
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,899
"...then tidings of these things

188
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,819
came unto the ears of the church

189
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:17,419
which was in Jerusalem."

190
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,259
What did they do?

191
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,419
Well, they sent forth Barnabas

192
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,339
that he should go as far as Antioch.

193
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,300
Barnabas goes to Antioch

194
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,539
and as we'll look here in just a few moments

195
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,580
on the next few verses,

196
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,699
we see the ministry of Barnabas there in Antioch

197
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,940
and see how God would use this man.

198
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,739
Of course, we know that he was a great encourager

199
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,459
as we would be introduced to him

200
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,619
and really understand several things about Barnabas

201
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,339
in previous chapters of the book of Acts

202
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,739
and what a man that God would use.

203
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:50,099
And these believers at the church at Jerusalem,

204
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:52,300
when they heard about what was taking place

205
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,099
and the salvation of many souls

206
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,739
and all that was going forth,

207
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,300
they sent forth Barnabas.

208
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,660
So we know that this church was established

209
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,020
because of the scattering of those

210
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,779
that were facing persecution.

211
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,339
The preaching of the Word of God goes forward.

212
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,940
God's plan is being fulfilled.

213
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,819
See, the reality is that perhaps

214
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,739
for those in Acts 8

215
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:22,380
and even those that were enduring

216
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,860
that hardness of that persecution,

217
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,500
perhaps they would look at it as being a negative thing.

218
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,580
A woe is me type of a syndrome.

219
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,339
I can't believe we're dealing with these things.

220
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,459
We understand that God was working through that.

221
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,259
God was fulfilling His plan

222
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,739
to get the Word of God beyond Jerusalem.

223
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,619
We find that in Acts 1 and verse 8,

224
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:46,580
He had given the instruction to the disciples

225
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,899
that they should receive power

226
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,860
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

227
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,459
You shall be witnesses unto Me

228
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,940
both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria

229
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

230
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,979
They were not supposed to stay in Jerusalem.

231
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:00,020
They were to spread forth.

232
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,699
The enemy sought to stamp out the Gospel, if you will.

233
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,899
And as one theologian of yesteryear put it,

234
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,899
they spread the embers all over the world.

235
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,539
And what joy!

236
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:15,179
I think that these folks in Antioch

237
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,380
were certainly delighted

238
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,940
that these that were scattered abroad

239
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,739
came and preached the Gospel.

240
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,579
The church was established.

241
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,260
I notice not only when they were established,

242
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,619
but I notice how they were instructed.

243
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,019
Notice with me in v. 23-26

244
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,339
the instruction that this church received.

245
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,579
The Bible says who?

246
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,100
Speaking of Barnabas in v. 22,

247
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,779
when he came and had seen the grace of God.

248
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,700
Isn't that an interesting statement of Scripture?

249
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,579
The Bible says that he had seen the grace of God.

250
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,700
The evidence of God's grace was seen to Barnabas.

251
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,779
It was visible.

252
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:56,139
He saw how God was working,

253
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,899
what God was doing in this place

254
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,980
and in the lives of these individuals.

255
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,980
The Bible says that he was glad.

256
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,220
I mean, that's a simple statement of Scripture,

257
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,299
but how we should understand the rejoicing

258
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,380
that we ought to have when we hear

259
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,940
about souls that are being saved,

260
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,419
about the Gospel that's going forth,

261
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,660
the churches that are being established,

262
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,500
what joy.

263
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,380
It says that he was glad and exhorted them all.

264
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,980
Notice how he exhorted them

265
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
that with purpose of heart,

266
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,660
they would cleave unto the Lord.

267
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,179
I like that word, cleave.

268
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,940
It's a good Bible word.

269
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,579
In fact, Joshua, if you were to read

270
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,260
the charges of Joshua at the end of the book of Joshua,

271
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,579
he would charge those that he was called to lead,

272
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,859
he would charge them to cleave unto the Lord.

273
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:53,540
This word cleave, it carries with it the idea

274
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,179
to hold fast to, to continue with,

275
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,500
to abide, to cling or stick to.

276
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,419
Isn't that great verbiage?

277
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,540
I mean, the picture in your mind

278
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,019
that you receive when you understand

279
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,220
how that he, Barnabas, would exhort

280
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,980
these new believers in Christ in Antioch,

281
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,579
this new church that's now being established,

282
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,940
that he says that they would cleave unto the Lord.

283
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Oh, that they would continue with, hold fast.

284
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,299
I mean, grab hold of, cling to,

285
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:30,899
stick to the Lord.

286
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,019
What a blessing.

287
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:35,700
What great instruction.

288
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,139
We find that the Bible tells us in verse 24,

289
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,380
he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.

290
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,339
What a great testimony Barnabas had.

291
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,660
He was a spiritual man.

292
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,380
He was filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

293
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,100
He was a man of faith.

294
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,940
The Bible says, and much people was added unto the Lord.

295
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,380
You see, it's a growing church.

296
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,980
I mean, this is the way it's supposed to be.

297
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,100
A church is supposed to grow.

298
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,660
A church is a living organism.

299
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,260
We think about a church growing

300
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,179
and the church seeing people saved

301
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,619
and discipled and instructed.

302
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,179
Man, that's what it's about.

303
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm encouraged, but I'm challenged.

304
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,899
I mean, I'm challenged because my desire

305
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,700
to see the waters of baptism stirred.

306
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,220
Why? Because we have new people

307
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,019
that are being saved that are walking the aisle

308
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,700
and souls that are being saved

309
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,260
and lives that are being changed.

310
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,859
Homes that are being helped

311
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:33,579
and children that are seeing their parents saved

312
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,820
and their lives changed.

313
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,179
I mean, it's amazing.

314
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,540
And I'm challenged by it because it's our duty,

315
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,739
it's our job, it's our responsibility

316
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,339
to go and to preach the gospel

317
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:43,779
and to see people saved

318
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,739
and to see people added unto the church

319
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:49,500
and to see the work of God going forward.

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,220
The Bible says much people was added unto the Lord.

321
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,260
Barnabas recognized the work

322
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,139
that was taking place here in Antioch

323
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:01,540
and he recognized very quickly

324
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,700
that it was too much for him.

325
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,660
He needed some help.

326
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,899
The Bible tells us in verse number 25,

327
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:12,899
then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek Saul.

328
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,500
Now Saul, of course, would become Paul

329
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,779
in just a few chapters.

330
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,820
In fact, his name will be changed.

331
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,179
We know that a few chapters before

332
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,339
in Acts chapter number nine, that Saul is saved.

333
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,660
He's converted.

334
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,459
And we know that after his conversion,

335
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,940
that there's some work there with Barnabas

336
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,179
and how Barnabas took him

337
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:34,460
and brought him to the apostles

338
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,059
according to Acts nine in verse number 27.

339
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,659
And so Barnabas sees the work.

340
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,140
He sees what's taking place.

341
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,020
He's instructing these people,

342
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,299
but there's so many of them.

343
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,219
There's so much work that needs to be done.

344
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,500
He says, I need help.

345
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,219
And he goes and he heads to Tarsus.

346
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:52,059
And the Bible says that he went to seek Saul.

347
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,580
And when he had found him,

348
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,380
he brought him unto Antioch.

349
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,219
And so now we see that Barnabas and Saul

350
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,619
are both in Antioch

351
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,900
and they're both ministering in Antioch.

352
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,099
And the Bible says that it came to pass,

353
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:07,340
notice what it says,

354
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,859
that a whole year they assembled themselves

355
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,859
with the church and taught much people for a year.

356
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,299
They were being instructed.

357
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,299
I believe that as these believers were assembled

358
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,380
for the purpose of receiving this instruction,

359
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,460
I believe that they were growing in Christ.

360
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,299
Hold your place here and look

361
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,340
to 1 Peter 2 and we'll look

362
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,260
at 2 Peter 3 as well.

363
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,779
But I want you to understand

364
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,979
that as a believer, as a Christian,

365
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,820
not only is the church to be growing,

366
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,419
but individually as a believer,

367
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,659
you're to be growing.

368
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,900
We understand growth physically speaking.

369
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,659
We understand growth when we speak about it

370
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:58,859
maybe from a...

371
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,499
a career perspective, and what have you.

372
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:04,839
We want to have some professional development,

373
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,079
some professional growth.

374
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,139
But I wonder this evening how much time and effort

375
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:15,159
and recognition we put into spiritual growth.

376
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,119
How is it that we monitor

377
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,879
and how is it that we gauge our spiritual growth?

378
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:24,519
We ought to be growing in Christ.

379
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,599
Do you have a plan to grow?

380
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,139
Do you have a desire to grow?

381
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,539
We find here that the Bible says in 1 Peter 2

382
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:33,439
in verse 2,

383
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,079
"...as newborn babes,

384
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,179
desire the sincere milk of the Word

385
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,159
that ye may grow thereby."

386
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,359
Peter would say in 2 Peter 3

387
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,819
in verse 18,

388
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,419
"...but grow in grace,

389
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,999
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

390
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,199
to Him be glory both now and forever.

391
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,239
Amen."

392
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,599
I don't ever want to get stagnant.

393
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,519
I don't want to get to a place where I feel like,

394
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,759
well, this is far enough.

395
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,899
I'm really not interested in going any further.

396
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,139
No, that we would say as Paul said

397
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,799
when he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

398
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,239
and I mean I hear the heart cry of the Apostle Paul

399
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,319
when he says in Philippians 3 in v. 10,

400
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,799
that I may know Him

401
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,679
and the power of His resurrection

402
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,479
and the fellowship of His sufferings

403
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,359
being made conformable unto His death.

404
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,679
Paul desired to know Christ in a more intimate way

405
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,799
to grow closer in his walk with Christ.

406
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,199
I don't want to be satisfied

407
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,399
with how my walk with Christ is.

408
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,799
I want it to be better.

409
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,079
I want to grow closer to Him.

410
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,999
And I believe that these new believers in Antioch,

411
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,319
they were growing in Christ.

412
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,459
They were being taught.

413
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:55,219
Barnabas and Saul.

414
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,259
They were engaged in teaching the Word.

415
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,779
Instructing these believers.

416
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,059
I believe not only were they growing in Christ,

417
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,859
but I believe they were living for Christ.

418
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,699
They were living for Christ.

419
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,419
You know the responsibility to live for Him

420
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,259
who died for us.

421
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,459
I'm mindful of the testimony of the Apostle Paul.

422
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,019
In fact, if you've received any kind of correspondence

423
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,339
from me over the years,

424
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,299
I sign cards each birthday and anniversary card

425
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,979
that I send, each thank you note,

426
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,699
each note of encouragement, my emails.

427
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,979
Because of Calvary, and I sign a verse,

428
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:34,379
2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 15.

429
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:35,819
It's in that verse of Scripture

430
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,379
that the Apostle Paul says,

431
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,339
and that he died for all,

432
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:43,259
that they which live should not henceforth

433
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:45,419
live unto themselves,

434
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:51,419
but unto Him which died for them and rose again.

435
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,859
Living for Jesus, the songwriter said.

436
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,339
It's a long song.

437
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,179
We don't sing it that often.

438
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,659
But oh, it's a powerful song.

439
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,379
I believe that these believers,

440
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:06,019
these disciples as they're referred to here,

441
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,019
I believe that they were living for Jesus.

442
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,659
They were living for Christ.

443
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,059
They were taking that instruction

444
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,059
that they were receiving.

445
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,739
I mean, can you put your mind there in Antioch

446
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,299
and can you see what has transpired in this last year?

447
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,659
You understand that in this bustling city,

448
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,499
this cosmopolitan, half a million people,

449
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:24,859
I mean, they had the commerce,

450
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,419
they had all of the things

451
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,899
that a city at that time would have,

452
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:31,619
but they were in darkness.

453
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,779
There was no church that was preaching the gospel.

454
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,019
And then these believers that were scattered abroad

455
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,179
come in and they begin to preach the gospel,

456
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,339
and souls are saved, lives are changed.

457
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,059
They set up shop and Paul and Barnabas,

458
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,379
they're teaching, they're instructing.

459
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:49,819
But as we understand the whole of Scripture,

460
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,179
the Bible teaches us that we're to be doers of the Word,

461
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:54,539
not hearers only.

462
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,659
No doubt in my mind that as Barnabas

463
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:01,619
and Paul sat there day after day

464
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,339
in giving instruction to these believers in Antioch,

465
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,339
that they were giving them the challenge

466
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,579
to go live your faith.

467
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,939
To go out into the community.

468
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:16,339
To be a Christian.

469
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,299
They weren't called Christians yet.

470
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,379
It's just about to be coined that phrase,

471
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:21,619
that terminology.

472
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,979
But in our vernacular,

473
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:28,500
the understanding that we would go forth

474
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,019
and that we would do as Jesus said,

475
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,539
that we would let our light so shine before men

476
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,019
that they may see our good works

477
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,299
and glorify our Father which is in heaven,

478
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:42,659
that we would shine as bright in lights,

479
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,099
burning lights, excuse me,

480
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,500
in this dark and wicked world.

481
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,219
I believe they were instructed

482
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:53,139
and they were encouraged, go live your faith.

483
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,259
What a joy it is to fellowship with the believers

484
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,579
in the house of God.

485
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,299
But we need to enter into the mission field.

486
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:08,299
Nearly every time Brother Dean closes a service in prayer,

487
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,899
he'll say something to the effect of,

488
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:13,819
as we enter into the mission field.

489
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,699
What a great reminder.

490
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:19,339
In fact, I remember as a teenager,

491
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:21,219
I remember seeing in a church

492
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,099
in which we had visited for a period of time

493
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,819
where they had above the door

494
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,299
leaving the teen Sunday school class,

495
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,619
you now enter the mission field.

496
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,779
And it was a reminder each time we left that class

497
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,099
that we're leaving the class

498
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,339
and we were to take whatever we had been given

499
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,500
as far as instruction is concerned

500
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,539
and to go out and live our faith,

501
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,099
living for Jesus.

502
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,619
I believe that as I would look at the passage of Scripture

503
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,619
and I would see what was happening during this year,

504
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,979
how that for a whole year,

505
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:56,859
they assembled themselves with the church

506
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,219
and taught much people.

507
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,539
And then the Bible says this,

508
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,019
and the disciples were called Christians

509
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,939
first in Antioch.

510
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,099
They were called Christians, followers of Christ.

511
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,539
As they lived their faith,

512
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,179
as they practiced what they had been taught,

513
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,059
as they were doers of the Word,

514
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:29,579
these disciples were called Christians.

515
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:30,779
They're like Christ.

516
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,179
They are followers of Christ.

517
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,339
See, today, the word Christian is used very loosely,

518
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,419
to be honest.

519
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:46,059
It's very easy for people to say, I'm a Christian.

520
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,059
What do you mean by that?

521
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,619
What do you mean when you say that I'm a Christian?

522
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,539
I mean, I understand that we sing a song,

523
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,379
I am a Christian.

524
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,299
We sing that with the kids and have fun

525
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,500
and so on and so forth.

526
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,219
But truly, we think about what a Christian is,

527
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,099
a follower of Jesus Christ.

528
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,339
I wonder, as some have said in the past,

529
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:11,459
and I think it's a sobering thought,

530
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,379
would there be enough evidence

531
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:19,179
to convict you of being a Christian?

532
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,059
If you were brought before a jury,

533
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,500
a court of law,

534
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,219
and the accusation against you is that you are a Christian,

535
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:37,219
would there be enough evidence to bring forth a conviction?

536
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,259
Wow, that's a sobering thought.

537
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,099
It's not original with me, but it's a sobering thought.

538
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:50,579
They were called Christians first in Antioch.

539
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,539
Notice with me, skip, if you will, to chapter 13.

540
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,739
Notice what the Bible tells us about these believers.

541
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:01,779
Again, it's not a lot of time that's passed

542
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,979
from the first entrance of the Gospel into their city.

543
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,739
I mean, we know that the Bible tells us

544
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:11,259
that for a year, Paul and Barnabas are teaching them,

545
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,019
and really, that's not a long time.

546
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,699
That's a blessing for sure,

547
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,939
but it's not years and years.

548
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:19,939
It's a short period of time.

549
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,179
In chapter 13, in verses one and two,

550
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,859
the Bible tells us a little bit more about this church

551
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:26,139
and what they were doing.

552
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,739
It says, now they were in the church that was at Antioch,

553
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,700
certain prophets and teachers, as Barnabas and Simeon,

554
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,539
that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaan,

555
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,539
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

556
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,579
Notice what it says in verse number two.

557
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:44,579
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted.

558
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,779
They ministered to the Lord and fasted.

559
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,619
I said that they were growing in Christ.

560
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,260
I believe they were living for Christ.

561
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,700
They were serving God.

562
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,739
They were serving the Lord.

563
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,659
They were ministering to the Lord.

564
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,140
And the Bible says that they fasted.

565
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,739
We'll see this a couple of times

566
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:04,739
in these verses of Scripture with regard to their fasting.

567
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:07,899
It's not the main focus of the message this evening,

568
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:10,700
but it is noteworthy that we'd understand

569
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,419
the practice of fasting and the importance of fasting.

570
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,539
And the Bible tells us that these believers were fasting.

571
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:23,579
As we look and trace the steps of this church in Antioch,

572
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,659
we notice, first of all, when the church was established.

573
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,260
We notice how they were instructed.

574
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,940
Now I want you to notice their obedience.

575
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,859
Notice their obedience.

576
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,940
I find it exciting to see what happens here

577
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,739
in Acts chapter number 13,

578
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:41,500
as I think about the importance of obeying God.

579
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,659
As I think about the importance of following the Lord.

580
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,619
See, the disciples were called Christians.

581
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,739
The disciples were called Christians.

582
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:51,739
They were called followers of Christ,

583
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:54,059
that they were going to be obedient,

584
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,179
that they were going to follow.

585
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:57,979
I think about Joshua and Caleb, as we mentioned,

586
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,019
in our introduction.

587
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:01,059
and this evening there in the Old Testament

588
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,219
and the whole situation with the spies that went in

589
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,479
and to spy out the land and they came back

590
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:08,039
and there were 12 of them,

591
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,039
and it was simply Joshua and Caleb that believed God

592
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,099
and they were willing to follow God.

593
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:15,139
They were willing to obey God.

594
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,939
The other 10, they say, no, we're not willing.

595
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,059
I mean, there's giants there and there's this problem

596
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,979
and that problem and there are fortified cities

597
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,459
and so on and so forth.

598
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:25,219
And Joshua and Caleb, they're ready to rent their clothes

599
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:27,819
and they say, if God is for us.

600
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,099
See, it was just a matter of obedience for them.

601
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,859
It was just a matter of we're following the Lord

602
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:35,359
and we're going to obey the Lord.

603
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,779
We sing the song, trust and obey.

604
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,739
Listen, our God is trustworthy

605
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,699
and it is always in our best interest to obey Him.

606
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:52,139
Always in our best interest to obey Him.

607
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,459
And we know their obedience.

608
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,699
The Bible says in Acts 13 and verse two,

609
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,419
it says, as they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

610
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,339
the Holy Ghost said,

611
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:11,259
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

612
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,979
whereunto I have called them.

613
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,459
A very specific instruction.

614
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:21,939
The instruction of God in verse number two,

615
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:25,939
it is not only clear, simple,

616
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:30,059
I mean, we see that He says,

617
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,939
the Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul

618
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:37,339
for the work whereunto I have called them.

619
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,899
I mean, there's no room for misinterpretation.

620
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,139
Who is it that's supposed to go?

621
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:46,379
God made it clear.

622
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:49,019
Barnabas and Saul for the work

623
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,459
whereunto I have called them.

624
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,219
I want you to notice as we think about the instruction

625
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:55,379
in verse number two,

626
00:31:55,379 --> 00:32:00,379
we know the simplicity and the directness

627
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,659
of this instruction,

628
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:07,659
but I want you to think about the role of Barnabas and Saul.

629
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,019
I want you to think about it just for a moment

630
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,719
from a human perspective.

631
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:19,219
And I want you to take note and to rejoice

632
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:23,159
in the response of these believers in Antioch,

633
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,859
because there are times in our lives

634
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,439
when we lean on our own understanding.

635
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,519
Certainly it would have been easy for them

636
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,879
to lean on their own understanding

637
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:34,399
in this particular situation.

638
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,679
I mean, Saul and Barnabas, they're our teachers.

639
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:41,599
They're the ones that have been instructing us

640
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,219
every day for the last year.

641
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,519
And you want to separate them?

642
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,839
You have another work for them?

643
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,719
But they're here.

644
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,199
Trust in the Lord, how?

645
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,959
With all thine heart.

646
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,359
Lean not on thine own understanding,

647
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,879
in all thy ways acknowledge him

648
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,399
and he shall direct thy paths.

649
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,079
It's a church that was ministering to the Lord.

650
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,159
It was a growing church.

651
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:10,839
It was a serving church.

652
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,679
It was a church in which they had been instructed

653
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,199
and so on and so forth.

654
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:19,399
And now we see that they receive this specific command

655
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:24,399
from the Lord with regard to Barnabas and Saul

656
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,579
being separated for this work.

657
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:31,639
In verse number three, we note their obedience.

658
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:36,639
It says, and when they had fasted and prayed.

659
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,679
When they had fasted and prayed.

660
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,159
What a great response.

661
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:44,119
They fasted and they prayed.

662
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,479
They understood this was the will of the Lord.

663
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:50,239
It says, and laid their hands on them.

664
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:53,559
They sent them away.

665
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,839
I can only imagine from a human perspective,

666
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,279
the emotions that must have been experienced

667
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,779
on this moment, on this day, in this situation.

668
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,619
God created us as human beings to be emotional.

669
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,059
We have emotions.

670
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:14,059
And as they understood that it was the Lord

671
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,579
that had given this instruction,

672
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,419
they had a time of prayer and fasting

673
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:22,979
and they laid their hands on them and they sent them away

674
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:27,179
so that they could do the work that God called them to do.

675
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:31,219
The Bible says in verse number four,

676
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,779
so they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost,

677
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,859
departed unto Seleucia and from thence,

678
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:38,419
they sailed to Cyprus.

679
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,979
This would be, as we often refer to it as,

680
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:45,579
the first missionary journey.

681
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:49,319
I want you to think about that, the first.

682
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:52,499
That means it had not been done before, right?

683
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:53,659
We think about this thing,

684
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,859
oh yeah, we know they're gonna leave.

685
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,739
This is new.

686
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:59,339
This is the first century.

687
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,259
I mean, churches today, we're in 2021,

688
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:06,339
we've been receiving, we have the whole canon of Scripture.

689
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:10,039
We've received much instruction with regard to church.

690
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,819
This was early on in the first century.

691
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,179
I mean, the church moving forward,

692
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:20,019
the establishment of God's organism for this era of time

693
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,139
and we find that God's gonna say,

694
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:23,539
I want you to separate these guys

695
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,379
and I want you to send them.

696
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:28,579
And this is what we call the first missionary journey.

697
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,979
Now think about these believers in Antioch,

698
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:33,899
these disciples that were called Christians.

699
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,899
They followed Christ, they received the gospel

700
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:40,039
and they began to get instructed,

701
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,939
to get discipled, if you will,

702
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,699
and as they're being taught and as they're being challenged

703
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:46,899
and as they're receiving this instruction,

704
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:48,899
they're being taught that they're to live their faith,

705
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,059
they're to live for God,

706
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:52,779
they're to be doers of the word, not hearers only.

707
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:55,759
And Paul and Barnabas are investing in them

708
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:58,219
and teaching them and instructing them

709
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,299
and now they have the opportunity

710
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:02,099
because of their spiritual growth

711
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,659
that souls are being saved.

712
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,879
I mean, I don't know all that's going on in Antioch,

713
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:09,099
but it seems like a whole lot of good is going on in Antioch

714
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,319
and now all of a sudden, the Holy Spirit of God says,

715
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,959
I want to take these two men

716
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:16,599
and I want to send them over here.

717
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,919
And this church in Antioch has the opportunity,

718
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:22,039
the privilege of being the first church

719
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,079
to send forth missionaries.

720
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,519
Isn't that exciting?

721
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,879
It's exciting because they got involved

722
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,239
in what God was doing.

723
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,839
I mean, listen, no doubt there were a thousand reasons

724
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,339
why it didn't make sense from a human perspective.

725
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,999
That's what we get in trouble for.

726
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,419
We begin to sit around in our little committee meetings

727
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:44,539
and have these discussions as to why this can't happen

728
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:47,659
and why that can't happen and why we can't do this.

729
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:50,619
But we just simply need to get the mind of the Lord

730
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:53,859
and get involved with what God is doing.

731
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,359
Because with God, all things are possible.

732
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:03,059
All things are possible with God.

733
00:37:04,499 --> 00:37:06,499
He is the Lord God Almighty.

734
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:11,419
I was planning to preach from Genesis 17 this evening

735
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:16,379
when God did reveal Himself to Abraham in that fashion.

736
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:19,699
El Shaddai, I am the Lord God Almighty.

737
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:23,459
Listen, these believers in Antioch,

738
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:24,979
they had been instructed.

739
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:30,459
And they had been, I would say, properly instructed

740
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,259
and they're following Christ.

741
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,499
And they're believing that God is God

742
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:37,859
and He's able to do far exceeding

743
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,539
what they could even imagine.

744
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:43,759
They obey the Lord.

745
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,759
Notice with me their reunion.

746
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:49,219
We won't take the time to read the 13th

747
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:52,559
and 14th chapter of the book of Acts.

748
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:57,219
It's in these chapters that God details

749
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,959
the first missionary journey.

750
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,899
It's in that first missionary journey

751
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,019
when they went into the churches,

752
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,339
excuse me, into the region of Galatia.

753
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:09,299
We understand they went into the cities

754
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:11,059
of Antioch and Pisidia.

755
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:13,959
They went to Iconium, Lystra, Derbe.

756
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,539
It's all outlined there for you.

757
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,259
I would encourage you to go back and read

758
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,719
of how the gospel was going forth

759
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,099
and how the opportunities that Paul and Barnabas had

760
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,019
as they went and just all that took place

761
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,899
and how exciting to see what God was doing

762
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,219
and how God was working.

763
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,339
But we come to the end of the 14th chapter

764
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:40,699
of the book of Acts and we see,

765
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:44,459
we note their reunion or the reunion.

766
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:48,499
The reunion between the church in Antioch

767
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,939
and these missionaries.

768
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:56,119
Pick it up with me in Acts 14 in verse number 26.

769
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:56,959
The Bible says,

770
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,239
and then sailed to Antioch

771
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,399
from whence they had been recommended

772
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:07,399
to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

773
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,479
So thankful that they fulfilled the work

774
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,739
that they were given.

775
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:18,819
So thankful that now they're going to return

776
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:21,399
to what I would call the sending church.

777
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,359
The means and modes of communication today

778
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,939
vary greatly from that which these individuals experienced

779
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:30,639
and what they were familiar with.

780
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,919
And now all of a sudden the missionaries are coming home

781
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:38,639
and word spreads there's going to be this time of reunion.

782
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,279
It says in verse number 27,

783
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,699
and when they were come

784
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,939
and had gathered the church together.

785
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:49,879
I mean, I hope this evening

786
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:52,799
in your sanctified imagination

787
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:56,079
that you can see the excitement

788
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,539
of these believers gathering together.

789
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:07,039
No doubt in my mind, during the time of this missionary journey,

790
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,039
there were believers in Antioch that were praying.

791
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,039
They were praying.

792
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:20,039
They were praying that God would use these men in like manner

793
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,039
as those individuals were used that first came to Antioch.

794
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:29,039
It was real to them.

795
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,539
Somebody came into their city and brought the gospel.

796
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:36,539
And now they have the opportunity to be a conduit

797
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:43,039
and to send these guys to another city, cities, to preach the gospel.

798
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,039
Oh, how exciting.

799
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:52,539
I think when the Bible says in verse 27, this is, if you disagree, that's fine.

800
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,039
When it says when they would come and had gathered the church together,

801
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,539
I think there was a high level of excitement.

802
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:05,039
You ever come to a place, you come into a room and you just can feel the excitement?

803
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,539
I mean, it's just contagious, if you will.

804
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:13,539
Yeah, that's how I kind of picture this scene.

805
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:19,039
I picture it that people were eager to get there.

806
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,539
I'll come another time.

807
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:24,039
I don't think that was a common response.

808
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:27,039
I think they were excited to come, to hear.

809
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,039
They were personally invested.

810
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,039
And the Bible says, notice what it says in verse 27.

811
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,039
After the church has gathered together, notice what it says.

812
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:46,039
They rehearsed all that God had done with them

813
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:54,539
and how He, God, had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

814
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:58,539
I want you to go back and read Acts 13 and 14

815
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:04,039
so that you can understand what was rehearsed by Paul and Barnabas

816
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:07,039
when the church gathered together.

817
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,039
I think it was a joyous time.

818
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:17,039
I think it was a time in which individuals from this church

819
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,039
had the privilege of hearing how their prayers were answered,

820
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,039
how God was working.

821
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:30,539
I believe that this reunion that had extensive rehearsing

822
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,539
of all that God had done with them,

823
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:40,539
I think it led to a high level of rejoicing.

824
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:47,539
I think that they were rejoicing to hear of what God was doing

825
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,539
and how God was working.

826
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,539
It says in verse 28,

827
00:42:52,539 --> 00:43:02,539
and there they abode long time with the disciples.

828
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:08,539
To me, when you read verse 28,

829
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:14,539
I think it helps us to see the excitement that these believers had,

830
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:21,539
and it helps us to understand that they weren't eager to get out.

831
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,539
What do I mean by that?

832
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:27,539
They were rejoicing in what God was doing and what God had done,

833
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:33,539
and they were excited to be part of it.

834
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:38,539
And they abode there a long time with the disciples.

835
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:43,539
I'm not sure that anyone was,

836
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:47,539
alright Paul, you've got to wrap it up, you've only got a couple of minutes left.

837
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:50,539
I just don't picture that.

838
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,539
In fact, in just a little while, Paul's going to be preaching through the night,

839
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,539
and Eutychus is going to die because he was preaching so long.

840
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:02,539
They were there for a long time.

841
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,539
And I know that it says, and there they abode long time with the disciples.

842
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:08,539
It wasn't just a long meeting that they had,

843
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:10,539
there was time in which they stayed there.

844
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:13,539
In fact, if you look at the end of chapter number 15,

845
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,539
the Bible says in verse number 35,

846
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,539
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch,

847
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:21,539
teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also.

848
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,539
And so I understand that it was not just an initial meeting that was a lengthy time,

849
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:26,539
but I believe that it was.

850
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,539
They rehearsed everything that God was doing,

851
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:31,539
but then they were there and they were rejoicing together

852
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:37,539
and serving together and seeing God continue to use them.

853
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,539
I ask this evening,

854
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:42,539
how does a church get to a place

855
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,539
where the church in Antioch is at the end of Acts 14?

856
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:51,539
How do you get to the place where you're rejoicing

857
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,539
with those that have been sent out from your ministry,

858
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,539
rehearsing in all that God has done

859
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,539
or rejoicing as you're hearing the rehearsing of all that God has done,

860
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:06,539
or require some obedience to God?

861
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,539
It requires some instruction,

862
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:14,539
some growth,

863
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:17,539
some living for Christ.

864
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:20,539
And as we engage in those things,

865
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:26,539
and as we say we want to be a church that is able to rejoice

866
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:29,539
as we hear all that God has been doing,

867
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:33,539
then we need to follow the pattern that we see here

868
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:39,539
in these portions of Scripture about the church in Antioch.

869
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:45,539
It is my desire that God would use us

870
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:48,539
as Fellowship Baptist Church in a great and mighty way,

871
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:51,539
that we would impact our community in our world

872
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:54,539
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

873
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:59,539
It is my prayer that souls would be saved through our ministry,

874
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,539
that we would see the waters of baptism stirred,

875
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:08,539
that we would see people added unto the church,

876
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:12,539
that we would see people called from our midst

877
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,539
to go into ministry,

878
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,539
to serve in various capacities,

879
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:23,539
because they've learned to obey God.

880
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:27,539
They've learned to live for Christ.

881
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:30,539
The disciples were called Christians.

882
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,539
They were followers of Christ.

883
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:35,539
If someone were to ask you,

884
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,539
how do you identify yourself?

885
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:41,539
I know I said this in a sermon not long ago,

886
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,539
but I hope that we would say,

887
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,539
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

888
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,539
I'm a disciple of his,

889
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,539
a follower of Christ, a Christian.

890
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,539
This evening, I hope that you're encouraged

891
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,539
by looking at these passages of Scripture

892
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:00,539
about the church in Antioch.

893
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,539
But more than being encouraged,

894
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,539
I hope also that we would be challenged.

895
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,539
Are these things said about me personally

896
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:10,539
that are said about these believers personally?

897
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,539
Are these things said about us corporately

898
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,539
that are said about this church corporately?

899
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,539
Oh, that God would use us for his honor and for his glory.

900
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:21,539
The time is short.

901
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,539
We don't know how long we have.

902
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:27,539
But oh, that we would make every day count for Christ.

903
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:28,539
Father, we love you.

904
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:30,539
We thank you for loving us.

905
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,539
We thank you for the privilege of serving you.

906
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,539
God, as we look at this church in Antioch

907
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:41,539
and seek to be encouraged and challenged,

908
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:43,539
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would work

909
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:48,539
in each life as only He is able.

910
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,539
Take the Word of God and minister effectively

911
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,539
that decisions would be made that would please Thee.

912
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,539
We pray that you'd have your will and way

913
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,539
in our lives individually,

914
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,539
in our church corporately.

915
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,539
We pray that we'd obey you

916
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,539
and we thank you for it.

917
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:07,539
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
