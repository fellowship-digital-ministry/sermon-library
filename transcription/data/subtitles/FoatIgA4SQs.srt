1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
I am thankful for the Word of God, I'm thankful for the truth that God has given us in His

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,800
Word.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,399
Often, as we look at the Word of God, we find that God gives us, of course, truth that is

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:11,560
profitable for us.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,680
The Word of God tells us that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
We find that it's applicable in our lives.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,260
I'm so thankful that God's Word is not just a book of theory, but it's a book of application.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,280
We take the truth of God's Word and we put it into practice.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,979
We say, as Baptist people, that the Bible, the Word of God, is our sole authority for

10
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,939
faith and practice.

11
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,180
And what a joy to have the Word of God.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,040
The title for the message this morning is found in verse number 18 of our text of Scripture.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,500
The Bible says, My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,380
deed and in truth.

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,400
I've titled the message this morning, Love in Deed and in Truth.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,660
It's interesting, a recurring subject in the book of 1 John is that of brotherly love.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,480
We find that John first visited this particular subject matter in 1 John chapter number 2,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,440
verses 7 through 11.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,400
We find, as the Holy Spirit of God would have directed him to speak on the subject of brotherly

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,040
love, we found in that text of Scripture in 1 John chapter number 2, that the reality

21
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:28,660
the test that was given, the evidence that was provided of our love for the brethren,

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,180
it was a, it revealed to us, it was evidence that we were abiding in Christ, that we were

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,620
walking in fellowship with Christ.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,160
Remember, we mentioned that in 1 John chapter 1 and verse number 7, the theme for our year,

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,459
if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we will have fellowship one with another.

26
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,980
The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,879
We find that John continues in 1 John chapter number 2, and he says in verse number 10,

28
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,800
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,480
And the evidence, the evidence of abiding in the light, walking in the light, is that

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
we love the brethren.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,080
As we come to the third chapter of the book of 1 John, we see again that the subject of

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,839
brotherly love will be discussed.

33
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:20,639
We dealt with it just very briefly in a segue portion of verse number 10.

34
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,740
Last week we spoke about the sanctification, the growth of the child of God.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,300
It says in this, the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil, whosoever doeth

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,460
not righteousness is not of God.

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,100
But then notice this as he gets into the subject matter of brotherly love, neither he that

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,419
loveth not his brother.

39
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,940
And now we see in verses 11 through 18 that he's going to deal with this subject of brotherly

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,000
love.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,259
And here we discover that really, as we saw in chapter number 2, that it was an evidence

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,240
of fellowship with God, walking in the light, that here in chapter number 3 we discover

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,600
that loving the brethren, this brotherly love, is an evidence of conversion.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,199
It's an evidence of conversion.

45
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:12,880
And what a joy to understand how God is giving us this truth with regard to brotherly love.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,800
We find that this is not the last time that we will stop at this subject of brotherly

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,899
love as we study through the book of 1 John, for again in the fourth chapter, and really

48
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:27,779
into the very beginning of the fifth chapter, once again the Holy Spirit of God would prompt

49
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,979
John to write about this subject of brotherly love.

50
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,360
Now, the book of 1 John is only five chapters.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,139
It's not that long of a book.

52
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,580
But yet we see the subject of brotherly love coming up time and time again.

53
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,279
I believe that the Holy Spirit of God is trying to get our attention with the subject that

54
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,279
is before us.

55
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,580
See, Satan is a master at deceiving.

56
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,860
He's a master of dividing.

57
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,419
We find that as we study the church in Corinth, there was so much division and envy amongst

58
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:58,419
them.

59
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,119
There were fightings and all sorts of things going on.

60
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:05,759
The strife that is mentioned, the spiritual immaturity of the church in Corinth.

61
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,500
And we find that Satan is trying to divide the church.

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,020
And we find that even now, as we look at this subject matter this morning, and we think

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,420
about the importance of brotherly love, we think about what God tells us about loving

64
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,019
the brethren, we find the significance of this subject and how we must avoid giving

65
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,100
place to the enemy when it comes to division.

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,239
And the enemy wants to divide, and he wants to destroy, and he wants to get church members

67
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,440
fighting against church members and all sorts of things.

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,799
But we must understand that we have fervent charity, one toward another.

69
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:45,359
That's what Peter says in the book of 1 Peter, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

70
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,420
God, that we have fervent charity, one toward another.

71
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,920
As we look at the subject matter this morning, in verses 11 through 13, if you're taking

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,600
notes, I want you to notice first, what is to be expected.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,000
It's kind of interesting, as we go through the text of Scripture, he deals with the subject

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,519
of brotherly love, but there's an obvious contrast that is provided to us.

75
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,339
You'll recall in our message last Sunday morning, in verses 4 through 10, there was the contrast

76
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:15,299
that was provided there as well, as we looked at those that were doing righteousness versus

77
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:20,899
those that were not, and understanding that through their behavior, God is interested

78
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:26,339
in our behavior, that as we have been saved, as we have been born again, as we have been

79
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,140
declared righteous, that we are to live righteous lives.

80
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,540
And the contrast here in verses 11 through 18, as we find the contrast between love and

81
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,179
hate that is given to us, but notice what is to be expected.

82
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:44,140
In verse number 11, notice what the Apostle John says, under the inspiration of the Holy

83
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,739
Spirit of God, for this is the message that ye had heard from the beginning, that we should

84
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:53,059
love one another.

85
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:57,859
I would say this, love for the brethren is to be expected.

86
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:02,859
When we understand what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us, when we understand that we, at

87
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,940
that moment when we trusted Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, we were born again, and

88
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,899
we were born into the family of God.

89
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:17,299
We often refer to one another as fellow church members, as brother or sister, and we understand

90
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:21,820
that we are brethren, and it is to be expected that we would love one another.

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
And how do we do that?

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,899
We don't do that in our own power.

93
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,019
We do that through the power of the Holy Spirit of God, because of the love of God, because

94
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:34,019
of the fact that we have been loved, and He has shed His love in our lives.

95
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,220
We then, through the Holy Spirit of God, are able to love one another.

96
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,820
I'm not sure about you, but if you think back to your days prior to being saved, when you

97
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,660
were not converted, you probably did not have any desire to go to a church house, and you

98
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,700
probably had no love for the people of God.

99
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,420
But after we're saved, it's amazing how the Holy Spirit of God works in our hearts and

100
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,059
our lives, and how He gives us a love for the brethren.

101
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,140
We come from a variety of backgrounds.

102
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,660
We have different experiences and different upbringings, but one thing we have in common

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,700
is that bond that cannot be separated, and that is that Jesus Christ is our Savior.

104
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,380
And what a joy that is.

105
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,859
I've been to churches all over the place, and what a joy it is to be able to go to a

106
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:25,980
new location, to go to a new area, and to find a body of believers.

107
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,059
Brothers and sisters in Christ, people that I never have met before, but we can have love

108
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,059
one for another.

109
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:37,140
I remember when I was in Mexico, and dealing with some of those folks there in the church

110
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,700
where we were seeking to minister, and though I was in, I just had no ability to really

111
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,100
communicate with those people that we were seeking to worship with, they were translating

112
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:54,660
the service for us, because our Spanish was un poquito, and we just could not communicate.

113
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:03,660
But yet, there were some brethren that just wanted to just get close and have some fellowship,

114
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,380
in as much of a way as possible, with as few English words as they knew, and as few Spanish

115
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,019
words as I knew.

116
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,019
Try to have it, why?

117
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:19,179
Because we have this bond in Christ, we're brothers, we're sisters in Christ, and what

118
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,179
a joy.

119
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:24,640
And I believe that as we think about the truth of the Word of God, the teaching of the New

120
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,720
Testament, we understand that it is to be expected that as the people of God, we're

121
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,960
to love one another, we're to have love one toward another.

122
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,039
Jesus said this in John 13, if you turn back there, hold your spot here in 1 John, of course

123
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,039
John is the man that God would use to pen the Gospel of John, and the first, second,

124
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,159
third book of John, and the book of Revelation.

125
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,840
And we find that the apostle John is there throughout the Gospel of John, you will find

126
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,640
that he will refer to himself never as John, but as the one whom Christ loved, the one

127
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
whom Jesus loved.

128
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,440
And you think about the understanding that John had of the love that God had for him

129
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,479
personally, but John was there and he heard the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, and

130
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:16,280
he heard these words at the end of John 13, in verse number 34, Jesus said, a new commandment

131
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,039
I give unto you, that you love one another.

132
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,719
And then he says this, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

133
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:34,599
By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.

134
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:40,719
It's interesting because John 13 begins by telling us about the Lord Jesus Christ and

135
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:41,719
His love.

136
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:46,559
Notice in verse number 1 of John 13, now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew

137
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,479
that His hour was come, that He should depart out of this world unto the Father, having

138
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:58,119
loved His own which were in the world, notice this phrase, He loved them unto the end.

139
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,840
It's impactful.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,960
And then John heard Jesus say that you love one another as I have loved you, that you

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,480
also love one another.

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,120
I believe that it's expected that we should have love one for another as we have trusted

143
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,280
Christ as our Savior as we're born again and adopted in the family of God.

144
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,280
It is to be expected that we have love for the brethren.

145
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Notice not only back in 1 John chapter number 3 do we see to be expected as a love of the

146
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,120
brethren, I would say this as well, to be expected is hatred from the world.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
Listen, we should marvel not, that's what it says in verse number 13, marvel not my

148
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
brethren if the world hates you.

149
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,340
We'll get to that in just a moment, but notice the example that is used in verse number 12.

150
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,920
He says this, that we're to love one another, he says, not as Cain who was of that wicked

151
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,120
one and slew his brother, and wherefore slew he him?

152
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,400
Because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous.

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,680
Isn't it interesting to you that in 1 John chapter number 3 we have a reference all the

154
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
way back to Genesis chapter number 4?

155
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,000
And really by the Holy Spirit of God prompting John to use this example of Cain and Abel

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,120
from the book of Genesis in the fourth chapter, we find that this gives confirmation of the

157
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
record that we have in Genesis.

158
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,640
And I'm so thankful, listen, you understand this morning that Genesis 1 through 11 is

159
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,600
under increased attack in our society today.

160
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
The world, the enemy is trying to undermine the authority of the Word of God, they're

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,040
attacking creation, they're attacking the flood, they're attacking those first 11 chapters

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,620
of the book of Genesis.

163
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,520
Why does that portion of Scripture find itself under such attack?

164
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,680
Well if you can destroy the foundation, you have nothing else to set on.

165
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,920
We find that they seek to destroy the foundation so that they can then question all sorts of

166
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,560
other portions of Scripture.

167
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,560
In fact, basically the end of their logic goes something like this, if God is not the

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,160
Creator, and the Word of God says that He is, but if God is not the Creator, then why

169
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,640
is it that we would even need a Savior?

170
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
And that's where that line of thinking leads to.

171
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,200
And it is a terrible deception from the evil one, but we find here in 1 John that there's

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,720
reference to Cain and Abel.

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,880
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture, and we find that the Bible says that, not

174
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,240
as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.

175
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,800
It's the first murder that is mentioned in all of the Word of God.

176
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,300
We find that it was a rock that was used to kill his brother.

177
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,200
We find that he sought to cover the blood.

178
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,000
We find that God came and said, where art thou, brother?

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,720
And he said, am I my brother's keeper?

180
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,400
But we notice from that very event in Genesis chapter number 4 that you can continue to

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,160
read throughout the Word of God, throughout the pages of history, in the newspaper reports

182
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,280
today of murder.

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,460
Of murder.

184
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,160
It's a tragic thing.

185
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,680
But can I tell you, you're never going to, as you think about this subject of murder,

186
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,480
and you see the reference here of this hatred, and you see what's happening with Cain and

187
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,440
Abel and the means by which it was used, you have to understand that the Bible says

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,640
who was of that wicked one and slew his brother.

189
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Why?

190
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,000
Because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous.

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,520
Listen, you're not going to legislate righteousness.

192
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,480
You're just not going to do it.

193
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,840
You can outlaw anything you think that is a weapon that's going to bring some kind of

194
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,360
tragic end to another person's life, and somebody's going to find something to use to perform

195
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,160
that evil deed.

196
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Why?

197
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Because it's a matter of the heart.

198
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
It's a matter of the heart.

199
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
And that's why we say that Jesus is the answer.

200
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,320
That's why we say, listen, we are living in a generation.

201
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,160
We look around and we say, what is going on in our society?

202
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,400
What's going on in our world?

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,320
All of the evil that's taking place.

204
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Day after day, you're reading of evil wickedness.

205
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,920
We have outlawed God in our communities.

206
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,760
We've told our young people that God does not exist.

207
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,280
We've told them that they came from nothing and really they're going to nothing.

208
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,740
We have undermined the word of God.

209
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,440
We have decreased the value of life.

210
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,120
And then we sit around and say, wonder why this is happening?

211
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,640
Really?

212
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,320
We need a return to God.

213
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,760
We need a revival.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,000
We need an awareness of God.

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,800
There was a day in our history in the nation of the United States of America that you could

216
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,600
walk into the public places of our society, into the arenas of our public institutions,

217
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,240
of public schools, and see the Ten Commandments.

218
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,000
The Ten Commandments never saved anyone.

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,900
But I'm going to tell you what, when you read those Ten Commandments and you understood

220
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,880
something about God, it caused you to think a little bit about what your actions were

221
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,480
going to be, right?

222
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,280
And you think about the moral compass of our society.

223
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,320
We've gone off the deep end.

224
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,640
But look at what God says in 1 John chapter number 3 with regard to this evil, wicked

225
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,360
behavior of Cain.

226
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,320
It's because he was of that wicked one.

227
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,680
He was of that wicked one.

228
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,600
See, his works were evil, according to the end of verse number 12, and his brothers were

229
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
righteous.

230
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,800
It's interesting to me, do you understand that Cain was not an atheist?

231
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,760
He wasn't an atheist.

232
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,560
He tried to bring an offering to God, right?

233
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,800
You go back to Genesis 4.

234
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
He didn't deny God.

235
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,640
He came with the works of his own hands.

236
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,340
And God said, that's not acceptable, right?

237
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,560
He says to Cain, after Cain was wroth, he was angry, he says, God says to Cain, hey,

238
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
why are you angry?

239
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Why are you wroth?

240
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,440
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?

241
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,240
You've got to come the right way.

242
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,480
What was the offering of Abel?

243
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,000
It was an offering of blood.

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That was the right way.

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,880
That was the prescribed way.

246
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,400
Obviously, though we do not have all of the details in the Genesis record, God obviously

247
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,520
communicated effectively and completely to Adam what the right way was.

248
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,040
We see it in Genesis chapter number 3, after the fall, after sin entered into the world,

249
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
what did Adam and Eve do?

250
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,480
They tried to cover themselves with their own aprons, fig leaves.

251
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,680
God said, no, no, no, that's not going to be acceptable.

252
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:50,720
An animal had to be sacrificed so that skins could be provided, the leather would be provided

253
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,120
of a covering, and obviously the significance in the blood.

254
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,080
But notice, as he uses the example in verse number 12, and we see about the evil and the

255
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,840
hatred, notice what he says then in verse number 13, marvel not, that word marvel means

256
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
to wonder.

257
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,720
He says, marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you.

258
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,760
You know, it's to be expected that the world would hate us.

259
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm not suggesting that it's a delight.

260
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,500
I'm not suggesting that it should be something that we glory in, that the world hates us.

261
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,180
Most of us like to be liked.

262
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,680
But notice what Jesus said.

263
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,120
John, again, obviously would have heard these words, and he was used to pen them in John

264
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,480
chapter number 15 and verses 18 and 19.

265
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,920
Notice what the Lord Jesus Christ says.

266
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:47,040
These references in John 13 and John 15, these are just very soon before Jesus would go to

267
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,720
the cross of Calvary as he's sharing these truths with his disciples.

268
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,220
He says this in John 15 and verse 18, if the world hates you, you know that it hated me

269
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,820
before it hated you.

270
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,000
Notice what it says, if you were of the world, the world would love his own, but because

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,280
you're not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world

272
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
hateth you.

273
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Marvel not.

274
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
You say, pastor, this isn't very encouraging.

275
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
I understand, but it's true.

276
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,580
It's true.

277
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,940
You know why the world isn't going to love you?

278
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,560
Because they don't love your God.

279
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,460
That's really what it boils down to.

280
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,460
When you begin to think about the truth, listen, the gospel of Jesus Christ is confrontational.

281
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,020
The gospel of Jesus Christ confronts people with their need for the Savior.

282
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,700
And we find that here, what's to be expected, well, first, and the real primary aspect of

283
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,540
the text of Scripture is that there'd be love for the brethren, but understand this

284
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:51,140
morning that we should understand it to be expected that there will be hatred from the

285
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
world.

286
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:00,040
Listen, if the world loves us, there's probably something wrong, honestly.

287
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,260
If the world loves us, there's probably something wrong.

288
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,020
I've often said this with regard to the truth of separation.

289
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,100
The Bible says, come out from among them and be separate, saith the Lord.

290
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,860
You know what I found practically, is if we live holy lives and we live lives that we're

291
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,620
seeking to be pleasing to God, the lost, they're going to separate from us.

292
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,740
They don't like to be in the light.

293
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,120
They don't want to be in that presence, right?

294
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,220
And so, this morning, as we look at this, we know what's to be expected, but notice

295
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,300
number two, as we continue to move through the text of Scripture, verses 14 and 15, brotherly

296
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
love is an evidence.

297
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,460
It is an evidence of what?

298
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,300
Well, we said this in chapter number two, that it was an evidence that we were abiding

299
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,860
in Christ, that we were walking in the light.

300
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,660
This again is one of those birthmarks, if you will.

301
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,300
We've mentioned, as we've studied through the book of 1 John, that God gives us in this

302
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,940
book some birthmarks, some evidences of conversion.

303
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
That we can know.

304
00:19:59,940 --> 00:19:59,940


305
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,780
that we've been born again, that we can look at this

306
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,500
and we can see the work that Christ has done in us.

307
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,520
Again, as we referenced in 1 John chapter number two,

308
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,820
we spoke about the fact how that, in verse number five,

309
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,380
but whoso keepeth his word in him verily

310
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,880
is the love of God perfected, and God is doing a work in us.

311
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,500
We spoke last week about the work of sanctification.

312
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,540
There was a word on sin, there was a word about our Savior,

313
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,580
and then there was a word about our sanctification

314
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,140
and how we're to be daily seeking to be like our Savior,

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,100
and we find here in the text of Scripture

316
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,820
that in verses 14 and 15, John is going to provide us

317
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,140
with this truth of knowing, having this evidence.

318
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,380
Notice what he says in verse number 14, we know.

319
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,300
Now I love, again, as we've mentioned many times

320
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,740
in the book of 1 John and really the whole of Scripture,

321
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,420
you read about God giving us these knowledge nuggets.

322
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,780
We know, he wants us to know.

323
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,620
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro

324
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,740
with every wind of doctrine.

325
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,300
He doesn't want us to be wondering day by day,

326
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,000
am I his child, am I not his child?

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
Can you imagine if every day your children had to wake up

328
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,139
wondering if they were your kids?

329
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Can you imagine when you were growing up,

330
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,340
if every day growing up you had to wonder,

331
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,920
am I really their child?

332
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,500
It'd be a tough way to live.

333
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
How do I approach them?

334
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
But see, God wants us to know.

335
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,860
He wants us to have that security of our relationship

336
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,779
to him through the blood of Jesus Christ

337
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,060
and that we are his children.

338
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,920
Notice what he says, we know, to be confident of,

339
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,260
to have the assurance of, we know, what do we know?

340
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,260
That we have passed from death unto life.

341
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,459
What a great statement.

342
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:53,459
The truth of conversion, that we pass from death unto life,

343
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,740
that we were born again.

344
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Ephesians, Paul mentions it this way

345
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,779
in the book of Ephesians.

346
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,900
He says, you hath he quickened who were dead

347
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,340
in trespasses and sins.

348
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,000
We were dead, but we've been made alive.

349
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,339
We've passed from death unto life.

350
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,740
And he says, we know that we've passed unto death,

351
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,500
that we've passed, in verse number 14,

352
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
from death unto life, why?

353
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,199
Because we love the brethren.

354
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,820
That's pretty straightforward, is it not?

355
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,260
We know, we have this confidence, this assurance.

356
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,100
We know what?

357
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,540
We know that we've passed from death unto life,

358
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,979
the conversion, what is the evidence

359
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:42,380
that we love the brethren?

360
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,139
Notice he takes it a step further

361
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,460
at the end of verse number 14.

362
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,059
He makes it abundantly clear.

363
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:52,059
He says, he that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

364
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,220
Wow, I just don't like that person.

365
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,900
You better check things out.

366
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,059
Amen?

367
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,940
Listen, the reality this morning

368
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,460
is that as we look at this passage of scripture,

369
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,760
we're acknowledging that God is giving us

370
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,660
this evidence of our conversion.

371
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,740
He says, listen, when you're born again,

372
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,919
the Holy Spirit of God lives within you.

373
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,320
It's amazing what happens at salvation.

374
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,500
In fact, when you got saved, when I got saved,

375
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,699
we probably really didn't understand everything

376
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,260
that happened in that moment of salvation.

377
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,300
There were certain things that we had to understand.

378
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,279
We had to understand that we were sinners,

379
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,320
and we had to understand that because of our sin,

380
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,580
there was a penalty, and that penalty is death.

381
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,699
We had to understand that we could never

382
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,619
earn our own salvation.

383
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,740
There was nothing we could do.

384
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,520
There were no works that we could do.

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,220
There was nothing that we could do to earn our own salvation

386
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,260
but Jesus Christ died for us.

387
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,820
He paid the price.

388
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,380
He paid it in full.

389
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,580
We, at that moment, understood that we were sinners

390
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,460
on our way to a Christless eternity,

391
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,860
and he is the Savior, and he loves me,

392
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,660
and he said that whosoever shall call upon

393
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,279
the name of the Lord shall be saved,

394
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,619
and we called out and said, Lord, save me.

395
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,559
Now, I didn't understand everything that happened

396
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,020
in that moment on August 31st, 1997 in my life.

397
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,740
I didn't understand that the imputed righteousness

398
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,580
of Christ, I didn't understand that.

399
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,660
I didn't understand the fact that I was immediately

400
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,880
at that moment that the Holy Spirit of God indwelled me.

401
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,080
I couldn't talk to you about the difference

402
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,860
between the indwelling of the Spirit

403
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,239
and the filling of the Spirit.

404
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,720
I didn't understand a lot of that stuff,

405
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,119
and neither did most of you.

406
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,480
But after we got saved, we began to grow,

407
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,799
began to learn, and I learned that that day

408
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,880
that I got saved that the Holy Spirit of God came into me.

409
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,500
The Bible says that if we're saved this morning,

410
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,440
remember Paul says, know ye not that your body

411
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,660
is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,

412
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,140
which you have of God?

413
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,059
You're not your own, you're bought with a price.

414
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,059
Say, man, the Holy Spirit of God indwells me.

415
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,820
He's the earnest of our salvation.

416
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,940
We're sealed unto the day of redemption.

417
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,100
I didn't understand all of that,

418
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,059
but now as we look back and we see

419
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,940
and we understand salvation, the Holy Spirit of God

420
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,100
that indwells me is the same Holy Spirit of God

421
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,459
that indwells you if you've been saved,

422
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,940
and it's the Holy Spirit of God that allows me

423
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,899
to love as Christ loved.

424
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,660
It's the Holy Spirit of God that gives us

425
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,179
a love for the brethren.

426
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,739
I didn't have the Holy Spirit before I got saved.

427
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:31,299
I was dead, and he says here that this is an evidence

428
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,860
of your conversion.

429
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,580
We know, we're confident, we're assured of our conversion

430
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,799
that we've passed from death unto life.

431
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,640
Why?

432
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,980
Because we love the brethren.

433
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,820
I want you to understand here that John is not suggesting

434
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,739
that we love the brethren in order to pass

435
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,500
from death unto life.

436
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,980
Understand that.

437
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,860
Just like in 1 John chapter number two,

438
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,739
he's not suggesting that we keep his commandments

439
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,739
in order to know him.

440
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:05,220
He says in 1 John chapter number two and verse number three,

441
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,779
hereby we do know that we know him

442
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,299
if we keep his commandments.

443
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,140
He's not saying keep his commandments

444
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,739
and then you're gonna know that you're saved.

445
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,420
No, no, he's saying because you're saved,

446
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,220
because you've been born again,

447
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,380
you're gonna have this desire to keep his commandments.

448
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,820
And here in 1 John chapter number three,

449
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,940
he's not suggesting that we go around

450
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,160
and just try to love people.

451
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,339
I'm gonna love the brethren,

452
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,140
and that's going to be the way that I get saved.

453
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,339
No, what he's saying in this text of scripture

454
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,040
is that those that have passed from death unto life

455
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,519
will love the brethren.

456
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,880
That's an evidence of salvation.

457
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,519
It's amazing to me that Jesus said this.

458
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,799
We looked at it in John chapter number 13

459
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,140
as we looked at that text just a moment ago,

460
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,399
but remember in verse number 35,

461
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,760
Jesus said, by this shall all men know

462
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,080
that you're my disciples, what?

463
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,480
For your love one for another.

464
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,320
Now notice the difference between what Jesus said.

465
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,640
It's not something different that's a contradiction,

466
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,140
but notice the emphasis that Jesus places.

467
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,160
Jesus says, hey, listen, those people out there,

468
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,519
they're gonna know that we're his disciples

469
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,980
because we love each other.

470
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,160
That's impactful.

471
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,160
By this shall all men know that you're my disciples,

472
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,640
your love one for another.

473
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,239
But then John says, we know.

474
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,360
We know that we've passed from death unto life

475
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,640
if we love the brethren.

476
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,279
It's a self-administered test.

477
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,760
It's something that we look at in our lives

478
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,360
and we see, oh, thank God that he's given us

479
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,360
some evidences of salvation, some birthmarks of a believer.

480
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,040
And again, I can't explain it to you,

481
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,880
and you probably can't fully explain it to me,

482
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,260
but something happened after you got saved.

483
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Listen, I never wanted to read this book

484
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,160
before I got saved.

485
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,279
I never went to church before I got saved.

486
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,339
Honestly, we didn't even go to church on Easter, man.

487
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,779
Honestly, we just didn't.

488
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,839
My parents are here, they can tell you.

489
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,239
I remember my dad coming home and saying,

490
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,239
we're going to church on Sunday.

491
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,679
We're doing what?

492
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,660
That was my response.

493
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,799
I was 12 years old.

494
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,640
We had other things we did on Sunday.

495
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,920
But then I got saved.

496
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,159
From the time I got saved until right now,

497
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,599
this moment, I can't think of one time,

498
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,159
I can't think of one time that I stayed home from church

499
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,559
just because I didn't want to go.

500
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,400
Honestly.

501
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm not trying to pat myself on the back.

502
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,479
I'm just telling you that God gave me a love.

503
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,780
He did something.

504
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,080
I never wanted to go to church.

505
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,859
But then I got saved.

506
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm going to do everything I can to get in the house of God

507
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,679
to hear the word of God,

508
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,200
to fellowship with the people of God.

509
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,559
I didn't love the brethren.

510
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,059
I didn't have any desire to,

511
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,559
but now I love the brethren.

512
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,720
Isn't it amazing?

513
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,119
I'll speak from my personal perspective.

514
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,520
Some of you have the same testimony.

515
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,720
I have a lot of relatives that aren't saved.

516
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,119
I have more in common with you

517
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,679
than I do with those lost relatives.

518
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,599
I have real fellowship with you

519
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,559
that I can't have with those lost relatives.

520
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,599
It doesn't mean that I don't love them.

521
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,799
It doesn't mean that I don't want to see them saved,

522
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,539
but it's just different.

523
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
He teaches about brotherly love.

524
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,580
It's an evidence.

525
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,440
It's an evidence.

526
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,780
We know that we have passed from death into life

527
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,080
if we love the brethren.

528
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
And what a blessing, or I shouldn't say if, because we love the brethren.

529
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Let me quote it properly, because we love the brethren.

530
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,120
He says, he that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

531
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,100
Let me finish quickly this morning, number three.

532
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,640
We see brotherly love as an evidence, but notice how brotherly love is explained.

533
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,280
We're first reminded of the greatest example of love in verse number 16.

534
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,240
Most of us can quote John 3.16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten

535
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,880
son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

536
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,400
First John 3.16 is a verse that I would encourage you to memorize.

537
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,680
John 3.16, first John 3.16.

538
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,760
Notice what the word of God says.

539
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Hereby perceive.

540
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
You know what the word perceive means?

541
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
To know, to understand.

542
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:05,800
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought

543
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,440
to lay down our lives for the brethren.

544
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,920
First we're reminded of the love of God.

545
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm so thankful that God has declared his love to us in his word.

546
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,720
I'm thankful that God said that he loved the world.

547
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,640
I'm thankful for that declaration, but oh, how greatly we rejoice in the demonstration

548
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,040
of God's love, that he didn't simply declare it, but he demonstrated it.

549
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,120
We understand this in our lives.

550
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,280
We understand, listen, you can tell somebody you love them, but at some point your actions

551
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,280
are going to have to support your speech, right?

552
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,360
And we look here, and we look at the demonstration.

553
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
He says, hereby perceive.

554
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,800
This is how we know the love of God.

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Why?

556
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Because he laid down his life for us.

557
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,120
You remember the truth of Romans 5 and verse number 8?

558
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,120
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, while we were

559
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,480
yet sinners, Christ died for us.

560
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
That's how God commendeth his love toward us.

561
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,400
And here we find that as we look at this verse of Scripture, and we're dealing with this

562
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,560
subject of brotherly love, and we're reminded of what John heard in John 13 and verse 34

563
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,160
and 35, as it's recorded for us, that Jesus says, listen, I give you a new commandment,

564
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,760
that you love one another as I have loved you, Jesus says.

565
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,400
And now we find that John, as he's dealing with, and he's getting ready to explain the

566
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,760
brotherly love, the example that the Holy Spirit goes to is the truth of the love of

567
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,440
God, the greatest example of love.

568
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,320
The Greek word would be agape love, that self-sacrificing love, a love that is God's

569
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,000
love.

570
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,840
And I'm so thankful to be a recipient of God's love.

571
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,440
I'm so thankful that, as Paul said, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

572
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,360
in the book of Romans, there's nothing that can separate me from the love of God.

573
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,520
Aren't you thankful for that this morning?

574
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,160
We're to keep ourselves in the love of God, according to the book of Jude, and we find

575
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,160
here that he says, hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life

576
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
for us.

577
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,320
Now he's going to begin the explanation of love, this brotherly love that he's dealing

578
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
with.

579
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,240
He begins at the end of verse 16 and goes through verse 17 and 18.

580
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,920
Notice what he says, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren, but whoso hath

581
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:37,680
this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion

582
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:45,280
from him, notice the question, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

583
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,160
That's a question to really ponder, to meditate upon.

584
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:57,840
He says, whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth

585
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,320
up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

586
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,480
Notice the explanation in verse number 18, my little children.

587
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,160
Notice where he says love is not.

588
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,820
He says, let us not love in word, neither in tongue.

589
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,680
I would simply say that's our talk.

590
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:29,080
I don't think that it's suggesting that it's wrong to say I love you to someone, but what

591
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,320
he's getting at is what really is love.

592
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:43,520
Notice he says at the end of the verse, but, here's what love is, in deed and in truth.

593
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,320
Action, action.

594
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,920
And we think about the example that was used in verse number 16, the love of God.

595
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,680
He declared it, but then Jesus Christ went to that cruel cross.

596
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,800
What took our Savior to the cross?

597
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,540
The Romans?

598
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,240
The religious leaders that cried out, crucify him?

599
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:16,040
Ultimately, it was love because he said, I lay down my life in John chapter number 10.

600
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,000
He's the good shepherd and he lays down his life.

601
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,220
In fact, as we look at the text of Scripture, when you look at the crucifixion of our Savior,

602
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,500
we understood that it was love that took Him to the cross and it was love that kept

603
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,460
Him on the cross.

604
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,580
What an action.

605
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,160
What joy to know the love of God.

606
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:45,500
But then as the people of God, John says, here's how we're to love one another, not

607
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,580
just in talk, but in action.

608
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
Notice what James says.

609
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,620
Let's look at the book of James, if you will, in chapter number 2.

610
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,940
James chapter number 2, and I want you to look at verses 15 and 17.

611
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:04,300
He deals with the same scenario, really, that we see here in 1 John chapter 3 and verse

612
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,220
number 17, but notice here in James 2 and verses 15 and 17, 15 through 17, notice what

613
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:17,520
he says, if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say

614
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,960
unto them, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not

615
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,880
those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?

616
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,080
What a great question.

617
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,440
You see a brother or sister that's naked and destitute of daily food, and you say to them,

618
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,960
depart in peace, be warmed and filled, but you don't give them anything.

619
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,120
There's no action.

620
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,560
You have this world's good, is what he says in 1 John 3 and verse number 17, but whoso

621
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,840
hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion

622
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,680
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

623
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,080
We're not to love, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.

624
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,280
Notice what the book of Romans says, turn to the book of Romans, if you will, and we'll

625
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,080
close with this thought in Romans chapter number 12.

626
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,040
In Romans chapter number 12, see, the world kind of has this philosophy, and I'll use

627
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,520
the expression, I remember hearing it often as I worked in the corporate world, and I

628
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,280
don't know where the expression originated from, but, you know, it's kind of that idea

629
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,000
of, if you do this for me, I'll do something for you.

630
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,160
You know, you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back, kind of an idea.

631
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,480
And really, I've done favors for you, you do favors for me, and that's kind of how things

632
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,480
sometimes work, the motivation for certain things.

633
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,520
But notice here, in Romans chapter number 12, we deal with the love that we're to have,

634
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,720
this brotherly love that is described for us in the Word of God.

635
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:59,480
The Bible says this in Romans 12, in verse number 9, let love be without dissimulation.

636
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,920
Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.

637
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,880
Now, that word dissimulation is not a word that we use in our vocabulary every single

638
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,120
day, but really, just plainly, it means to have love that's without hypocrisy.

639
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,680
Let me say it this way, sincere.

640
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,500
Let love be without dissimulation.

641
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,680
It's a love that is to be sincere.

642
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,100
It's a love that's unfeigned.

643
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,300
It's a love that's without hypocrisy.

644
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,200
It's a love that expects nothing in return.

645
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,480
That's how we're to love.

646
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,440
I believe this morning that as we look at this passage of Scripture in 1 John chapter

647
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,440
number 3, verses 11 through 18, obviously, we know the wisdom of God.

648
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,720
We see all throughout the New Testament how often this subject of brotherly love comes

649
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
up.

650
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
It's recurring.

651
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,799
You can't deny it.

652
00:38:54,799 --> 00:39:00,160
In the little epistle, this little letter, 1 John, five chapters, on at least three separate

653
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,160
occasions, he deals with the subject of brotherly love.

654
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,280
You read Jesus teaching about it.

655
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,480
You read John here.

656
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,119
We read of Paul teaching about it.

657
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,980
You read of Peter discussing it.

658
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,340
You read of Paul speaking to the church in Thessalonica about how they need to love one

659
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:22,299
another more and more that we increase in our love one for another.

660
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:23,299
We're taught of God.

661
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:24,799
We see the example of it.

662
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,760
Why is it recurring so often?

663
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,960
We need to be reminded of it, of our love one for another.

664
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Why?

665
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,080
Because this is not something that's natural.

666
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,040
This is something that is supernatural.

667
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,679
This is something that is reserved to the individual that has been born again, that's

668
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,640
been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ.

669
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,679
This morning, as we look at this text of Scripture, and we're reminded of this statement that

670
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,920
we're to love in deed and in truth.

671
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,200
Not only do I know through the evidence that's mentioned in this

672
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,880
text of Scripture that I've passed from death unto life because I love the brethren, but

673
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,040
we also understand here in the text of Scripture when we couple it with John 13 that those

674
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,500
without will know that we're His disciples because of our love one for another.

675
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,680
Let me say this as I wrap it up.

676
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,200
It's easy for us to say we love the brethren, but I want you to notice how the Holy Spirit

677
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,580
of God takes it very specific in our text of Scripture in 1 John chapter 3 because sometimes

678
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,080
we can say we love the brethren and it be that plurality, right?

679
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
We love the brethren.

680
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,320
We love the people of God.

681
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,080
But notice how He brings it down to the individual in verse number 17, and seeth his brother

682
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,440
have need, and seeth his brother have need.

683
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,000
It's the individual.

684
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,880
We think about the love of God.

685
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,600
Listen, I'm so thankful that God loved me.

686
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Aren't you thankful that God loved you?

687
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,200
When the Holy Spirit of God indwelled me and when He indwelled you, He gives us a love

688
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
for the brethren.

689
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,280
It's an evidence of salvation.

690
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,680
Oh, that we would increase more and more in this area of love.

691
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,320
I believe that God's given us a church where there's a genuine love one for another.

692
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
I believe it's evidence.

693
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,040
I've had people that have visited our church that have said this to me more than one time.

694
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,640
They've said this to me.

695
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,120
One thing that's really unique about your church is it seems like the people actually

696
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,640
care about each other.

697
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

698
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,080
Because we love one another.

699
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,320
But let me say this, even as Paul said to the church in Thessalonica, we are to increase

700
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,040
more and more.

701
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Love for the brethren.

702
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,280
Our love is to be in deed and in truth.

703
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,680
More than just talking, it's an action.

704
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Let's pray.

705
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,840
Father, we love You.

706
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,920
How we thank You for loving us.

707
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,760
We thank You for the truth of Your precious Word.

708
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,160
We thank You for the subject matter that is before us this morning.

709
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,440
God, we thank You for the birthmarks, the evidences that You give us in Your Word with

710
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,080
regard to conversion.

711
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:26,360
God, as we think about this recurring subject, I pray that You'd help us to walk in the light.

712
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,200
Lord, help us to live lives that are pleasing in Thy sight.

713
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,400
God, help us to impact this world.

714
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,680
Help us not to marvel that the world hates us.

715
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,240
You've already told us that's to be expected.

716
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,080
Help us to love in deed and in truth.

717
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,240
Not just through our speech, but through our actions.

718
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,000
God, if there's one that's present that's not been saved, they don't know the Lord Jesus

719
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,640
Christ is their personal Savior.

720
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,320
They've never been born again.

721
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,280
If they were to die today, they have no idea what would happen.

722
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:16,680
Father, I pray that You would allow the Holy Spirit of God to convict that individual or

723
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,920
those individuals of their sin of Christ's righteousness of judgment to come, that they

724
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,240
would understand, they would perceive the love of God, that they'd understand that You

725
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,040
love them so much that You died for them.

726
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:37,520
You were buried and You rose again to pay for the sin of mankind.

727
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,400
Lord, if there's one that's lost, I pray that today they'd be saved, that we'd have an opportunity

728
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,760
to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

729
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,040
For every child of God, would You help us to be encouraged this morning through this

730
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,640
passage of Scripture?

731
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,840
Help us to evaluate our love for the brethren.

732
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,720
We pray that You'd move and work in this time of invitation as only You can.

733
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,560
I pray that each decision that is made would be sealed.

734
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,800
Lord, that we'd leave this place doers of the Word.

735
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,480
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

736
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,480
Would You stand with me?

737
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,559
At the end of our services, we have a moment of invitation for those visiting with us,

738
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,200
just so you understand what's taking place.

739
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,920
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

740
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,080
No one's forced to move or make any kind of decisions, but we do want to give you an opportunity

741
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,640
to respond.

742
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,040
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.

743
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,520
Perhaps you want to come to this old-fashioned altar and just ask the Lord to help you in

744
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
this area.

745
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,120
Maybe you want to ask the Lord to, or thank the Lord for His love for you.

746
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,640
Maybe you want to thank the Lord for the love for the brethren.

747
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Maybe you're not saved.

748
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,120
We'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

749
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,960
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
