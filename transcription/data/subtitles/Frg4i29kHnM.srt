1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Genesis, chapter number 18, we'll finish the chapter this evening, be looking at verse

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,399
16 down through verse number 33.

3
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:20,520
Genesis 18, verses 16 through 33, in verse number 16, the Bible says, and the men rose

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,719
up from the fence and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to bring them on

5
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,719
the way.

6
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,000
And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,880
Notice in verse 32, and he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,520
this once.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,819
Peradventure, ten shall be found there.

10
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:51,439
And he, the Lord, said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

11
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,659
I'm going to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, I Will Not Destroy

12
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,060
It for Ten's Sake.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,979
It was back in Genesis, chapter number 13, that we learned of the strife between the

14
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,980
herdmen of Abraham and the herdmen of Lot, and we understand that that strife led to

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,739
a discussion, and Abraham had given Lot the option as to where he would like to go and

16
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,160
what land it was that he would like to have.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,540
And we find that the result of that discussion was Lot chose all the plain of Jordan to be

18
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,440
his home.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,120
Soon thereafter, we found that the Bible recorded for us a battle that took place, and in that

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,319
battle, Lot and many were taken captive.

21
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,120
The Bible tells us that Lot now dwelt in the land of Sodom, and he had been taken captive

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,000
with his goods and his family and many others that were taken captive as a result of that

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
battle.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,720
And it was Abraham that rose up, he and the trained servants from his home, and they went

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,099
and they recovered all, the Bible says, and there was a great delivery, and we find that

26
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,819
it was there in that passage of Scripture that the Lord had the opportunity, or excuse

27
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:02,379
me, that Abraham had the opportunity to meet Melchizedek, and we understood of that great

28
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:07,940
meeting and the way in which the Lord revealed to Abraham that he is the most high God, El

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Elyon.

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,860
And we know that from that time, as we had been introduced to those particular subjects

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,720
and understood the traveling of these individuals, that many years have now passed, and as we

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,199
have looked at the last several chapters of the book of Genesis, we find that through

33
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,880
those years and the events that had taken place, we've not really heard anything of

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,080
Lot whatsoever, nor have we heard anything of Sodom and Gomorrah.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,600
But yet we find that the wickedness of these cities was known by God and judgment was coming.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,360
We're mindful of what the wise men would say in Proverbs chapter number 14, in verse

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:55,399
number 34, when he said, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

38
00:02:55,399 --> 00:03:00,960
We find here in this text of Scripture that God is going to reveal some things to Abraham,

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,839
and we find that Abraham is going to respond to that which is given to him.

40
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:10,919
If you are taking notes this evening, I simply have, I have two points this evening.

41
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,639
Number one in your notes, information is provided.

42
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,759
Notice with me in verses 16 through 22 that God provides Abraham with some information.

43
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,559
We could ask this question at the onset of the message this evening, why is it that God

44
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,639
would tell Abraham what he would tell him?

45
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,080
Well, in verse number 16, we find that the Bible says that the men rose up from the fence,

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,960
they looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,320
And the Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do, seeing that Abraham

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,800
shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
blessed in him.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,600
You remember the promises that had been made to Abraham with regard to a seed and with

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,880
regard to a land, and we find that God is understanding and giving this information,

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:10,320
and really we find that these verses of Scripture are given to us in verses 16 through 19 so

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,040
that we could have an understanding as to why God is giving this information to Abraham.

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,679
We find that he notes about the mighty nation that would become, we find also that in verse

55
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,480
number 19, notice the first phrase, for I know him.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,119
And you read the book of Revelation in chapters 2 and 3, and you read those letters to the

57
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:36,119
seven churches of Asia, and you find that repeated throughout those portions of Scripture,

58
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,679
I know thy works.

59
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,200
God knows everything about us.

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,200
And here he says, for I know him, notice what he says, that he, Abraham, will command his

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,959
children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.

62
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,679
To do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath

63
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,239
spoken of him.

64
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:04,959
I believe that as you look at these verses of Scripture, it helps us to have a little

65
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,320
insight to further revelation that we'll have in the Word of God, where God refers to Abraham

66
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,940
as being the friend of God.

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:20,359
In fact, if you note over in James chapter number 2 and verse number 23, the Bible says

68
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:26,119
this, it says, and the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it

69
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:32,040
was imputed unto him for righteousness, that's a reference to Genesis 15, and he, Abraham,

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,519
was called the friend of God.

71
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,959
We find not only why God would tell Abraham this information, but what is it that God

72
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,720
told Abraham.

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,920
In verse number 20, we find that here becomes the focus of the information that is provided

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
to Abraham.

75
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:57,559
It says, the Lord said, the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah God is speaking, and He says, in verse

76
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:08,119
number 20, because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous.

77
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:12,859
We find that it says, I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according

78
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:18,799
to the cry of it which has come upon to me, and if not, I will know.

79
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:23,559
You'll remember that it was back in Genesis chapter number 13, that discussion that took

80
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:30,600
place between Abraham and Lot after the contention, the strife with the herdmen, and the Bible

81
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,760
tells us that when Lot chose all of the plain of Jordan, it says in verse number 12 of Genesis

82
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,720
13, that Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain,

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,959
and pitched his tent toward Sodom, but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before

84
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:51,119
the Lord exceedingly.

85
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,359
We understand here this evening that as we look at this information that is provided

86
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:00,579
to Abraham, that Abraham is made aware of the sinfulness of Sodom.

87
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:06,640
No doubt in my mind that Abraham had an awareness of what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah,

88
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,760
as we would see in his response to that which is given.

89
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,440
He understood what was going on in those cities, and we find that as God would reveal the sinfulness

90
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,959
of Sodom, that God also speaks to Abraham about the pending judgment.

91
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,119
How do we know that God is revealing to Abraham of this pending judgment?

92
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:32,679
Well, you'll note that the immediate response of Abraham, as it's recorded in verse number

93
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,200
23, is he says,

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,279
"'Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?'

95
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,119
Why would Abraham ask that question?

96
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,079
Because God had revealed that judgment was coming.

97
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,920
God had revealed that they were going to be punished for their sin.'"

98
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:55,399
I'm so thankful that we serve a God who is holy, and is gracious and merciful, and often

99
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,040
times as the people of God will speak of His long-suffering, but we understand this evening

100
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,040
that our God is just, and He is the righteous judge.

101
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,959
And we find this evening that He, as the righteous judge, He will mete out judgment.

102
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,679
And we find that the Word of God reveals to us throughout the pages of Scripture the

103
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:19,880
way in which mankind will face judgment.

104
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,239
And here in this portion of Scripture, we find that these individuals, the inhabitants

105
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:29,880
of these lands, the Sodom and Gomorrah and the accompanying cities, that God had been

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,400
long-suffering with them.

107
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,799
The Bible tells us in chapter number 13 that they were exceeding sinful.

108
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,599
They were wicked.

109
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,039
We understand that they had existed for a period of time before that reference in chapter

110
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,359
13, and we find that they were an exceeding sinful people, and a number of years have

111
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:56,400
passed between Genesis 13 and Genesis 18.

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,359
God's judgment, God's justice, was to be poured out upon the inhabitants because of their

113
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,359
wickedness.

114
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:09,359
See, there's coming a day in which mankind will face the judgment of God Almighty.

115
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:15,479
I've seen, I have witnessed firsthand individuals that have worn paraphernalia, maybe on a ball

116
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:20,760
cap or on a shirt that says, only God can judge me.

117
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,599
And when I've seen individuals wearing that paraphernalia, the last time I saw someone

118
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:30,760
wearing it was in a Walmart here not long ago, and as I witnessed that person wearing

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,559
that statement upon their clothing, I was broken in my heart understanding that, sir,

120
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,039
one day you will stand before God Almighty.

121
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,080
Judgment is real.

122
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,000
And here, God is sharing with Abraham about the judgment, the pending judgment upon the

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,359
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and those in that area.

124
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,840
We understand here in verse number 21 that He gives this truth, and verse 22, and the

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,000
men turned their faces from fence.

126
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
and went towards Sodom."

127
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Remember, as we studied the first section

128
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,639
of chapter number 18, there were three,

129
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,520
the two angels and the Lord Jehovah was there.

130
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,560
And it says here at the end of verse number 22,

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,279
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

132
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,959
So if you can get in your mind's eye what's taking place

133
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,520
and Abraham had ministered, they had had a meal,

134
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
as we mentioned the beginning of chapter number 18

135
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,120
last Sunday evening, and as they continued

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,399
and had that feast and they finished,

137
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,040
God repeated to Abraham the promise

138
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
of a son at this appointed time.

139
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,919
Sarah laughed in Abraham's question.

140
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,159
And now they're rising up to leave.

141
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,599
They have this conversation.

142
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:42,400
The two angels proceed to go towards Sodom.

143
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,319
And the Bible says in verse number 22,

144
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:48,880
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

145
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,759
We find that in the next verses of scripture

146
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,400
is really what we see as the response of Abraham

147
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,319
to that which had been given.

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,959
The information is provided.

149
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,439
I've made note this evening that God gave Abraham

150
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,319
this information.

151
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,559
He calls him the friend of God.

152
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,480
I want you to be mindful of the fact that in like manner,

153
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,040
just as Abraham was made aware of some information here

154
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,800
in Genesis chapter number 18,

155
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
we find that as the children of God,

156
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,760
we too have been given some information.

157
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,519
In John chapter number 15, I want to draw your attention

158
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,559
to what the Lord Jesus Christ says

159
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,599
to these disciples in John 15.

160
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:31,080
You understand the timeline perhaps of the book of John,

161
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,639
and it would just be a short period of time

162
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,519
before the Lord Jesus Christ would go

163
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
to the cross of Calvary.

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
He had been giving the truth.

165
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
In chapter number 13, he washed the feet of the disciples

166
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,959
and told them that he would soon depart.

167
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,760
He told them, let not your heart be troubled.

168
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,879
He's given them all of this information

169
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,400
in these few chapters, in chapters 13 through 16.

170
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,120
And we find here in verse number 14 of John 15,

171
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,959
notice what Jesus says to his disciples.

172
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,760
Ye are my friends.

173
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,440
If you do whatsoever I command you,

174
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,519
henceforth I call you not servants.

175
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,679
Notice this, for the servant knoweth not

176
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,360
what his Lord doeth, but I have called you friends.

177
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,559
For all things that I have heard of my father,

178
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,080
I have made known unto you.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
There were some things, some information

180
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,440
that was provided to the disciples

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,880
that others were not aware of.

182
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,119
We find that for us as the people of God,

183
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,520
the children of God, we understand

184
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,759
the Bible tells us that the Scriptures have been given

185
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,279
to us the Holy Spirit of God who indwells us

186
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,240
as the individual believer, that he is our teacher.

187
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,520
We understand that the Bible would tell us

188
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,279
of the unregenerate man that they cannot understand

189
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,600
the things of the Spirit of God.

190
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,240
They do not understand the Bible.

191
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,059
I've had people tell me before, I

192
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,940
just don't understand it, I don't get it.

193
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,020
Well, 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14

194
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,380
says, the natural man receiveth not the things

195
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,460
of the Spirit of God.

196
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,960
Why?

197
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,580
For they are foolishness unto him,

198
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,860
neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.

199
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,220
If you've been born again, you have the Holy Spirit of God

200
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,419
that indwells you, and the Holy Spirit is the teacher.

201
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,339
You say, well, I don't understand everything.

202
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,580
I understand, join the club, amen.

203
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,820
But the reality is that we dig in

204
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
and we continue seeking to grow and learn,

205
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,899
and we have the opportunity to ask the author

206
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,059
to pray for that truth would be given to us.

207
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,660
Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out

208
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,619
of thy law.

209
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,779
Teach me thy ways.

210
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,300
We find that God would answer that prayer,

211
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,419
and we have in our hands this evening

212
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,139
a precious book that contains much information that God

213
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,940
has given to us as his people.

214
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,339
This evening, information is provided to Abraham,

215
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,580
and we know how Abraham would respond

216
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
if you're taking notes.

217
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,740
Number two, intercession is recorded.

218
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,339
Information is provided, and intercession is recorded.

219
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,660
According to verse number 22, two of these men,

220
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,059
as I mentioned already, proceeded towards Sodom,

221
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,940
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

222
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,899
And I want you to notice what is said in verse number 23.

223
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,459
And Abraham drew near.

224
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,220
The first song that we sang this evening,

225
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,339
I did not pick the songs.

226
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,859
Draw me nearer.

227
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:27,700
Isn't that wonderful?

228
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,420
And how appropriate to be mindful of this reality

229
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,619
that Abraham drew near.

230
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:36,940
What a great privilege for us as the people of God

231
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,179
to draw near to the Lord.

232
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,500
The psalmist said in Psalm 78, excuse me,

233
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,480
Psalm 73 in verse number 28, notice

234
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,820
what the psalmist says here in this portion of scripture

235
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,859
with regard to drawing near unto the Lord.

236
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,420
The Bible says this, but it is good for me

237
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,220
to draw near to God.

238
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,899
I have put my trust in the Lord God

239
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,700
that I may declare all thy works.

240
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,299
Oh, it was good for me, it's good for the psalmist,

241
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:10,500
it's good for you and I to draw near unto the Lord.

242
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,179
We find that we'll visit Psalm 73

243
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,459
near the end of our message again,

244
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,059
so you might want to put a bookmark there.

245
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,820
We'll be back there in just a little while,

246
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,980
but I want to take note of a New Testament truth

247
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,100
as well in James chapter number 4

248
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,380
in verses 7 and 8 where the Bible says this,

249
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,859
submit yourselves therefore to God,

250
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,899
resist the devil and he will flee from you.

251
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,459
Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you.

252
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,980
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners,

253
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,380
and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

254
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,459
What a great privilege.

255
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,220
Do you see in your mind's eye this evening

256
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,500
how that these two angels continue on their way to Sodom

257
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,299
and the Lord stays and Abraham draws near to the Lord.

258
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,140
And we see the intercession that is recorded.

259
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,739
We find here that Abraham begins with the number 50

260
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,859
and he'll end in verse number 32 with the number 10.

261
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,420
What is it that he's praying?

262
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,619
Notice at the end of verse number 23,

263
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:09,619
will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

264
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,500
Peradventure, verse 24,

265
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,299
there be 50 righteous within the city.

266
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,260
Wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place

267
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,820
for the 50 righteous that are therein?

268
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,220
That be far from thee to do after this manner,

269
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,660
to slay the righteous with the wicked,

270
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,940
and that the righteous should be as the wicked,

271
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,220
that be far from thee.

272
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,980
Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?

273
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,540
You notice what Abraham's recognizing here.

274
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:41,220
He's recognizing that God is the judge of all the earth.

275
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,820
And in fact, God will do that which is right.

276
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,019
And we find that here, Abraham begins to plead,

277
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,980
to intercede on the behalf of the inhabitants

278
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,140
of Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities.

279
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,980
No doubt in my mind that Abraham is aware of the fact

280
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,899
that Lot and the family live there in Sodom.

281
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,739
And he begins to intercede.

282
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
We notice the response.

283
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,660
It's a response of intercession.

284
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,100
And the Lord said in verse 26,

285
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:19,660
if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city,

286
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,619
then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

287
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,459
And Abraham answered and said, verse 27,

288
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,739
behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord,

289
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:35,660
which in but dust and ashes,

290
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,179
peradventure there shall lack five of the 50 righteous.

291
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,339
Will thou destroy all the city for lack of five?

292
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:46,299
So he's now at 45 and he, the Lord said,

293
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,540
if I find there 40 and five, I will not destroy it.

294
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,179
And he's speaking to him yet again and said,

295
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,140
peradventure there shall be 40 found there.

296
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,779
He said, I will not do it for 40's sake.

297
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,140
And he said unto him, oh, let not the Lord be angry

298
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,980
and I will speak peradventure there shall 30 be found there.

299
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,459
And he said, I will not do it if I find 30 there.

300
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,779
And he said, behold now,

301
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,660
I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord,

302
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,179
peradventure there should be 20 found there.

303
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,619
And he said, I will not destroy it for 20's sake.

304
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,739
Verse 32, and he said, oh, let not the Lord be angry

305
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,059
and I will speak yet but this once.

306
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,580
Peradventure 10 shall be found there.

307
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,500
And he, the Lord said, I will not destroy it for 10's sake.

308
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,219
And the Lord went his way

309
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:45,340
as soon as he had left communing with Abraham

310
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,299
and Abraham returned unto his place.

311
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,780
The interaction, the discussion is now ended

312
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,900
according to verse 33, the Lord goes on

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,020
and we find that Abraham returns unto his place

314
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,260
and as we would know in verse number 33,

315
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
the end of this discussion,

316
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,900
the intercession that we're mentioning this evening

317
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,099
is it comes to a conclusion,

318
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,659
but we find that beginning in verse number 23

319
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,859
and going down through verse number 32

320
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,739
that Abraham is interceding,

321
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,979
we find that it's quite obvious

322
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:20,460
that his concern for people is on display.

323
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,539
The reality is that these people were wicked sinners.

324
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,739
The reality is that this has something

325
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,659
that Abraham had known for some period of time

326
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:34,099
where it says that the men of Sodom were wicked

327
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,380
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

328
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,020
We find that it was there in chapter number 18

329
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,299
that God says about their sin being great

330
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,460
and it's very grievous.

331
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,460
And yet, Abraham does not say,

332
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,099
give them what they deserve, Lord.

333
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,419
I mean, strike them dead.

334
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:52,820
No, no.

335
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,179
He's interceding for them.

336
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,619
He's interceding on their behalf.

337
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:00,020
He's responding to the information.

338
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,180
that he receives with intercession.

339
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,380
You see the heart of Abraham on display in this portion of Scripture.

340
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,780
His concern for individuals and for the destruction of the righteous with the wicked.

341
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,860
As I begin to think about Abraham and his response here in this portion of Scripture,

342
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,020
and I begin to think about the whole of Scripture and understanding the historical context in

343
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,320
the next couple of weeks, we'll begin looking at the next chapters and the events that unfold

344
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,180
and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and we'll begin to see all of those things

345
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:42,540
and many references in the New Testament with regard to this particular historical fact.

346
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,540
But just for a moment this evening, I want to take some time to try to make some application

347
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,480
with regard to the response of Abraham.

348
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,880
How he responds to the information that he receives.

349
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,640
In fact, this evening I believe that God has given us the opportunity to look at a number

350
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,960
of references throughout the Word of God of individual believers that had been given information

351
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,720
from God Almighty and how they responded to that information that was given.

352
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,920
We find here with Abraham that it was a response of intercession.

353
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,320
It was a response of Abraham pleading and saying,

354
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,920
would you destroy the righteous with the wicked?

355
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,640
And we find that the righteousness, remember we mentioned already in Proverbs chapter number

356
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,000
14 and verse number 34, righteousness exalteth a nation, sin is a reproach to any people.

357
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,320
You note that God said that if he found 50 within the city, according to verse number

358
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,200
26, then will I spare all the place for their sakes.

359
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Staying the hand of judgment, if you will.

360
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,360
I want you to think about Elisha, turn to the book of 2 Kings, if you will, in chapter

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,000
number 8.

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Eventually we're going to make it to the New Testament and look at the Apostle Paul.

363
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,880
I have a few examples from the Old Testament here.

364
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,480
What was it that Abraham was told was going to happen impending judgment upon these cities,

365
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,280
Sodom and Gomorrah, and this destruction because of their sin?

366
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
And he intercedes.

367
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,560
We find that it's here in 2 Kings chapter number 8.

368
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,760
Notice what is said, I'm going to read verse number 13 and then we're going to go back

369
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,160
and read the preceding verses, but in verse number 13 of 2 Kings chapter 8, the Bible

370
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,600
says, and Haziel said, but what is thy servant, he's speaking to Elisha, what is thy servant,

371
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,080
a dog, that he should do this great thing?

372
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,040
And Elisha answered, notice what he says, the Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be

373
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,240
king over Syria.

374
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,360
Not only that he would be king over Syria, but all of the destruction that he would bring

375
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,160
upon the people of God.

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,020
It's mentioned in verse number 12, and Haziel said, why weepeth my Lord?

377
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,860
And he, Elisha, answered, because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children

378
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,900
of Israel, their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay

379
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,940
with the sword, and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child.

380
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,620
And that's terrible.

381
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,340
Haziel says, why?

382
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,340
Why is it?

383
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,900
I mean, what am I, thy servant, a dog, and that I should do this thing?

384
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,460
And Elisha says, no, the Lord hath showed me.

385
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,360
The Lord had given me this information.

386
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,540
The Lord revealed to me what's going to happen.

387
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,340
And how is it that Elisha responded to that which he heard?

388
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,180
You notice in verse number 11, and he settled his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed,

389
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,180
and the man of God wept.

390
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,820
The man of God wept.

391
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,220
Elisha wept.

392
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,460
Why?

393
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,500
Because he knew what Haziel, the king of Syria, was going to do to the inhabitants

394
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,420
of Israel, to his countrymen.

395
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,580
And he's understanding that this information has been provided.

396
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,620
The Lord hath showed me.

397
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,300
The Lord hath revealed to me what you're going to do, and here's what you're going to do,

398
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,140
and it caused the man of God to weep.

399
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
He wept.

400
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,220
I want you to think about Jonah.

401
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
The book of Jonah.

402
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,220
The book of Jonah.

403
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,620
Many of us are familiar with the book of Jonah.

404
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:39,140
We understand that the Lord spoke to Jonah, and you find that God said to Jonah, arise

405
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,620
and go to Nineveh.

406
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,940
In verse number 2 of chapter number 1, that great city, and cry against it.

407
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Why?

408
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,540
Because wickedness has come up before me.

409
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,460
We know I don't have time this evening to go through the entirety of the book of Jonah,

410
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,620
but we understand that Jonah went in the exact opposite direction of where he was told to

411
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,460
go.

412
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Jonah fled.

413
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
He got on a ship.

414
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,940
He paid the fare.

415
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,940
He's trying to get away from that which God had instructed him to do.

416
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,980
You understand that God had given Jonah this assignment to go to Nineveh.

417
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,620
If you would understand the timing of the book of Jonah, and understanding all that

418
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,700
was taking place, the Assyrians were the world power, and we find that just shortly after

419
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:33,780
the prophecy and the time of Jonah's ministry that the Assyrians would take captive Israel.

420
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
They were a hated people.

421
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,540
I mean, just being honest.

422
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,500
There was great enmity between the Assyrians and basically anybody else, and Nineveh's

423
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
the capital.

424
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,460
It's a wicked city.

425
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,060
It's a great city.

426
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,100
Jonah goes his way.

427
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,940
You understand there's a great storm and a great fish that the Lord prepared, and in

428
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,740
chapter number 3 we find that the Lord spoke to Jonah again and gave him the same assignment.

429
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,620
We find that Jonah went and he came into the city, and the Bible says there in verse number

430
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
4 of chapter 3,

431
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,860
Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried and said,

432
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,140
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

433
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:27,180
The people responded with repentance, and the judgment was stayed.

434
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,880
I believe with all of my heart that if the people of Nineveh would not have repented

435
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,940
in forty days, they would have been destroyed, because that's what God said.

436
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,780
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed.

437
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Why is it that Jonah fled?

438
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,820
Well, when you read chapter number 4, you understand why it is that Jonah fled.

439
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,060
If I could summarize it this way, basically Jonah was happy that they were going to face

440
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,340
judgment.

441
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
Jonah knew.

442
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,540
Notice what it says in Jonah 4 and verse number 1.

443
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,740
It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

444
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,020
Why?

445
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,260
Can you understand what happens in Nineveh?

446
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
This is a revival.

447
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,340
They believe the message of God.

448
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,340
They repented in sackcloth and ashes, I mean, from the greatest to the least, and it's amazing

449
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,860
as you read chapter number 3, verses 5 through verse number 10.

450
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,300
The Bible tells us right after this great revival that the preacher Jonah is displeased

451
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,180
and very angry.

452
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,060
Notice verse number 2.

453
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:42,060
He Jonah prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying

454
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,580
when I was yet in my country?

455
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,500
Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish.

456
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Why?

457
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:55,220
For I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,

458
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,060
and repentest thee of the evil.

459
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,660
For now, O Lord, take I beseech thee my life for me, for it is better for me to die than

460
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,420
to live.

461
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,580
Jonah says, let them get what they deserve.

462
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,300
I mean, he didn't want to go and preach.

463
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,900
He didn't want to go and deliver the message.

464
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Why?

465
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,940
Because he knew that God was gracious and merciful, slow to anger.

466
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,300
By the way, all of those things are reasons that we as believers rejoice.

467
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Are they not?

468
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,620
Aren't you thankful this evening that God is gracious towards you?

469
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,059
And merciful towards you?

470
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,020
And slow to anger towards you?

471
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,460
I mean, I'm thankful this evening that our God is ready to pardon, as I mentioned on

472
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Wednesday evening.

473
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,020
We look at that portion of Scripture from Luke 11.

474
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,220
Oh, our God is ready to pardon, He's ready to forgive.

475
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,260
His mercy endureth forever.

476
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,220
These are reasons to rejoice.

477
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,540
And Jonah is saying, I like those things for me, but not for them.

478
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,140
I mean, isn't that what's saying?

479
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,100
By the way, this isn't a good response, right?

480
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,380
The response of Abraham, to intercede.

481
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:15,140
The response of Elisha, to the information that he had received, to weep.

482
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,700
The response of Jonah, I'm going the other way.

483
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,820
I don't want to take the message.

484
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,260
Now, he eventually goes and takes the message, but then he's angry about it.

485
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:29,059
Of course, we know that at the end of the chapter, there was the gourd and all that

486
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,059
took place there.

487
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:35,500
The Lord had prepared it in verse number six, and then God prepared a vehement east wind

488
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,619
and the gourd was no longer there.

489
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,820
And he was angry again.

490
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,300
And notice what is said in verse number 10, then said the Lord, thou hast had pity on

491
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,619
the gourd for the which thou hast not labored, neither made us that grow, which came up in

492
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:53,860
a night and perished in a night.

493
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,739
And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than six score thousand

494
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:00,100
persons?

495
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,260
that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand. He's referring

496
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,540
to children, by the way. That's what he's referring to, those six hundred thousand,

497
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,860
six scores, excuse me, thousand persons that cannot discern between their right

498
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,780
hand and their left hand. And then he says, and also much cattle. It's

499
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,140
interesting how that God would deal with Jonah and say that at the end of this

500
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:35,060
book, Jonah, if the children were not worth it, were the cattle worth it? Jonah

501
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,380
didn't want to go. I'm thankful that Jonah went. It took a great act of God, by

502
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:50,340
the way, to get Jonah to go. But Jonah was angry. He was exceedingly displeased and

503
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,820
very angry. This is not a response that is positive or noteworthy for us. It is

504
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,260
an example of the wrong way to respond. See, this evening when we think about

505
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,500
these three examples and then come to the New Testament, look at the life of

506
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,100
Paul, if you will. Notice with me, if you will, in Romans chapter number nine. I

507
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,260
looked at Romans 10 this morning, but look in Romans chapter number nine. I

508
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,860
want you to consider a few statements that the Apostle Paul makes with regard

509
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,660
to the information that he understood that he had received. This evening, we've

510
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,860
received information that's far greater than some city being destroyed. This

511
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,020
evening, we've received some information that's far greater than some people

512
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,940
being destroyed by some king. We understand this evening that as New

513
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:48,540
Testament believers, we're dealing with eternity. We're dealing with the

514
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,100
afterlife, if you will. If we could use that phraseology this evening, as it is

515
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,980
appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment. We find this evening

516
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,180
that the subject matter that we're dealing with is an eternal subject

517
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,740
matter. Now, I understand that when those individuals, whether it was Sodom and

518
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Gomorrah, whether it was the Assyrians and the Israelites under the leadership

519
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,060
there, the Assyrians of Haziel, or it was those people in Nineveh, we understand

520
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,540
that if they're destroyed, that they will face eternal damnation as well, or

521
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:25,940
eternal judgment, I should say. They pass on into eternity. This evening, when we

522
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,660
understand the information that has been given to us, I wonder how it is that we

523
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,620
respond. In Romans 9, in verse number 1, the Apostle Paul says, I say the truth

524
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,180
in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

525
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:48,740
that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. Paul, why

526
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:56,740
are you heavy? Why do you have the sorrow, Paul? For I could wish that myself were

527
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:04,300
accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh. When you

528
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,420
couple that truth with that in chapter number 10, in verse number 1, we read it

529
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,940
this morning, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that

530
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:20,420
they might be saved. Paul says the reason that I have this great heaviness and

531
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,060
continual sorrow in my heart is because my kinsmen, according to the flesh, are

532
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,460
lost. They're lost. And I understand that because they're lost, they're going to

533
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:39,420
spend eternity in the lake of fire. Paul understood that. And we find that it was

534
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,500
that understanding, that information that had been provided to Paul that

535
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,940
caused him to respond in the manner in which he did. You find that just after

536
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,860
his conversion, in Acts chapter number 9, that this one that was once persecuting

537
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,100
the Lord Jesus Christ, that straightway, according to Acts 9 and verse number 20,

538
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,780
he preached Christ in the synagogue, that he is the Son of God. He immediately

539
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,540
begins preaching and begins warning. Notice what he says in Acts chapter

540
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,300
number 20. Turn over there if you would. In Acts chapter number 20, we find that

541
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,980
here in this portion of Scripture that Paul is speaking to the leaders of the

542
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,180
church in Ephesus, and as he would have this conversation with them, there's much

543
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,780
that is revealed through this conversation as he would make his way to

544
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:29,780
Jerusalem to be there for the day of Pentecost. And we find here that here in

545
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,620
verse number 19, notice what it says,

546
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:40,220
serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations

547
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,900
which befell me by the laying in wait of the Jews. Notice what he says, and how I

548
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:52,060
kept back nothing that was profitable unto you. I wonder this evening, can we

549
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,820
say those words that Paul said? Could we look at someone, you remember Samuel, he

550
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,420
looked at all the people and said, have I taken anything from you that

551
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:07,980
inappropriately? I mean he stood before him and said, if so tell me. And here Paul

552
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,260
is saying, I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you. I kept back nothing

553
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:19,820
that was profitable unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly

554
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,860
and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks,

555
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:30,460
repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Why is he

556
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,900
testifying according to verse number 21? He's preaching the gospel, repentance

557
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,100
toward God and faith for our Lord Jesus Christ. Why is he preaching this message?

558
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,980
Because he understood the truth of eternity. He understood that mankind is

559
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:52,540
going to die and you're going to go to one of two places. Eternal life with the

560
00:35:52,540 --> 00:36:00,980
Lord for all of eternity, heaven, eternal judgment, the lake of fire. And Paul says

561
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,940
that he was serving the Lord. His response was that of active service, if I

562
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,220
could phrase it that way. It says in verse number 31, notice it says, therefore

563
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,740
watch and remember that by the space of three years, notice what he says, I ceased

564
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:28,500
not to warn everyone night and day with tears. Do you see the compassion? Look over

565
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:36,300
at 2nd Corinthians chapter number 5. 2nd Corinthians chapter number 5,

566
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:50,460
verse number 11, you find that the first word of this verse, knowing. Remember we

567
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,220
mentioned in our study here in Genesis 18 that information is provided. There

568
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:01,740
was something that Abraham knew that God had communicated to him. And here Paul

569
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:08,900
says, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men. But we are made

570
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,900
manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your conscience. Notice skip

571
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,740
down to verse number 14, for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus

572
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,460
judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all

573
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,220
that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto

574
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,580
him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man

575
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,460
after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now

576
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,580
henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new

577
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,340
creature. Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new. And all

578
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,460
things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath

579
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,980
given to us, notice this, the ministry of reconciliation. That's been given to us,

580
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,260
this ministry of reconciliation, to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the

581
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,580
world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed

582
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:09,420
unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ. As

583
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,220
though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead be ye

584
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:23,540
reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we

585
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:29,980
might be made the righteousness of God in him. It was in the preceding chapter

586
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,700
in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4 that Paul said if our gospel be hid it is

587
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,260
hid to them that are lost. If our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost.

588
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,780
And it's in verse number 7 of that chapter 2nd Corinthians 4 he says but we

589
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,780
have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be

590
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:59,700
of God and not of us. This evening I believe that even as I mentioned at the

591
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,100
conclusion this morning that many of us we see some things in the world in which

592
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,660
we live and we would respond with compassion and the desire to help and

593
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:18,340
assist someone that may be in need. Give a helping hand if you will. We read the

594
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,380
parable there when the Lord is speaking about the the man that was there in the

595
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,940
Good Samaritan as we would refer to it as. In fact there's an interesting story

596
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,660
about a college that's no longer a college that would stand on the truth of

597
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,300
the Word of God but was a college early on in the years of this nation that

598
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,780
produced a number of of preachers. And they were given an assignment that they

599
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,140
were to go and teach on this subject of the Good Samaritan as we often would

600
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,100
refer to that portion of Scripture as. And the teacher, the professor, had set up

601
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:56,460
purposefully on the way to the class where they would make their

602
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,060
presentation about the Good Samaritan there would be one that would be lying

603
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,740
on the ground in need of assistance to find, if any, that were going to go teach on this

604
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,460
Good Samaritan would actually stop and lend a hand.

605
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,740
And it's reported that not one of the students paused to even ask if there was anything they

606
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,500
could do.

607
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,940
But they're going to teach on the Good Samaritan.

608
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,580
Remember, if you read the passage of Scripture, there's one that passes by, I'm going to go

609
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,380
on the other side because I don't want to be bothered by this, and the Samaritan comes

610
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,460
along and he takes care of, so on and so forth.

611
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,860
I believe that most of us here, I would say all of us this evening, we like to lend a

612
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,060
hand to an individual, help them out.

613
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:43,700
If there was some known danger that was going to take place, somehow you were made aware

614
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:50,300
of a plot of some evil individual that was going to bring some great level of harm upon

615
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,980
a group of individuals.

616
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,780
I believe that most of us this evening would stand up and try to make the authorities aware

617
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:06,220
of the impending judgment or danger, feeling as if we were doing the right thing and trying

618
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,020
to give somebody the information that had been given to us.

619
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Does that make sense?

620
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:22,220
But somehow, some way, in our society we've kind of lost our way of understanding the

621
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:27,500
seriousness of eternity and responding to the information that has been given to us

622
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
in proper way.

623
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:41,780
Revelation chapter number 20 contains within just a few verses of Scripture

624
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,140
a verse that will cause us to rejoice greatly, followed by a series of verses that would

625
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,340
cause us to weep.

626
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,620
The verse that would cause us to rejoice greatly, and the devil that deceived them,

627
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,740
verse number 10, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the

628
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,540
false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.

629
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,900
Oh man, that'll cause you to rejoice, amen?

630
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,440
The next scene in Revelation chapter number 20 is the great white throne.

631
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,300
The Bible says in verse number 11 that John is speaking, it says, I saw a great white

632
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:26,060
throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and

633
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,340
there was found no place for them.

634
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,460
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened.

635
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,800
And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out

636
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,660
of those things which were written in the books according to their works.

637
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:49,300
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead

638
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,620
which were in them.

639
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,740
They were judged, every man, according to their works.

640
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,420
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

641
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,020
This is the second death.

642
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:11,100
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

643
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,020
That's going to happen one day.

644
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:22,340
And God has made us aware of that judgment that will come upon mankind who does not receive

645
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,260
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

646
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,660
I understand this evening that we can't make anyone believe the gospel.

647
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,140
If it's a forced conversion, I would question the authenticity of the conversion.

648
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,740
Does that make sense?

649
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,340
We don't believe in conversion by force.

650
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,540
We believe that someone is confronted with the truth of the gospel.

651
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,080
They place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

652
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:58,980
But this evening, we as the people of God have been given some information.

653
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,460
And this passage of Scripture is a passage that I believe truly would do us well to read

654
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:15,400
on a regular basis, to give us a tender heart, a desire to see lost men saved.

655
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,140
Often as Dean will close a service in prayer, he'll make note something to this effect that

656
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:28,060
every person that we see is either going to heaven or hell.

657
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,100
Something like that, right Dean?

658
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:41,340
And it helps us to be mindful of the people that we come into contact with, of their eternity.

659
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,020
Abraham was not given the information so that he could go warn the people of Sodom and Gomorrah

660
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,220
of impending judgment.

661
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,700
It was not his role, it was not his responsibility to go into the city of Sodom and Gomorrah

662
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,140
and to preach or to deliver some message to them.

663
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,660
But God is revealing to Abraham that which He intends to do, the judgment that was to

664
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,100
come upon those cities and those peoples.

665
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:14,820
We find that Abraham responded with intercession.

666
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,740
This evening, God has given us information, but He's also giving us instruction.

667
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,980
We are to go and bear the news.

668
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,660
To spread the tidings.

669
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,140
To shout it from the rooftop, amen?

670
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:38,700
Send the light, the blessed gospel light, in this evening.

671
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,560
We know how some individuals responded to some information that was given, but for us

672
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:51,180
as New Testament believers here in 2021, God's given us information with regard to the eternal

673
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,180
soul of mankind.

674
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,540
Man's going to live forever either in heaven or in the lake of fire.

675
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,940
In this evening, how do we respond to that information?

676
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:14,380
I've had people say, it breaks my heart, when a saved person would have a response to someone

677
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:19,620
that is exceedingly sinful that they deserve the judgment that they're going to receive.

678
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh, it breaks my heart.

679
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,420
Because God has given us a truth that I hope would cause us to say, I want to give them

680
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,220
the truth.

681
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,660
So that they could know that they could be saved.

682
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:40,260
Oh, but they're so wicked, ungodly.

683
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:48,220
But for the grace of God, we too deserve the lake of fire.

684
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:55,740
Somebody told us, and who are we to judge whether someone is deserving of anything?

685
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,700
Because we certainly are undeserving.

686
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,140
The reality this evening is that we have a message to proclaim.

687
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,540
And I understand that it's not always received.

688
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,060
I understand that there are individuals that say, hey, you can't talk about that.

689
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,460
You can't talk about this.

690
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,860
Very non-grammatically correct, just throw that junk out the window.

691
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,540
Because people are talking about all kinds of things today that they never used to talk

692
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,140
about.

693
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,580
And it's about time that the people of God stand up and begin to share the truth of the

694
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,580
Word of God.

695
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,140
Oh, we may be mocked.

696
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,660
We may be ridiculed.

697
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,100
But our duty is to simply give the truth.

698
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,980
And this evening, as we would think about the response of intercession, though someone

699
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,460
may say, I don't want to hear that, you can't talk to me about that anymore, what would

700
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,900
prevent us from praying for that individual?

701
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,900
The Holy Spirit of God would use the Word of God to convict them of their sin and of

702
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,020
their need for the Savior.

703
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:08,940
We're living in a day where God's people need to stand up and proclaim truth.

704
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,580
We need to respond to the information that God has given us with activity, such as Paul

705
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,580
did.

706
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,980
Paul said, I kept nothing.

707
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,380
I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

708
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,060
In other words, I gave it my all.

709
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,260
And if you read and study the life of the Apostle Paul, you could see that he wasn't

710
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:36,100
just writing a good article for himself to make himself look good.

711
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,140
He truly surrendered all.

712
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,700
And he was a man that wept with tears, mourning night and day.

713
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,980
Oh, that God would use us.

714
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,620
Abraham was given some information.

715
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,020
We as the people of God have been given some information.

716
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,860
That information that we have been given must be responded to.

717
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,340
And I hope that God would use us, empower us.

718
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,020
We go with Him.

719
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,620
He said, I will be with you.

720
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,620
What a joy.

721
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,500
We'll do it in our own power.

722
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:18,540
We go prayed up in the power of the Holy Spirit of God with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

723
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:23,860
So this evening, how will we respond to the information that's been provided to us in

724
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,980
the Word of God with regard to the eternal things?

725
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,260
Father, we love you.

726
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,900
We thank you for loving us.

727
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:40,260
We thank you that someone was willing to give us the gospel.

728
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:48,100
Lord, I pray tonight that as we look at the truth of your Word with regard to the impending

729
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:54,260
judgment of these cities that were exceeding sinful, the judgment that was coming and the

730
00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:00,060
response of Abraham, Lord, I pray this evening that as we seek to make some application

731
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:07,420
in our lives, we understand that You have given us truth.

732
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,220
The events recorded in Your Word will come to pass.

733
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:18,620
This great white throne judgment will take place.

734
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:25,460
Our neighbors and our co-workers, our friends and our family members are either going to

735
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,380
heaven or the lake of fire.

736
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:37,900
And I pray, God, that You would give us a passion for souls.

737
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,300
Help us to not be fearful.

738
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,760
Help us to not have concern about what someone may think, but have a greater concern of obedience

739
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,540
to You.

740
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:59,700
Help us to have that perspective that is mentioned there by the Apostle Paul.

741
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,860
I pray that You'd work in our midst tonight, and we'll thank You for the decisions that

742
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,860
are made.

743
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,860
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

744
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,860
Would You stand with me?

745
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

746
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,740
Kimberly is going to play quietly on the piano.

747
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,220
Just wonder tonight...
