00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Genesis, chapter number 18, we'll finish the chapter this evening, be looking at verse

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.399
16 down through verse number 33.

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:20.520
Genesis 18, verses 16 through 33, in verse number 16, the Bible says, and the men rose

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.719
up from the fence and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to bring them on

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.719
the way.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:33.000
And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.880
Notice in verse 32, and he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.520
this once.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.819
Peradventure, ten shall be found there.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.439
And he, the Lord, said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.659
I'm going to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, I Will Not Destroy

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.060
It for Ten's Sake.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.979
It was back in Genesis, chapter number 13, that we learned of the strife between the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.980
herdmen of Abraham and the herdmen of Lot, and we understand that that strife led to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.739
a discussion, and Abraham had given Lot the option as to where he would like to go and

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.160
what land it was that he would like to have.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.540
And we find that the result of that discussion was Lot chose all the plain of Jordan to be

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.440
his home.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.120
Soon thereafter, we found that the Bible recorded for us a battle that took place, and in that

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.319
battle, Lot and many were taken captive.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.120
The Bible tells us that Lot now dwelt in the land of Sodom, and he had been taken captive

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.000
with his goods and his family and many others that were taken captive as a result of that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
battle.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.720
And it was Abraham that rose up, he and the trained servants from his home, and they went

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.099
and they recovered all, the Bible says, and there was a great delivery, and we find that

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.819
it was there in that passage of Scripture that the Lord had the opportunity, or excuse

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.379
me, that Abraham had the opportunity to meet Melchizedek, and we understood of that great

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.940
meeting and the way in which the Lord revealed to Abraham that he is the most high God, El

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.940
Elyon.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.860
And we know that from that time, as we had been introduced to those particular subjects

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.720
and understood the traveling of these individuals, that many years have now passed, and as we

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.199
have looked at the last several chapters of the book of Genesis, we find that through

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.880
those years and the events that had taken place, we've not really heard anything of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.080
Lot whatsoever, nor have we heard anything of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.600
But yet we find that the wickedness of these cities was known by God and judgment was coming.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.360
We're mindful of what the wise men would say in Proverbs chapter number 14, in verse

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.399
number 34, when he said, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:02:55.399 --> 00:03:00.960
We find here in this text of Scripture that God is going to reveal some things to Abraham,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.839
and we find that Abraham is going to respond to that which is given to him.

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.919
If you are taking notes this evening, I simply have, I have two points this evening.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.639
Number one in your notes, information is provided.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.759
Notice with me in verses 16 through 22 that God provides Abraham with some information.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:25.559
We could ask this question at the onset of the message this evening, why is it that God

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.639
would tell Abraham what he would tell him?

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:34.080
Well, in verse number 16, we find that the Bible says that the men rose up from the fence,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.960
they looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.320
And the Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do, seeing that Abraham

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.800
shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.720
blessed in him.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.600
You remember the promises that had been made to Abraham with regard to a seed and with

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.880
regard to a land, and we find that God is understanding and giving this information,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.320
and really we find that these verses of Scripture are given to us in verses 16 through 19 so

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.040
that we could have an understanding as to why God is giving this information to Abraham.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.679
We find that he notes about the mighty nation that would become, we find also that in verse

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.480
number 19, notice the first phrase, for I know him.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.119
And you read the book of Revelation in chapters 2 and 3, and you read those letters to the

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:36.119
seven churches of Asia, and you find that repeated throughout those portions of Scripture,

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.679
I know thy works.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.200
God knows everything about us.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.200
And here he says, for I know him, notice what he says, that he, Abraham, will command his

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.959
children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:58.679
To do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:01.239
spoken of him.

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:04.959
I believe that as you look at these verses of Scripture, it helps us to have a little

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:10.320
insight to further revelation that we'll have in the Word of God, where God refers to Abraham

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.940
as being the friend of God.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.359
In fact, if you note over in James chapter number 2 and verse number 23, the Bible says

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:26.119
this, it says, and the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:32.040
was imputed unto him for righteousness, that's a reference to Genesis 15, and he, Abraham,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.519
was called the friend of God.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:40.959
We find not only why God would tell Abraham this information, but what is it that God

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:42.720
told Abraham.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.920
In verse number 20, we find that here becomes the focus of the information that is provided

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920
to Abraham.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:57.559
It says, the Lord said, the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah God is speaking, and He says, in verse

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:08.119
number 20, because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous.

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:12.859
We find that it says, I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:18.799
to the cry of it which has come upon to me, and if not, I will know.

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:23.559
You'll remember that it was back in Genesis chapter number 13, that discussion that took

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:30.600
place between Abraham and Lot after the contention, the strife with the herdmen, and the Bible

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.760
tells us that when Lot chose all of the plain of Jordan, it says in verse number 12 of Genesis

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.720
13, that Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.959
and pitched his tent toward Sodom, but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.119
the Lord exceedingly.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.359
We understand here this evening that as we look at this information that is provided

00:06:55.359 --> 00:07:00.579
to Abraham, that Abraham is made aware of the sinfulness of Sodom.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:06.640
No doubt in my mind that Abraham had an awareness of what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.760
as we would see in his response to that which is given.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.440
He understood what was going on in those cities, and we find that as God would reveal the sinfulness

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.959
of Sodom, that God also speaks to Abraham about the pending judgment.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.119
How do we know that God is revealing to Abraham of this pending judgment?

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:32.679
Well, you'll note that the immediate response of Abraham, as it's recorded in verse number

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.200
23, is he says,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.279
"'Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?'

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.119
Why would Abraham ask that question?

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:44.079
Because God had revealed that judgment was coming.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:48.920
God had revealed that they were going to be punished for their sin.'"

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.399
I'm so thankful that we serve a God who is holy, and is gracious and merciful, and often

00:07:55.399 --> 00:08:00.040
times as the people of God will speak of His long-suffering, but we understand this evening

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.040
that our God is just, and He is the righteous judge.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:10.959
And we find this evening that He, as the righteous judge, He will mete out judgment.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:15.679
And we find that the Word of God reveals to us throughout the pages of Scripture the

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.880
way in which mankind will face judgment.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.239
And here in this portion of Scripture, we find that these individuals, the inhabitants

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:29.880
of these lands, the Sodom and Gomorrah and the accompanying cities, that God had been

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.400
long-suffering with them.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.799
The Bible tells us in chapter number 13 that they were exceeding sinful.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.599
They were wicked.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:44.039
We understand that they had existed for a period of time before that reference in chapter

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:50.359
13, and we find that they were an exceeding sinful people, and a number of years have

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:56.400
passed between Genesis 13 and Genesis 18.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.359
God's judgment, God's justice, was to be poured out upon the inhabitants because of their

00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:02.359
wickedness.

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:09.359
See, there's coming a day in which mankind will face the judgment of God Almighty.

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:15.479
I've seen, I have witnessed firsthand individuals that have worn paraphernalia, maybe on a ball

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:20.760
cap or on a shirt that says, only God can judge me.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.599
And when I've seen individuals wearing that paraphernalia, the last time I saw someone

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:30.760
wearing it was in a Walmart here not long ago, and as I witnessed that person wearing

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.559
that statement upon their clothing, I was broken in my heart understanding that, sir,

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:42.039
one day you will stand before God Almighty.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.080
Judgment is real.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.000
And here, God is sharing with Abraham about the judgment, the pending judgment upon the

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.359
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and those in that area.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:57.840
We understand here in verse number 21 that He gives this truth, and verse 22, and the

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.000
men turned their faces from fence.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.200
and went towards Sodom."

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.480
Remember, as we studied the first section

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.639
of chapter number 18, there were three,

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.520
the two angels and the Lord Jehovah was there.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.560
And it says here at the end of verse number 22,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.279
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:17.959
So if you can get in your mind's eye what's taking place

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:21.520
and Abraham had ministered, they had had a meal,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.440
as we mentioned the beginning of chapter number 18

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.120
last Sunday evening, and as they continued

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.399
and had that feast and they finished,

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:31.040
God repeated to Abraham the promise

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.360
of a son at this appointed time.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.919
Sarah laughed in Abraham's question.

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:38.159
And now they're rising up to leave.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.599
They have this conversation.

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:42.400
The two angels proceed to go towards Sodom.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.319
And the Bible says in verse number 22,

00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:48.880
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.759
We find that in the next verses of scripture

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:55.400
is really what we see as the response of Abraham

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.319
to that which had been given.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.959
The information is provided.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.439
I've made note this evening that God gave Abraham

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:03.319
this information.

00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:05.559
He calls him the friend of God.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:08.480
I want you to be mindful of the fact that in like manner,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.040
just as Abraham was made aware of some information here

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.800
in Genesis chapter number 18,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800
we find that as the children of God,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.760
we too have been given some information.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.519
In John chapter number 15, I want to draw your attention

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.559
to what the Lord Jesus Christ says

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:26.599
to these disciples in John 15.

00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:31.080
You understand the timeline perhaps of the book of John,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.639
and it would just be a short period of time

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:35.519
before the Lord Jesus Christ would go

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.120
to the cross of Calvary.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.800
He had been giving the truth.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.760
In chapter number 13, he washed the feet of the disciples

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.959
and told them that he would soon depart.

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:45.760
He told them, let not your heart be troubled.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.879
He's given them all of this information

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:51.400
in these few chapters, in chapters 13 through 16.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.120
And we find here in verse number 14 of John 15,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.959
notice what Jesus says to his disciples.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.760
Ye are my friends.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.440
If you do whatsoever I command you,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.519
henceforth I call you not servants.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.679
Notice this, for the servant knoweth not

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:15.360
what his Lord doeth, but I have called you friends.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.559
For all things that I have heard of my father,

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:22.080
I have made known unto you.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.080
There were some things, some information

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.440
that was provided to the disciples

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.880
that others were not aware of.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.119
We find that for us as the people of God,

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:32.520
the children of God, we understand

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.759
the Bible tells us that the Scriptures have been given

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.279
to us the Holy Spirit of God who indwells us

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:43.240
as the individual believer, that he is our teacher.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.520
We understand that the Bible would tell us

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.279
of the unregenerate man that they cannot understand

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.600
the things of the Spirit of God.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.240
They do not understand the Bible.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.059
I've had people tell me before, I

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:55.940
just don't understand it, I don't get it.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.020
Well, 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.380
says, the natural man receiveth not the things

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.460
of the Spirit of God.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:01.960
Why?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.580
For they are foolishness unto him,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:09.860
neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.220
If you've been born again, you have the Holy Spirit of God

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.419
that indwells you, and the Holy Spirit is the teacher.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.339
You say, well, I don't understand everything.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.580
I understand, join the club, amen.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.820
But the reality is that we dig in

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.820
and we continue seeking to grow and learn,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.899
and we have the opportunity to ask the author

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:32.059
to pray for that truth would be given to us.

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:35.660
Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.619
of thy law.

00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:38.779
Teach me thy ways.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:41.300
We find that God would answer that prayer,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.419
and we have in our hands this evening

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:47.139
a precious book that contains much information that God

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:50.940
has given to us as his people.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.339
This evening, information is provided to Abraham,

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:57.580
and we know how Abraham would respond

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.580
if you're taking notes.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.740
Number two, intercession is recorded.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.339
Information is provided, and intercession is recorded.

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:09.660
According to verse number 22, two of these men,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.059
as I mentioned already, proceeded towards Sodom,

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:13.940
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.899
And I want you to notice what is said in verse number 23.

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:20.459
And Abraham drew near.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.220
The first song that we sang this evening,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.339
I did not pick the songs.

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:25.859
Draw me nearer.

00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:27.700
Isn't that wonderful?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.420
And how appropriate to be mindful of this reality

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.619
that Abraham drew near.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:36.940
What a great privilege for us as the people of God

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.179
to draw near to the Lord.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.500
The psalmist said in Psalm 78, excuse me,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.480
Psalm 73 in verse number 28, notice

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.820
what the psalmist says here in this portion of scripture

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.859
with regard to drawing near unto the Lord.

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:52.420
The Bible says this, but it is good for me

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.220
to draw near to God.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.899
I have put my trust in the Lord God

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:02.700
that I may declare all thy works.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.299
Oh, it was good for me, it's good for the psalmist,

00:15:05.299 --> 00:15:10.500
it's good for you and I to draw near unto the Lord.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.179
We find that we'll visit Psalm 73

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.459
near the end of our message again,

00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:17.059
so you might want to put a bookmark there.

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:18.820
We'll be back there in just a little while,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.980
but I want to take note of a New Testament truth

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.100
as well in James chapter number 4

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.380
in verses 7 and 8 where the Bible says this,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.859
submit yourselves therefore to God,

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.899
resist the devil and he will flee from you.

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:32.459
Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you.

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:33.980
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners,

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.380
and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.459
What a great privilege.

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:42.220
Do you see in your mind's eye this evening

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.500
how that these two angels continue on their way to Sodom

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.299
and the Lord stays and Abraham draws near to the Lord.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:54.140
And we see the intercession that is recorded.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.739
We find here that Abraham begins with the number 50

00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:00.859
and he'll end in verse number 32 with the number 10.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.420
What is it that he's praying?

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.619
Notice at the end of verse number 23,

00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:09.619
will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:12.500
Peradventure, verse 24,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.299
there be 50 righteous within the city.

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:18.260
Wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.820
for the 50 righteous that are therein?

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.220
That be far from thee to do after this manner,

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.660
to slay the righteous with the wicked,

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.940
and that the righteous should be as the wicked,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.220
that be far from thee.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.980
Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.540
You notice what Abraham's recognizing here.

00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:41.220
He's recognizing that God is the judge of all the earth.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.820
And in fact, God will do that which is right.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.019
And we find that here, Abraham begins to plead,

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:51.980
to intercede on the behalf of the inhabitants

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.140
of Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.980
No doubt in my mind that Abraham is aware of the fact

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.899
that Lot and the family live there in Sodom.

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:06.739
And he begins to intercede.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.820
We notice the response.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.660
It's a response of intercession.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.100
And the Lord said in verse 26,

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:19.660
if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.619
then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.459
And Abraham answered and said, verse 27,

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:32.739
behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord,

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:35.660
which in but dust and ashes,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.179
peradventure there shall lack five of the 50 righteous.

00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:43.339
Will thou destroy all the city for lack of five?

00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:46.299
So he's now at 45 and he, the Lord said,

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:50.540
if I find there 40 and five, I will not destroy it.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.179
And he's speaking to him yet again and said,

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:55.140
peradventure there shall be 40 found there.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.779
He said, I will not do it for 40's sake.

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:01.140
And he said unto him, oh, let not the Lord be angry

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.980
and I will speak peradventure there shall 30 be found there.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.459
And he said, I will not do it if I find 30 there.

00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:12.779
And he said, behold now,

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:15.660
I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.179
peradventure there should be 20 found there.

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:21.619
And he said, I will not destroy it for 20's sake.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.739
Verse 32, and he said, oh, let not the Lord be angry

00:18:25.739 --> 00:18:29.059
and I will speak yet but this once.

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:33.580
Peradventure 10 shall be found there.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.500
And he, the Lord said, I will not destroy it for 10's sake.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.219
And the Lord went his way

00:18:42.219 --> 00:18:45.340
as soon as he had left communing with Abraham

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.299
and Abraham returned unto his place.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.780
The interaction, the discussion is now ended

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.900
according to verse 33, the Lord goes on

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.020
and we find that Abraham returns unto his place

00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:01.260
and as we would know in verse number 33,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.780
the end of this discussion,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.900
the intercession that we're mentioning this evening

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.099
is it comes to a conclusion,

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.659
but we find that beginning in verse number 23

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:12.859
and going down through verse number 32

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:14.739
that Abraham is interceding,

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:16.979
we find that it's quite obvious

00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:20.460
that his concern for people is on display.

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:26.539
The reality is that these people were wicked sinners.

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:28.739
The reality is that this has something

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.659
that Abraham had known for some period of time

00:19:31.659 --> 00:19:34.099
where it says that the men of Sodom were wicked

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:36.380
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.020
We find that it was there in chapter number 18

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.299
that God says about their sin being great

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:44.460
and it's very grievous.

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.460
And yet, Abraham does not say,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.099
give them what they deserve, Lord.

00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:51.419
I mean, strike them dead.

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:52.820
No, no.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.179
He's interceding for them.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.619
He's interceding on their behalf.

00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:00.020
He's responding to the information.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.180
that he receives with intercession.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.380
You see the heart of Abraham on display in this portion of Scripture.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:15.780
His concern for individuals and for the destruction of the righteous with the wicked.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.860
As I begin to think about Abraham and his response here in this portion of Scripture,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.020
and I begin to think about the whole of Scripture and understanding the historical context in

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:31.320
the next couple of weeks, we'll begin looking at the next chapters and the events that unfold

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.180
and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and we'll begin to see all of those things

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:42.540
and many references in the New Testament with regard to this particular historical fact.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:49.540
But just for a moment this evening, I want to take some time to try to make some application

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.480
with regard to the response of Abraham.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.880
How he responds to the information that he receives.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.640
In fact, this evening I believe that God has given us the opportunity to look at a number

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.960
of references throughout the Word of God of individual believers that had been given information

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.720
from God Almighty and how they responded to that information that was given.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.920
We find here with Abraham that it was a response of intercession.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.320
It was a response of Abraham pleading and saying,

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.920
would you destroy the righteous with the wicked?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.640
And we find that the righteousness, remember we mentioned already in Proverbs chapter number

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.000
14 and verse number 34, righteousness exalteth a nation, sin is a reproach to any people.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.320
You note that God said that if he found 50 within the city, according to verse number

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:48.200
26, then will I spare all the place for their sakes.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.560
Staying the hand of judgment, if you will.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.360
I want you to think about Elisha, turn to the book of 2 Kings, if you will, in chapter

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:03.000
number 8.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.800
Eventually we're going to make it to the New Testament and look at the Apostle Paul.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.880
I have a few examples from the Old Testament here.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.480
What was it that Abraham was told was going to happen impending judgment upon these cities,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.280
Sodom and Gomorrah, and this destruction because of their sin?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.520
And he intercedes.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.560
We find that it's here in 2 Kings chapter number 8.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.760
Notice what is said, I'm going to read verse number 13 and then we're going to go back

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.160
and read the preceding verses, but in verse number 13 of 2 Kings chapter 8, the Bible

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.600
says, and Haziel said, but what is thy servant, he's speaking to Elisha, what is thy servant,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.080
a dog, that he should do this great thing?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.040
And Elisha answered, notice what he says, the Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.240
king over Syria.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.360
Not only that he would be king over Syria, but all of the destruction that he would bring

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.160
upon the people of God.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.020
It's mentioned in verse number 12, and Haziel said, why weepeth my Lord?

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.860
And he, Elisha, answered, because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.900
of Israel, their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:18.940
with the sword, and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.620
And that's terrible.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.340
Haziel says, why?

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.340
Why is it?

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.900
I mean, what am I, thy servant, a dog, and that I should do this thing?

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.460
And Elisha says, no, the Lord hath showed me.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.360
The Lord had given me this information.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.540
The Lord revealed to me what's going to happen.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.340
And how is it that Elisha responded to that which he heard?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.180
You notice in verse number 11, and he settled his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.180
and the man of God wept.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.820
The man of God wept.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.220
Elisha wept.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.460
Why?

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.500
Because he knew what Haziel, the king of Syria, was going to do to the inhabitants

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.420
of Israel, to his countrymen.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.580
And he's understanding that this information has been provided.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.620
The Lord hath showed me.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.300
The Lord hath revealed to me what you're going to do, and here's what you're going to do,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.140
and it caused the man of God to weep.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140
He wept.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.220
I want you to think about Jonah.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.220
The book of Jonah.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.220
The book of Jonah.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.620
Many of us are familiar with the book of Jonah.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:39.140
We understand that the Lord spoke to Jonah, and you find that God said to Jonah, arise

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.620
and go to Nineveh.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.940
In verse number 2 of chapter number 1, that great city, and cry against it.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940
Why?

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.540
Because wickedness has come up before me.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.460
We know I don't have time this evening to go through the entirety of the book of Jonah,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:02.620
but we understand that Jonah went in the exact opposite direction of where he was told to

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.460
go.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.460
Jonah fled.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.460
He got on a ship.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.940
He paid the fare.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.940
He's trying to get away from that which God had instructed him to do.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.980
You understand that God had given Jonah this assignment to go to Nineveh.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.620
If you would understand the timing of the book of Jonah, and understanding all that

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.700
was taking place, the Assyrians were the world power, and we find that just shortly after

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:33.780
the prophecy and the time of Jonah's ministry that the Assyrians would take captive Israel.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.780
They were a hated people.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.540
I mean, just being honest.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:43.500
There was great enmity between the Assyrians and basically anybody else, and Nineveh's

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.500
the capital.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.460
It's a wicked city.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.060
It's a great city.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.100
Jonah goes his way.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.940
You understand there's a great storm and a great fish that the Lord prepared, and in

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:01.740
chapter number 3 we find that the Lord spoke to Jonah again and gave him the same assignment.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:08.620
We find that Jonah went and he came into the city, and the Bible says there in verse number

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.620
4 of chapter 3,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.860
Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried and said,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:19.140
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:27.180
The people responded with repentance, and the judgment was stayed.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.880
I believe with all of my heart that if the people of Nineveh would not have repented

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.940
in forty days, they would have been destroyed, because that's what God said.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:43.780
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.780
Why is it that Jonah fled?

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.820
Well, when you read chapter number 4, you understand why it is that Jonah fled.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.060
If I could summarize it this way, basically Jonah was happy that they were going to face

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.340
judgment.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.340
Jonah knew.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.540
Notice what it says in Jonah 4 and verse number 1.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.740
It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.020
Why?

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.260
Can you understand what happens in Nineveh?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.380
This is a revival.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.340
They believe the message of God.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:19.340
They repented in sackcloth and ashes, I mean, from the greatest to the least, and it's amazing

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.860
as you read chapter number 3, verses 5 through verse number 10.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:30.300
The Bible tells us right after this great revival that the preacher Jonah is displeased

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.180
and very angry.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.060
Notice verse number 2.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:42.060
He Jonah prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.580
when I was yet in my country?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.500
Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.500
Why?

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:55.220
For I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.060
and repentest thee of the evil.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.660
For now, O Lord, take I beseech thee my life for me, for it is better for me to die than

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.420
to live.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.580
Jonah says, let them get what they deserve.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.300
I mean, he didn't want to go and preach.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.900
He didn't want to go and deliver the message.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.900
Why?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.940
Because he knew that God was gracious and merciful, slow to anger.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.300
By the way, all of those things are reasons that we as believers rejoice.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
Are they not?

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.620
Aren't you thankful this evening that God is gracious towards you?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.059
And merciful towards you?

00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:34.020
And slow to anger towards you?

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.460
I mean, I'm thankful this evening that our God is ready to pardon, as I mentioned on

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.460
Wednesday evening.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.020
We look at that portion of Scripture from Luke 11.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.220
Oh, our God is ready to pardon, He's ready to forgive.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.260
His mercy endureth forever.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.220
These are reasons to rejoice.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.540
And Jonah is saying, I like those things for me, but not for them.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.140
I mean, isn't that what's saying?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:05.100
By the way, this isn't a good response, right?

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.380
The response of Abraham, to intercede.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:15.140
The response of Elisha, to the information that he had received, to weep.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.700
The response of Jonah, I'm going the other way.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.820
I don't want to take the message.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.260
Now, he eventually goes and takes the message, but then he's angry about it.

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:29.059
Of course, we know that at the end of the chapter, there was the gourd and all that

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:30.059
took place there.

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:35.500
The Lord had prepared it in verse number six, and then God prepared a vehement east wind

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.619
and the gourd was no longer there.

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:39.820
And he was angry again.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.300
And notice what is said in verse number 10, then said the Lord, thou hast had pity on

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:50.619
the gourd for the which thou hast not labored, neither made us that grow, which came up in

00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:53.860
a night and perished in a night.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.739
And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than six score thousand

00:29:59.739 --> 00:30:00.100
persons?

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.260
that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand. He's referring

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.540
to children, by the way. That's what he's referring to, those six hundred thousand,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.860
six scores, excuse me, thousand persons that cannot discern between their right

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:20.780
hand and their left hand. And then he says, and also much cattle. It's

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.140
interesting how that God would deal with Jonah and say that at the end of this

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:35.060
book, Jonah, if the children were not worth it, were the cattle worth it? Jonah

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.380
didn't want to go. I'm thankful that Jonah went. It took a great act of God, by

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:50.340
the way, to get Jonah to go. But Jonah was angry. He was exceedingly displeased and

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.820
very angry. This is not a response that is positive or noteworthy for us. It is

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:03.260
an example of the wrong way to respond. See, this evening when we think about

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.500
these three examples and then come to the New Testament, look at the life of

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.100
Paul, if you will. Notice with me, if you will, in Romans chapter number nine. I

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.260
looked at Romans 10 this morning, but look in Romans chapter number nine. I

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.860
want you to consider a few statements that the Apostle Paul makes with regard

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.660
to the information that he understood that he had received. This evening, we've

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.860
received information that's far greater than some city being destroyed. This

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:36.020
evening, we've received some information that's far greater than some people

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.940
being destroyed by some king. We understand this evening that as New

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:48.540
Testament believers, we're dealing with eternity. We're dealing with the

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.100
afterlife, if you will. If we could use that phraseology this evening, as it is

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:58.980
appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment. We find this evening

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.180
that the subject matter that we're dealing with is an eternal subject

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.740
matter. Now, I understand that when those individuals, whether it was Sodom and

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.740
Gomorrah, whether it was the Assyrians and the Israelites under the leadership

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.060
there, the Assyrians of Haziel, or it was those people in Nineveh, we understand

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.540
that if they're destroyed, that they will face eternal damnation as well, or

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:25.940
eternal judgment, I should say. They pass on into eternity. This evening, when we

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.660
understand the information that has been given to us, I wonder how it is that we

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.620
respond. In Romans 9, in verse number 1, the Apostle Paul says, I say the truth

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.180
in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:48.740
that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. Paul, why

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:56.740
are you heavy? Why do you have the sorrow, Paul? For I could wish that myself were

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:04.300
accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh. When you

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.420
couple that truth with that in chapter number 10, in verse number 1, we read it

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.940
this morning, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:20.420
they might be saved. Paul says the reason that I have this great heaviness and

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:25.060
continual sorrow in my heart is because my kinsmen, according to the flesh, are

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:31.460
lost. They're lost. And I understand that because they're lost, they're going to

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:39.420
spend eternity in the lake of fire. Paul understood that. And we find that it was

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.500
that understanding, that information that had been provided to Paul that

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.940
caused him to respond in the manner in which he did. You find that just after

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.860
his conversion, in Acts chapter number 9, that this one that was once persecuting

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.100
the Lord Jesus Christ, that straightway, according to Acts 9 and verse number 20,

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:02.780
he preached Christ in the synagogue, that he is the Son of God. He immediately

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.540
begins preaching and begins warning. Notice what he says in Acts chapter

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.300
number 20. Turn over there if you would. In Acts chapter number 20, we find that

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.980
here in this portion of Scripture that Paul is speaking to the leaders of the

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.180
church in Ephesus, and as he would have this conversation with them, there's much

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.780
that is revealed through this conversation as he would make his way to

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:29.780
Jerusalem to be there for the day of Pentecost. And we find here that here in

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.620
verse number 19, notice what it says,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:40.220
serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.900
which befell me by the laying in wait of the Jews. Notice what he says, and how I

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:52.060
kept back nothing that was profitable unto you. I wonder this evening, can we

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.820
say those words that Paul said? Could we look at someone, you remember Samuel, he

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.420
looked at all the people and said, have I taken anything from you that

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:07.980
inappropriately? I mean he stood before him and said, if so tell me. And here Paul

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:14.260
is saying, I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you. I kept back nothing

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.820
that was profitable unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.860
and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks,

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:30.460
repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Why is he

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.900
testifying according to verse number 21? He's preaching the gospel, repentance

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.100
toward God and faith for our Lord Jesus Christ. Why is he preaching this message?

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:44.980
Because he understood the truth of eternity. He understood that mankind is

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:52.540
going to die and you're going to go to one of two places. Eternal life with the

00:35:52.540 --> 00:36:00.980
Lord for all of eternity, heaven, eternal judgment, the lake of fire. And Paul says

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.940
that he was serving the Lord. His response was that of active service, if I

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:12.220
could phrase it that way. It says in verse number 31, notice it says, therefore

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:17.740
watch and remember that by the space of three years, notice what he says, I ceased

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:28.500
not to warn everyone night and day with tears. Do you see the compassion? Look over

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:36.300
at 2nd Corinthians chapter number 5. 2nd Corinthians chapter number 5,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:50.460
verse number 11, you find that the first word of this verse, knowing. Remember we

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.220
mentioned in our study here in Genesis 18 that information is provided. There

00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:01.740
was something that Abraham knew that God had communicated to him. And here Paul

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:08.900
says, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men. But we are made

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.900
manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your conscience. Notice skip

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.740
down to verse number 14, for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.460
judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.220
that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.580
him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.460
after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.580
henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.340
creature. Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new. And all

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:45.460
things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.980
given to us, notice this, the ministry of reconciliation. That's been given to us,

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.260
this ministry of reconciliation, to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.580
world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:09.420
unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ. As

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:16.220
though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead be ye

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:23.540
reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:29.980
might be made the righteousness of God in him. It was in the preceding chapter

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.700
in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4 that Paul said if our gospel be hid it is

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.260
hid to them that are lost. If our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.780
And it's in verse number 7 of that chapter 2nd Corinthians 4 he says but we

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:50.780
have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:59.700
of God and not of us. This evening I believe that even as I mentioned at the

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:05.100
conclusion this morning that many of us we see some things in the world in which

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.660
we live and we would respond with compassion and the desire to help and

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:18.340
assist someone that may be in need. Give a helping hand if you will. We read the

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.380
parable there when the Lord is speaking about the the man that was there in the

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.940
Good Samaritan as we would refer to it as. In fact there's an interesting story

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.660
about a college that's no longer a college that would stand on the truth of

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.300
the Word of God but was a college early on in the years of this nation that

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.780
produced a number of of preachers. And they were given an assignment that they

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.140
were to go and teach on this subject of the Good Samaritan as we often would

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:50.100
refer to that portion of Scripture as. And the teacher, the professor, had set up

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:56.460
purposefully on the way to the class where they would make their

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.060
presentation about the Good Samaritan there would be one that would be lying

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.740
on the ground in need of assistance to find, if any, that were going to go teach on this

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.460
Good Samaritan would actually stop and lend a hand.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:15.740
And it's reported that not one of the students paused to even ask if there was anything they

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.500
could do.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.940
But they're going to teach on the Good Samaritan.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.580
Remember, if you read the passage of Scripture, there's one that passes by, I'm going to go

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.380
on the other side because I don't want to be bothered by this, and the Samaritan comes

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.460
along and he takes care of, so on and so forth.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.860
I believe that most of us here, I would say all of us this evening, we like to lend a

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.060
hand to an individual, help them out.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:43.700
If there was some known danger that was going to take place, somehow you were made aware

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:50.300
of a plot of some evil individual that was going to bring some great level of harm upon

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.980
a group of individuals.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.780
I believe that most of us this evening would stand up and try to make the authorities aware

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:06.220
of the impending judgment or danger, feeling as if we were doing the right thing and trying

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:11.020
to give somebody the information that had been given to us.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.020
Does that make sense?

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:22.220
But somehow, some way, in our society we've kind of lost our way of understanding the

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.500
seriousness of eternity and responding to the information that has been given to us

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.500
in proper way.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:41.780
Revelation chapter number 20 contains within just a few verses of Scripture

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:47.140
a verse that will cause us to rejoice greatly, followed by a series of verses that would

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.340
cause us to weep.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:55.620
The verse that would cause us to rejoice greatly, and the devil that deceived them,

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.740
verse number 10, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:05.540
false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.900
Oh man, that'll cause you to rejoice, amen?

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:15.440
The next scene in Revelation chapter number 20 is the great white throne.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.300
The Bible says in verse number 11 that John is speaking, it says, I saw a great white

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:26.060
throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.340
there was found no place for them.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.460
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.800
And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.660
of those things which were written in the books according to their works.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:49.300
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.620
which were in them.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.740
They were judged, every man, according to their works.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.420
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.020
This is the second death.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:11.100
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:16.020
That's going to happen one day.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:22.340
And God has made us aware of that judgment that will come upon mankind who does not receive

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.260
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.660
I understand this evening that we can't make anyone believe the gospel.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.140
If it's a forced conversion, I would question the authenticity of the conversion.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.740
Does that make sense?

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.340
We don't believe in conversion by force.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.540
We believe that someone is confronted with the truth of the gospel.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:52.080
They place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:58.980
But this evening, we as the people of God have been given some information.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:05.460
And this passage of Scripture is a passage that I believe truly would do us well to read

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:15.400
on a regular basis, to give us a tender heart, a desire to see lost men saved.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:21.140
Often as Dean will close a service in prayer, he'll make note something to this effect that

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:28.060
every person that we see is either going to heaven or hell.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.100
Something like that, right Dean?

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:41.340
And it helps us to be mindful of the people that we come into contact with, of their eternity.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:48.020
Abraham was not given the information so that he could go warn the people of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.220
of impending judgment.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:55.700
It was not his role, it was not his responsibility to go into the city of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.140
and to preach or to deliver some message to them.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.660
But God is revealing to Abraham that which He intends to do, the judgment that was to

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.100
come upon those cities and those peoples.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:14.820
We find that Abraham responded with intercession.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:20.740
This evening, God has given us information, but He's also giving us instruction.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.980
We are to go and bear the news.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.660
To spread the tidings.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.140
To shout it from the rooftop, amen?

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:38.700
Send the light, the blessed gospel light, in this evening.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.560
We know how some individuals responded to some information that was given, but for us

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:51.180
as New Testament believers here in 2021, God's given us information with regard to the eternal

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.180
soul of mankind.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.540
Man's going to live forever either in heaven or in the lake of fire.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:04.940
In this evening, how do we respond to that information?

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:14.380
I've had people say, it breaks my heart, when a saved person would have a response to someone

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.620
that is exceedingly sinful that they deserve the judgment that they're going to receive.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.060
Oh, it breaks my heart.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.420
Because God has given us a truth that I hope would cause us to say, I want to give them

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.220
the truth.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.660
So that they could know that they could be saved.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:40.260
Oh, but they're so wicked, ungodly.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:48.220
But for the grace of God, we too deserve the lake of fire.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:55.740
Somebody told us, and who are we to judge whether someone is deserving of anything?

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.700
Because we certainly are undeserving.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:03.140
The reality this evening is that we have a message to proclaim.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.540
And I understand that it's not always received.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.060
I understand that there are individuals that say, hey, you can't talk about that.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.460
You can't talk about this.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:20.860
Very non-grammatically correct, just throw that junk out the window.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.540
Because people are talking about all kinds of things today that they never used to talk

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.140
about.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.580
And it's about time that the people of God stand up and begin to share the truth of the

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.580
Word of God.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.140
Oh, we may be mocked.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.660
We may be ridiculed.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.100
But our duty is to simply give the truth.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.980
And this evening, as we would think about the response of intercession, though someone

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.460
may say, I don't want to hear that, you can't talk to me about that anymore, what would

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.900
prevent us from praying for that individual?

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.900
The Holy Spirit of God would use the Word of God to convict them of their sin and of

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.020
their need for the Savior.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:08.940
We're living in a day where God's people need to stand up and proclaim truth.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:14.580
We need to respond to the information that God has given us with activity, such as Paul

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.580
did.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.980
Paul said, I kept nothing.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.380
I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.060
In other words, I gave it my all.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.260
And if you read and study the life of the Apostle Paul, you could see that he wasn't

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:36.100
just writing a good article for himself to make himself look good.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.140
He truly surrendered all.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:45.700
And he was a man that wept with tears, mourning night and day.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.980
Oh, that God would use us.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.620
Abraham was given some information.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.020
We as the people of God have been given some information.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:00.860
That information that we have been given must be responded to.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.340
And I hope that God would use us, empower us.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.020
We go with Him.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.620
He said, I will be with you.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:09.620
What a joy.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.500
We'll do it in our own power.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:18.540
We go prayed up in the power of the Holy Spirit of God with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:23.860
So this evening, how will we respond to the information that's been provided to us in

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.980
the Word of God with regard to the eternal things?

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.260
Father, we love you.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.900
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:40.260
We thank you that someone was willing to give us the gospel.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:48.100
Lord, I pray tonight that as we look at the truth of your Word with regard to the impending

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:54.260
judgment of these cities that were exceeding sinful, the judgment that was coming and the

00:49:54.260 --> 00:50:00.060
response of Abraham, Lord, I pray this evening that as we seek to make some application

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:07.420
in our lives, we understand that You have given us truth.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.220
The events recorded in Your Word will come to pass.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:18.620
This great white throne judgment will take place.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:25.460
Our neighbors and our co-workers, our friends and our family members are either going to

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:29.380
heaven or the lake of fire.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:37.900
And I pray, God, that You would give us a passion for souls.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.300
Help us to not be fearful.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:47.760
Help us to not have concern about what someone may think, but have a greater concern of obedience

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.540
to You.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:59.700
Help us to have that perspective that is mentioned there by the Apostle Paul.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.860
I pray that You'd work in our midst tonight, and we'll thank You for the decisions that

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.860
are made.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.860
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.860
Would You stand with me?

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.740
Kimberly is going to play quietly on the piano.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.220
Just wonder tonight...
