1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
God had revealed to him about the ministry.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,320
In fact, we said there were seven things

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,000
that Paul recognized to be true

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,039
as you begin reading through 2 Corinthians,

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,359
chapter number four.

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,920
Of course, in chapter three,

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,279
he had spoken about the glorious gospel

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,760
and the contrast between the law and grace

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,559
and what a wonderful truth it is

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,239
that we have been given this ministry.

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,239
The ministry throughout these chapters

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,440
is explained to us various aspects of the ministry.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,760
In fact, we would say this

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,119
as you come into the fifth chapter

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,279
in the next couple of weeks, we'll get there,

16
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,680
that it's the ministry of reconciliation

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,720
and what a joy to think that God has reconciled,

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,159
that we've been reconciled to God

19
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,560
through the Lord Jesus Christ

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,639
and then we have been given the opportunity

21
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,360
to participate in telling others

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,200
how they too can be reconciled.

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,880
We understand that as Paul recognized

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,439
these wonderful truths with regard to the ministry,

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,599
that it had a profound impact on him.

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,520
I would say this,

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
it should have a profound impact upon us as well,

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
that God would allow us to be used of him,

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,720
that God would allow us to serve him

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,080
and we find that the response that Paul gives

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,160
in verse number five, we preach not ourselves,

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,080
but Christ Jesus, the Lord

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,760
and we have an opportunity to be his ambassadors.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,279
We'll see that in chapter five as well,

35
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:28,360
to be his witnesses as Acts five deals with,

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,879
we are his witnesses,

37
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,760
that he has given us that opportunity.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,879
Paul was surrendered, I believe, as you study his life,

39
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,680
Paul was surrendered to the Lord.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,959
I believe that Paul was a man, an individual

41
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,680
that was obedient to God's will for his life

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,639
and Paul came to that place where he said,

43
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,959
I am crucified with Christ.

44
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,279
Not only that, he says, I die daily

45
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:56,279
and Paul understood the importance of living for the Lord

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,879
and understood that one day he would stand before the Lord

47
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,959
and give an account for what he did

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,480
and he was consumed, I believe, as you study his life,

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,479
with desiring to do what God had called him to do.

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,919
We find that as we pick up this morning

51
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,759
in chapter four, verse number eight

52
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,520
and go through the end of the chapter,

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,240
as this fourth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,240
is concluded, we find that Paul now speaks

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,520
with a measure of transparency about the ministry.

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
In fact, as we look at the Bible,

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,720
it's so exciting to see how often we find

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,520
the writers of scripture and we know all scripture

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,399
is given by inspiration of God

60
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:39,639
but we understand that God used mankind,

61
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,360
he used men to write, to pen the words

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
and it's God's words but we find that

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,720
as you look at the book of Psalms,

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,240
there's such transparency among the Psalms

65
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,440
and you find that we can relate to that

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,279
and here in chapter number four,

67
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:58,600
I believe that Paul gets extremely transparent

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,119
with regard to the ministry.

69
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:03,759
We find that twice within the text of chapter number four,

70
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,860
once in verse number one and then again in verse number 16,

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,860
this phrase is used, we faint not.

72
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,039
We faint not.

73
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,160
You think about the theme of 2024 continue

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,119
and you think about the theme for this year

75
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,399
that God's grace is sufficient

76
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,919
and we find that those two things

77
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,639
really marry together quite well,

78
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,759
that we're seeking to continue to do

79
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,960
what God has called us to do

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,320
and that his grace, his enabling is sufficient for us

81
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,919
and Paul says we faint not.

82
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,759
We faint not.

83
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,039
It's interesting that in the midst of all

84
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,220
of the transparency that Paul will deal with

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,119
in second Corinthians chapter number four,

86
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,520
that that phrase is used twice.

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,119
We'll use it for our title this morning, we faint not.

88
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,839
It is a joy to experience the grace of God in our lives.

89
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,119
In fact, I know I said this on Wednesday evening,

90
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,460
I talked with Holly about it as well

91
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,699
and how the reminder, I think that for many of us,

92
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,559
we're reminded of certain biblical truths

93
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,520
through various means, maybe it's something that we see,

94
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,440
maybe it's a number that you see on a license plate.

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,320
I know Mark and I have talked about that in the past

96
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,839
and maybe God will give you a verse of scripture

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,299
and remind you of some truth

98
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,480
or maybe you're somewhere and you hear something

99
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,559
but oftentimes, I find that we'll be singing in our house

100
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:29,059
and this truth of God's grace is sufficient

101
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,600
has been such an important thing for me in my life

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,839
and I hope for you as well because we need God's grace.

103
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,320
His grace is amazing.

104
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
We sing the song.

105
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,399
I know every time we get near the 180s

106
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,320
that Brother Don says, why can't it be 187, right?

107
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Sing Amazing Grace and it's such a wonderful song

108
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,480
and a wonderful truth.

109
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,359
God's grace is abundant

110
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:54,399
but he said that his grace is sufficient for me

111
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,480
and he said that his grace is sufficient for you.

112
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,760
I preached the very first message this year

113
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,299
that it's a promise that is explained

114
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,079
but it's a promise that must be embraced

115
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,160
and how important it is that we go through life

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,640
understanding the joy it is to experience the grace of God

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,720
as Paul fulfilled the will of God in his life,

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,000
I would say this, he had hardships.

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,839
He had hardships.

120
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,880
In fact, Job chapter 14 speaks of the man

121
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,839
that's born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

122
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,359
He had hardships but I want you to understand this morning

123
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,980
that Paul had hardships but he had God's help.

124
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm so thankful that Hebrews chapter 13

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,059
in verse number six reminds us

126
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:44,619
that we can have that confidence that God, he is our helper.

127
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm thankful for Psalm 46

128
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,299
and in fact, if you study the entirety of Psalm 46,

129
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,380
it's amazing what the Psalmist says

130
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,140
but he speaks about in verse number one

131
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,739
how God is a very present help in the time of trouble

132
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,839
and you find that as the verses continue in Psalm 46

133
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,399
in verse two and three, the catastrophic events

134
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,079
that the Psalmist references in that Psalm

135
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,160
but yet he says, my God is a very present help

136
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
in the time of trouble.

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,119
Paul dealt with hardships but Paul experienced God's help

138
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,440
and what a blessing that is

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,880
as we look at the passage of scripture,

140
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,200
look at it in verse number eight, begin reading with me.

141
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,299
The Bible says this, we are troubled on every side

142
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:28,760
yet not distressed, we are perplexed but not in despair,

143
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,760
persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.

144
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,220
Always bearing about in the body,

145
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,480
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

146
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,079
that the life also of Jesus

147
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,480
might be made manifest in our body.

148
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,519
For we which live are always delivered unto death

149
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,519
for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus

150
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,440
might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

151
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,359
So then death worketh in us but life in you,

152
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,839
we having the same spirit of faith,

153
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,040
according as it is written,

154
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
I believed and therefore have I spoken,

155
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,239
we also believe and therefore speak,

156
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:11,399
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus

157
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,959
shall raise up us also by Jesus

158
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,059
and shall present us with you.

159
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,179
For all things are for your sakes

160
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:23,079
that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving

161
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,440
of many redound to the glory of God,

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,440
for which cause we faint not.

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,480
But though our outward man perish,

164
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,519
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

165
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,720
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
worketh for us a far more exceeding

167
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,480
and eternal weight of glory.

168
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,320
While we look not at the things which are seen,

169
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,179
but the things which are not seen,

170
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,519
for the things which are seen are temporal,

171
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,399
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

172
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,600
This morning as we look at this passage of Scripture

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
and consider this thought, we faint not,

174
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,160
I want you to notice number one, the pressures.

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,380
The pressures.

176
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,079
Again, I mentioned by way of introduction

177
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,640
that the Apostle Paul is going to speak

178
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,720
with great transparency in this portion of Scripture.

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,839
In fact, in the book of 2 Corinthians,

180
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,640
he not only speaks here,

181
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,720
but he speaks again in chapter number 11

182
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
and again in chapter number 12

183
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,459
with great transparency with regard to the pressures

184
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,920
that he experienced.

185
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,820
We understand this morning that life is full of pressure

186
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,940
and here for just a few verses,

187
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,900
we have the opportunity to get a glimpse

188
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,179
into what the Apostle Paul experienced.

189
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:42,119
I would say this, that he had physical pressures.

190
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,700
He had emotional pressures.

191
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,599
I would say this, he had external pressures,

192
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,820
but he had internal pressures.

193
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,460
And begin to think about the pressures

194
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,880
that the Apostle Paul faced,

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,460
we find and we won't take the time to read it

196
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,400
in 2 Corinthians 11,

197
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
but in verses 24 through 28,

198
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,479
Paul lists out a whole lot of things that he suffered

199
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:06,700
and that he dealt with and those difficulties.

200
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,440
He ends it at the end of verse 28

201
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,659
and talks about that which came upon him daily,

202
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,859
the care of all the churches.

203
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:16,200
He says in the 12th chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians,

204
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,520
he says in verse number 14 and 15,

205
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,140
behold, the third time I am ready to come to you

206
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,679
and I will not be burdensome to you

207
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,280
for I seek not yours, but you.

208
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,320
For the children ought not to lay up for the parents,

209
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,760
but the parents for the children.

210
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,640
And here's what he says in verse 15,

211
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,460
I will very gladly spend and be spent for you,

212
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,719
though the more abundantly I love you,

213
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,479
the less I be loved.

214
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,400
He says to the churches in the region of Galatians,

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,080
Galatians chapter number four,

216
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,520
he asked this question, have I become your enemy

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,679
because I tell you the truth?

218
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,940
See, the Apostle Paul knew what pressures were.

219
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,520
He understood the pressures of ministry.

220
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,760
He experienced the pressures of ministry.

221
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,159
Paul is not speaking here about.

222
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,559
something that he read somewhere else from someone else.

223
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,439
He's speaking personally about what he experienced

224
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,159
and the joy as we look at here,

225
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,319
and I wanna make sure that it's packaged together

226
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,319
because I said by way of introduction

227
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,239
that there were hardships, but there's God's help.

228
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,559
And so we look first at the pressures

229
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,659
in which the Apostle Paul faced.

230
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:24,399
He says in verse number eight of 2 Corinthians 4,

231
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,439
notice he says this, we are troubled.

232
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,719
He says this, on every side.

233
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,639
We are troubled on every side.

234
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,439
To be troubled means to be afflicted.

235
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,599
It means to suffer persecution.

236
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,839
It means to be pressed hard upon.

237
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,679
And the Apostle Paul says that we are troubled

238
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,959
on every side.

239
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,799
Can you imagine, can you get in your mind this morning

240
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,479
a visual, if you will, of what the Apostle Paul

241
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,799
is seeking to communicate with regard

242
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,959
to the pressures of ministry

243
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,399
and understanding this thought of being troubled.

244
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,399
He says in verse number eight,

245
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,919
and we're just looking at the pressures at this point.

246
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,479
We'll look in just a moment at the counter

247
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,079
of each of these, but in verse number eight,

248
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,679
he says we are perplexed.

249
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,159
Ever been perplexed in life?

250
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,799
I mean, the idea of being perplexed

251
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,959
is to be without resources, to be in straits.

252
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,799
It carries with it this idea of not knowing

253
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,639
which way to turn.

254
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,979
Can I tell you that there are times

255
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,399
in which you might be perplexed,

256
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,199
and it's not because you don't know the leadership

257
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,719
of the Holy Spirit of God.

258
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,199
It's because you're concerned about the consequences

259
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,299
of the decision that you're going to make.

260
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,719
Let me say that again.

261
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,779
Being perplexed is not always because you don't know

262
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,359
the direction of the Holy Spirit of God.

263
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:43,539
Sometimes you're perplexed ministry-wise.

264
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,519
I'll speak as a pastor this morning.

265
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,479
You're perplexed because you know

266
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,039
that if you make the decision,

267
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,439
there's gonna be a fallout.

268
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:55,159
There's gonna be people that aren't gonna be happy.

269
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,599
You understand what I'm saying?

270
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,479
Sometimes it's not that you don't have the direction,

271
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,319
it's that you're concerned about the consequence.

272
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
We find that Paul says we're perplexed.

273
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,319
He says troubled on every side, perplexed.

274
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:12,359
He says this in verse number nine, persecuted.

275
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,459
Persecuted.

276
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,599
Literally, the idea is to put to flight.

277
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,839
The idea is to drive away.

278
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,199
Now, Paul knew something about persecution from both sides.

279
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,199
He knew what it was to be a persecutor, amen?

280
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,519
He went, he had the letters, he had the authority,

281
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,739
he had the power, and he knew what it was

282
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:37,759
to go and find any that were of that way.

283
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,319
But then he experienced greatly

284
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,079
what it was to be the persecuted.

285
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,879
Somebody's phone is ringing, amen?

286
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,919
Praise the Lord.

287
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,919
To put to flight, to drive away.

288
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,239
He says in verse number nine, notice he says persecuted,

289
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:01,959
and then he says cast down.

290
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,519
There it is again, hallelujah.

291
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,039
Put them on speakerphone.

292
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,239
Cast down.

293
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,479
It literally means to throw to the ground.

294
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,719
That's what it means, to be cast down.

295
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,999
Three times a charm, amen?

296
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,839
Praise the Lord.

297
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,119
Yeah, amen.

298
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,519
Call her out right there, amen?

299
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,319
Keep on preaching.

300
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,559
So to throw to the ground,

301
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,239
maybe you need to do that with that phone.

302
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,319
Cast down, amen?

303
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,799
But Paul says, as he's talking about the pressures,

304
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,399
he says troubled on every side.

305
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,319
He says perplexed, persecuted, cast down.

306
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,799
He's sharing his heart, he's sharing with transparency.

307
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,559
Listen, it's a false thing for someone to stand up and say,

308
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,439
there's not gonna be any pressures in life.

309
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,199
I mean, we got folks, we got people

310
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,959
that have all sorts of different backgrounds in our church

311
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,239
and all kinds of experiences, all different stages of life.

312
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,059
It'd be silly for a married couple to say to a couple

313
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:10,079
that's getting ready to get married and say,

314
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,879
there's no pressures in marriage.

315
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:16,479
No, it'd be silly to someone

316
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,719
that just recently had a newborn to say,

317
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,239
oh, there's no pressures in raising children.

318
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:25,679
There are pressures, there are difficulties.

319
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,399
And it'd be equally wrong for someone in ministry

320
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,399
to say someone else that's going into ministry,

321
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,679
oh, there are no pressures in ministry.

322
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,859
There are pressures.

323
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,479
I've been working with Fernando.

324
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,199
He announced his call to missions.

325
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
And it's changed the dynamic

326
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,919
of some of our meetings and discipleship.

327
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,559
And this week when we met for a couple of hours,

328
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,519
I shared with him, hey, listen, understand in ministry,

329
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,239
there's some difficulties.

330
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,739
He's getting ready to teach his first lesson.

331
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,579
You know what I told him?

332
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,599
I said, there's gonna be some that are gonna say

333
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,699
it's the best thing they ever heard.

334
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,059
And there's gonna be somebody else that asked you

335
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,959
what language you were speaking.

336
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,519
That's what I told him, because he speaks two languages.

337
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,039
But what was I trying to communicate to him?

338
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,699
Look, you can't please everybody.

339
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,479
I preached a message about a year and a half ago

340
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,379
on the audience of one, the audience of one.

341
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,839
Because you try to please everybody, you get crazy.

342
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,539
The pressures.

343
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,079
I read this little book a couple of Sunday,

344
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,439
actually three Sundays ago now.

345
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,679
Many of you know Don Sisk, just a simple book.

346
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,979
It's only like a half hour to read this book, if that.

347
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:37,799
It's like 85 pages, but just a small 85 pages.

348
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,039
Don Sisk was the director, he was a missionary in Japan.

349
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,319
He was a pastor for a number of years,

350
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,919
went to be a missionary in Japan,

351
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,599
and then was the director at BIMI for a number of years.

352
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,239
And so Don Sisk, I always thought it was kind of funny,

353
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,239
he wrote a book called Fourth Quarter.

354
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:55,359
And he used the parallels of the sports world,

355
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,479
if you will, in analogy.

356
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,879
So he wrote a book, Fourth Quarter,

357
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,799
how to serve God in the fourth quarter of your life.

358
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,879
It was a good book, I enjoyed reading it.

359
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,279
And then he wrote a book entitled Overtime.

360
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,919
Why did he write a book called Overtime?

361
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,159
Well, because he lived past 80, he's about 92 now,

362
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,999
and he's about 85, 86, and he wrote a book called Overtime.

363
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:18,599
And how to serve God in the overtime years.

364
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,399
It was a good book, I enjoyed reading it.

365
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,679
And I remember saying to Holly,

366
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,999
after he wrote that book Overtime,

367
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,679
I said, the only other sports analogy

368
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,519
I could think of is sudden death.

369
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,599
I can't think of another one.

370
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:32,739
And I said, sudden death must be the title of his next book.

371
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:33,839
But that'd be kind of weird,

372
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,619
because then he can't write the book,

373
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,899
because there was sudden death,

374
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,619
and we're just kind of joking about it.

375
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,739
And so here's the title of his newest book,

376
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:43,139
How to Stay in the Ministry Your Whole Life.

377
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,939
I like that better than sudden death.

378
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,919
And, but he wrote this little book,

379
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,019
and as I read this little book three weeks ago

380
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,379
on a Sunday afternoon, that book contained in it

381
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,479
some statistics about ministry.

382
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,299
Can I tell you this morning, it broke my heart

383
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,019
when I read the statistics about ministry.

384
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,419
Let me just share a few with you.

385
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,419
They say that 50%, 50% that begin pastoring

386
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,219
won't last five years.

387
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:16,299
They won't last five years, 50%.

388
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,779
Let me share this one with you.

389
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:22,779
Only 10% that start out pastoring retire as a pastor.

390
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,119
That means 90% along the way either die before retirement,

391
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,339
or they do something different.

392
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,099
That's a huge number.

393
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,139
Now, this statistic is in this book,

394
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:44,159
and I looked it up to try to validate some of these things,

395
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,139
and those two I could find easily

396
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,139
from a number of different sources.

397
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:52,739
But the one that's very concerning

398
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,619
is the number of pastors that leave the ministry

399
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,339
every month in America.

400
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:03,339
It's varied, so I'm gonna be transparent with you.

401
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,339
The lowest number that I saw was 250 pastors per month

402
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,059
leave the ministry.

403
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:15,059
The highest number I saw was 1,700 pastors per month

404
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,199
leave the ministry.

405
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,859
The consistent number that I saw was 1,500.

406
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,419
This book, How to Stay in the Ministry Your Whole Life

407
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,659
said 1,500 per month leave the ministry.

408
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,819
It's hard for us to wrap our minds around that.

409
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,019
But the reality is that we know,

410
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,819
we see some of this taking place where today

411
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,859
there are so many churches in America

412
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,619
that do not have pastors today.

413
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,259
There are churches that I know here in Virginia

414
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,379
without a pastor, and I mean,

415
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,659
it's not that they don't have,

416
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,039
there's no prospect for a pastor.

417
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,979
There's no one that they have lined up

418
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,579
to come be their pastor.

419
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,519
I talked with a friend on the phone on Wednesday,

420
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,479
and as I chatted with this ministry friend,

421
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:07,139
he shared with me that currently he's a missionary,

422
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,039
he's got a number of supporting churches

423
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,199
that don't have a pastor.

424
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,039
And he said, of the supporting churches

425
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,559
that I have without a pastor,

426
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,639
not one of them have even a prospect

427
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:20,000
of who would be their next pastor.

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,879
He shared with me accounts of men

429
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,479
that have worked diligently to try to find

430
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,919
their replacement with zero success.

431
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,559
It's a sad thing, it's a sad state

432
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,299
that we're dealing with, with our churches.

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,500
I don't believe that it's that God stopped calling.

434
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,399
I don't believe that.

435
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,299
Part of it is the fact that people

436
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,099
have stopped responding to the call.

437
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,779
But I think there's also a truth

438
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,899
of the pressures of ministry.

439
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,139
The pressures.

440
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,599
You look up some of the statistics,

441
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,019
they're wild, they blow your mind,

442
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,339
as to some of the pressures.

443
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,899
When you begin to think about.

444
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,179
about the Apostle Paul here,

445
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,579
and he's speaking again with great transparency,

446
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,059
and he says, look, there are pressures that we face.

447
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:10,899
There are pressures.

448
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,419
Listen, you're gonna face pressures in your life.

449
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,759
And what you're gonna find in your life,

450
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,899
you're never gonna make everyone happy either.

451
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,499
Amen?

452
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:22,499
You're not gonna ever make everyone happy.

453
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,819
Why do you think your pastor's gonna make everyone happy?

454
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,019
It's unreasonable, is it not?

455
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:28,859
Honestly.

456
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,299
I like this, I don't like that, I like that.

457
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,579
You know how it works.

458
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:36,419
And the reality is that Paul says there's great pressures.

459
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,559
But I want you to see number two.

460
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,739
With great pressures, there's great provision.

461
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,179
Praise the Lord.

462
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:47,739
It's not all negative, but there's a negative aspect.

463
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:50,019
I mean, there's reality, there's truth,

464
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,239
there's transparency.

465
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,659
And Paul says there's pressures,

466
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:56,959
but let me remind you that though there's great pressures,

467
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,439
there's great provision.

468
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,799
Why is it great provision?

469
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,699
Because it's God's provision.

470
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,439
And we find here that if we look

471
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:07,039
and we were to categorize it into two thoughts,

472
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,699
that the provision comes first in the form of God's grace.

473
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:14,719
The provision comes first in the form of God's grace.

474
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,559
And we're reminded of 2 Corinthians 12

475
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,279
and verse number nine that God's grace is sufficient.

476
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,159
That God's grace is sufficient.

477
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,279
And we find that in the text of Scripture,

478
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,359
we only looked at the pressures,

479
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,339
but notice in verse number eight,

480
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,979
as we go back and look at both sides of this,

481
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,959
that Paul says we are troubled on every side.

482
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,919
Then notice he says, yet not distressed.

483
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,059
I mean, we're troubled on every side,

484
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,079
but we're not distressed.

485
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,439
You know what it means not to be distressed?

486
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,119
It means to not be discouraged.

487
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,679
To not be discouraged.

488
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:49,899
Do you know that discouragement,

489
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,419
I shared this several weeks ago in another message,

490
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,159
but discouragement is one of the tools

491
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,599
that Satan uses most often.

492
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,719
It's a tool in the toolbox of Satan

493
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:02,119
that he loves to use to discourage people.

494
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,119
I know people right now that I could call on the phone

495
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,519
that were pastors when I started pastoring,

496
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,039
pastors that started after I started pastoring,

497
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,599
that are no longer pastors today.

498
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,279
You know what a lot of them say?

499
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,319
They're discouraged.

500
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,479
They're discouraged.

501
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:22,099
But Paul says, don't forget God's provision.

502
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:27,219
Yes, there are pressures, but oh, there's provision.

503
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:29,259
Yes, we're troubled on every side,

504
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:32,039
but we're not distressed, we're not discouraged.

505
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,879
Why?

506
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:34,739
Well, we'll get to the why at the end of the text

507
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,679
because he's got an eternal focus, not a temporal focus.

508
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:41,779
He's got a focus of pleasing God, not pleasing man.

509
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:44,099
And we find that he says we're not distressed.

510
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,939
He says, number two, in verse number eight,

511
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:48,659
when he mentions about we are perplexed,

512
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,499
but not in despair.

513
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,499
To not be, he says, we're not without hope.

514
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,339
He says this, we're not depressed.

515
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,699
You hear that word often used about depression.

516
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:03,479
I read a bunch of statistics this week.

517
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,779
I can't remember exactly the number, so don't quote me,

518
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,519
but it was about 45%, if I remember correctly,

519
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,619
of pastors that were surveyed that reported

520
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,219
they were depressed.

521
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,299
Let me ask you this, if the pastor's depressed,

522
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,939
how's he gonna lead the ministry?

523
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:23,459
If you're depressed, how are you leading your home?

524
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:26,139
You know what I'm saying?

525
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,499
It's a great number.

526
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:31,739
But Paul says God's provision, his grace.

527
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:35,459
Oh yeah, I'm perplexed, but I'm not in despair.

528
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,099
I'm not without hope.

529
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,499
I'm not depressed.

530
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:41,459
He says this in verse number nine, persecuted.

531
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,539
Oh yeah, we're persecuted, but not forsaken.

532
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,979
It means not to be abandoned.

533
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:48,059
It means not to be deserted.

534
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,099
It means not to be deserted.

535
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,939
Oh, I'm so reminded of the truth,

536
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:53,579
and I used it by way of introduction,

537
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,219
that there's hardships, but there's help.

538
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:58,259
And our God, it says in Hebrews 13, verse five and six,

539
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,099
at the end of verse five,

540
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,459
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee,

541
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:04,399
so that we might boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

542
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:08,339
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

543
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,099
Listen, I'm not abandoned.

544
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,339
I'm not deserted.

545
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,799
There are times, loneliness, it's on the top list

546
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,159
of those that are talking, these pastors

547
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,859
that were interviewed and surveyed.

548
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:19,979
Oh, they feel loneliness, they feel,

549
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,199
no, no, the Holy Spirit's with us.

550
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,939
The Holy Spirit's with us, and as we look here,

551
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:30,859
and we see God's provision, we rejoice

552
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,659
in knowing that in the pressures,

553
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:36,339
there's also the provision, and this is true in your life

554
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,179
just as much as it's true in my life.

555
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,859
This is true in the lives of the believers

556
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,019
in the church in Corinth as much as it was

557
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,099
in the life of the apostle Paul.

558
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,259
And he says in verse number nine,

559
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,799
we're cast down, but not destroyed.

560
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,299
Cast down, but not destroyed, the idea, obviously,

561
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,219
to be killed or to be rendered useless.

562
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:04,579
I think Paul had a fear of becoming a castaway.

563
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,579
Mentioned in 1 Corinthians chapter nine.

564
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,819
Paul understood God had a purpose for his life,

565
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,699
and God understood he faced great pressures.

566
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:15,899
Again, the pressures that he faced,

567
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,099
there were physical pressures,

568
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,379
there were emotional pressures,

569
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,139
there were external pressures,

570
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:22,179
there were internal pressures.

571
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,619
And I think as you look at 1 Corinthians chapter number 11,

572
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,219
excuse me, chapter number, yeah, 11, verses 24 through 28,

573
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,299
I think it was the internal pressures

574
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,059
that affected Paul more than the external pressures.

575
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:41,579
I think it was the internal pressures.

576
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:43,339
I think about your own family, your own life.

577
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,179
When you got pressures internally in your home,

578
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,379
it's a lot harder to deal with

579
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,379
than when a neighbor's got a problem with you.

580
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:51,219
Am I right?

581
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,659
I think it was the internal that affected him the most.

582
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,139
But you know what Paul says?

583
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,979
Oh, there's all these pressures,

584
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:02,739
but there's God's provision, there's God's grace,

585
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,779
and God's grace is sufficient.

586
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:09,179
We continue reading, and we begin to see in verses 10,

587
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,699
down through verse number 15,

588
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,419
how Paul will continue to kind of expound

589
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:15,499
on what he's listed in verses eight and nine.

590
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,939
He says, always bearing about in the body

591
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:20,099
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

592
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:21,659
that the life also of Jesus

593
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,619
might be made manifest in our body.

594
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:24,459
Think about Paul.

595
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,659
I mentioned by way of introduction,

596
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,219
he says, I'm crucified with Christ.

597
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,739
He says, I die daily.

598
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,299
It's that constant reminder.

599
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,819
I said to Fernando on Thursday when we met,

600
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:34,819
I said, Fernando, you need to learn to be dead

601
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:37,899
to compliment and to criticism.

602
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,739
And he could tell you,

603
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:42,779
I'll tell you transparently right here.

604
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,339
Here's what I told him on Thursday.

605
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,939
For me personally, it's easy to be dead to compliment.

606
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,979
It's hard to be dead to criticism.

607
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,619
That's just me personally.

608
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,739
Some people are completely opposite.

609
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,059
They couldn't care less what you said about them.

610
00:26:57,939 --> 00:26:58,779
They're dead to criticism.

611
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,259
It doesn't affect them one bit.

612
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:02,059
They don't give two thoughts about it.

613
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,219
But you start complimenting them,

614
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,379
and man, their head gets big,

615
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,179
and they get all kinds of puffed up.

616
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,499
We're all different.

617
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:10,459
Here's what I told Fernando.

618
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:11,459
You gotta know you.

619
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:13,619
You gotta know you.

620
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,499
What affects you?

621
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:18,259
How does it impact you?

622
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:21,619
But we need to remember that we're dead with Christ.

623
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:22,779
We're dead with Christ.

624
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,579
Notice verse 11.

625
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,939
For we which live are always delivered

626
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,859
unto death for Jesus' sake.

627
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,339
The life also of Jesus might be made manifest

628
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:35,339
in our mortal flesh.

629
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,299
So then death worketh in us,

630
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,539
but life in you.

631
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:43,219
We, having the same spirit of faith,

632
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:44,539
according as it is written,

633
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,499
I believed and therefore have I spoken.

634
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,979
We also believe and therefore speak.

635
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:54,299
He quotes back to the psalmist in Psalm 116.

636
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,739
And I'm so thankful that we've been given truth,

637
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,819
and then we speak the truth.

638
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,459
We have been, listen, in 1 John,

639
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,499
you read 1 John, chapter number one,

640
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,819
John starts out talking about we're his witnesses.

641
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:07,299
We're eyewitnesses of this.

642
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,619
And we speak what we have received

643
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,499
and what a blessing it is to know

644
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:12,739
that God would use us.

645
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,419
And we come to verse number 15.

646
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,099
I'll get to verse 14 here in just a moment.

647
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,699
But I want you to see verse number 15.

648
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,379
For all things are for your sakes

649
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,419
that the abundant grace

650
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:25,859
might through the thanksgiving of many

651
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,499
redound to the glory of God.

652
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,699
Now I want you to think about verse 15.

653
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:33,019
He speaks about all things are for your sakes.

654
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,699
Paul was a man that was surrendered.

655
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,299
He was yielded.

656
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,659
He understood for me to live as Christ

657
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:38,979
and to die as gain.

658
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,659
Paul says to the church in Philippi,

659
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:42,379
even after he makes that statement,

660
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:44,379
he says that it's more needful for you

661
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:45,339
that I'm here, why?

662
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:47,699
Because he understood that God was using him

663
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:49,379
to help them.

664
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:50,259
He understood that.

665
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,499
He understood the principle.

666
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:55,419
He understood the way that God designed it to work.

667
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,179
And he says all things are for your sakes.

668
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,659
And then he makes this statement

669
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:00,899
that the abundant grace,

670
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:03,419
think about that just for a moment.

671
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,219
We sing about God's amazing grace,

672
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:06,979
but we read and we talk about

673
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:07,859
as we get in the scriptures

674
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,579
about God's abundant grace.

675
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,619
Paul makes note in 1 Timothy

676
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,659
about how God's grace is abundant

677
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:14,899
and it was toward him

678
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,499
and how he trusted Christ as a savior

679
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,739
and he rejoices in the grace of God.

680
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,179
We can begin to think about the grace,

681
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,019
speaking of which,

682
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:25,819
we talk about the enabling grace,

683
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,339
the grace to serve God.

684
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:29,259
He gives us that grace.

685
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:30,219
It's abundant.

686
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,579
But notice what he says.

687
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:35,899
Might through the thanksgiving of many.

688
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,059
Now Paul's there just for a moment.

689
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,019
How thankful are we for God's grace?

690
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,459
But then we can ask ourselves this question.

691
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:45,339
How thankful are we in general?

692
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,619
How thankful are we in general?

693
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:52,419
We know the verses in everything give thanks

694
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:55,139
for this is the will of God

695
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:57,059
and Christ Jesus concerning you.

696
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:00,939
It says that through the thanksgiving of many,

697
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:07,759
down to the glory of God. You know when we give thanks, it pleases God. I'm being honest

698
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:15,219
with you this morning. When we give thanks, it brings glory to God, it pleases God when

699
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:24,079
we thank Him. You know what's so easy? To complain. To complain. Complain about everything.

700
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,739
I mean honestly, if we examine our lives, we complain about so many things. It's too

701
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:36,899
hot, it's too cold. I like this, I don't like that. This was, it was too loud, it was

702
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:42,579
too soft, it was too this, it was too that. You understand what I'm saying? You know what

703
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:49,099
the Bible says about complaining? The Old Testament word is murmur. I actually like

704
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:55,459
the word murmur more than I like complain. Because murmur just sounds bad. It does. You're

705
00:30:55,459 --> 00:31:01,059
murmuring. Just carry something with it that just, that's probably not a good thing. Even

706
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,659
if you don't know the definition of the word and somebody says, stop murmuring. You're

707
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:10,339
like, hmm, that's probably, something's not right there. God heard their complaints and

708
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:17,499
it says this, He was not pleased. He was not pleased. You read the book of Numbers. God

709
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:24,699
was serious. There's some consequences. God miraculously provided manna. What do the people

710
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:34,819
say? I don't like this stuff. My soul loatheth. Come on. Am I telling you the truth this morning?

711
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:44,539
Come on. It was God's provision. I don't like it. Oh, that we were back in Egypt. Really?

712
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:51,179
Do you remember what Egypt was like? But is that not what they say? Sometimes we need

713
00:31:51,179 --> 00:32:02,379
a reset. We need a reset. He says in verse number 15 that it would read down to the

714
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:11,459
glory of God. Just be thankful. Can I use a simple illustration this morning? I'm going

715
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:16,379
to say always, but I'm sure there are some times that I forget. I'm going to come down

716
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:20,539
for a minute, Fernando. Fernando's learned how to do the sound. I think it's great. He's

717
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:26,419
going to need that one day. Seriously. I know enough about that stuff to get everything

718
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:38,859
in trouble. I purpose every day to thank Holly for the meals that she makes. But can I tell

719
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:46,299
you something, Ron? They're not always my favorite meal. Listen for a minute. It's not

720
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:52,819
always my favorite meal, but I always thank her for the meal. You want to know one of

721
00:32:52,819 --> 00:33:02,139
the things we had last night for dinner? Brussels sprouts. That's just a bad word, man. Brussels

722
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:07,139
sprouts. I do not like Brussels sprouts. In fact, there was a piece of a Brussels sprout

723
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:14,979
that got on my broccoli. It was contaminated. Amen? But you know what I did after dinner?

724
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:22,019
I thanked her for dinner. She labored for that. She worked hard for that. And I appreciate

725
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,939
it. But you know what I could do? I could complain about it. We're having this again.

726
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,539
Don't you know I don't like that? Now, that wouldn't work out real good for her along.

727
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:38,779
Am I right? But what do we do in church? Help me this morning. Help me this morning. What

728
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:47,859
do we do in church? Right? And I thank her because I appreciate it. I'm not saying that

729
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:54,379
because I want anyone to thank me. I already told you, a compliment doesn't bother me.

730
00:33:54,379 --> 00:34:02,619
What I'm saying to you this morning is that sometimes we need a reset. We need a reset.

731
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:09,259
Paul talks about the pressures, but he talks about the provision. I preached a message

732
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:16,979
years ago on a Sunday morning from the book of Habakkuk. Somebody left here saying, I

733
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:24,539
can't believe he would preach up from Habakkuk on Sunday morning. Yeah. Yeah. And there was

734
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:29,739
a visitor here that morning, husband and wife, and they sent me an email and said, we've

735
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:36,539
been doing our devotions to the book of Habakkuk and that helped us so much. What I'm saying

736
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:44,819
to you this morning is that the pressures are real, but God's provision is real. We

737
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,539
see not only God's grace, but we see God's power. Notice with me if we're looking at

738
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,659
the provision and we note it from two aspects. Number one, the grace of God. Number two,

739
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,579
the power of God. We see in verse number 16, he says this, for which cause we faint

740
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:06,619
not. Paul, how is it that you can go through and experience all these pressures of life?

741
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:14,619
How can you have these pressures of ministry? How can you not be like John Mark and go back?

742
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:22,379
Because God's grace and because of God's power. He says, for which cause we faint not, but

743
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:27,739
though our outward man perish, can you imagine as we looked at verses 8 and 9 and all that

744
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:34,739
he explained, the outward man would perish, but he says this, yet the inward man is renewed

745
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:42,459
day by day. Brother Mark's Sunday school class this morning about the Holy Spirit, the work

746
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:47,579
of the Holy Spirit. And he went to Ephesians 3 and verse 16. I got it written in my notes

747
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,219
to go there. Because Paul, as he's praying for the believers in Ephesus, you know how

748
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:59,219
he prays for them that they be renewed with strength by the Spirit in their inner man.

749
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,819
And oh, we thank God for his power. We understand that the outward man might perish, but the

750
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:11,819
inward man is renewed day by day. How is it renewed day by day? Oh, if you're not in God's

751
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:18,619
Word, you have no idea how that happens. I'll be honest with you. If you're not doing devotions

752
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:25,619
regularly, if you're not in the Word of God, you're not having your inner man strengthened.

753
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:32,539
There's no, here's what I've learned in the Christian life, there's no just status quo.

754
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:39,139
There's no just staying in an idle position. You're either going forward or you're going

755
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:44,859
backwards. Honestly. You're either going forward or you're going backwards. And how is that

756
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:51,979
inward man renewed? It's renewed, notice what he says, day by day. Can I tell you this morning,

757
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,619
if you wait until the point that you're ready to faint, I can't do this anymore, and then

758
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:05,619
you're like, I need to be strengthened. Oh, God is able, but you're kind of late. You

759
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:13,539
need to be renewed day by day by day by day. And you go to it again and again and again.

760
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:17,299
Brother Jeff and I were talking when we're stapling and we're talking about some things

761
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,859
that we've just recently seen in God's Word as we've been doing our devotions and reading

762
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:26,779
and studying and it's like, man, there's things that God will point out. I've been preaching,

763
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:33,119
I've preached like 2,000 messages. I've preached through entirely like 25 books of the Bible

764
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,899
since I've been the pastor here, verse by verse, and yet every day, I don't, listen,

765
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:44,059
I don't go to the Bible just to find a sermon. I read this book every day of my life because

766
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:50,059
I need it. And the reality is that God will show me things, I'm like, man, that's really

767
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:56,339
good. Oh, God, I needed that today. Thank you for encouraging me with that truth. And

768
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:01,939
then maybe I'll have an interaction at some point later that day or that week and God

769
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:06,979
has prepared me for that interaction that I would have with a truth from God's Word

770
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:13,499
that can be shared with someone else. And he says the inward man is renewed day by day.

771
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,659
This morning, the pressures, the provision, but I want you to notice finally this morning

772
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:24,659
the perspective. The perspective. We know in verse number 14 that Paul had great confidence.

773
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:31,699
Notice how he begins verse number 14, knowing. Knowing. He doesn't say that he's thinking

774
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:36,539
that this might be the case. No, he says knowing. Listen, there's some things that God wants

775
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:43,539
you to know. We sang the song this morning to start when we all get to heaven, right?

776
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,859
Or was it The Roll is Caught Up Yonder? Which one did we sing? The Roll is Caught Up Yonder.

777
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:52,619
The Roll is Caught Up Yonder. Mr. Black, I think, is the one that wrote that song. And

778
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,619
he says this, when the roll is caught up yonder, I might be there. That's not what he said.

779
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:06,939
He said I will be there. Confidence. Confidence. Notice what Paul mentions that he knows in

780
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:15,059
verse number 14. Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus. Hey, by the way, we serve

781
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:21,099
a risen Savior, don't we? Oh, we serve a risen Savior. He's alive. He rules. He reigns. He's

782
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:27,419
coming back one day. Hallelujah. And he says knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus

783
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:34,419
shall. Certainty. Certainty. Shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with

784
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,859
you. Man, it's a beautiful picture that God gives us in one verse of scripture. And we

785
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:48,979
know, listen, this truth is that death has no power over us. If we've been saved by the

786
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:55,019
grace of God, we will, listen, Christ is the first fruits, 1 Corinthians 15, we will rise

787
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,939
again. And what a joy that is. And he says that he'll present us. I want you to think

788
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,819
just for a moment.

789
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:02,459
of the truth of the church.

790
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:05,119
The individual believers make up the church,

791
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,379
but the church is known as the body of Christ,

792
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,139
but also the bride of Christ.

793
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,179
And who's gonna do, who's gonna present us?

794
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,059
You read Ephesians chapter number five,

795
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,859
and you begin reading about the church

796
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:18,859
and the relationship between the husbands and wives.

797
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:21,139
And then you find that the Bible talks about

798
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:22,739
how husbands are to love their wives,

799
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:26,659
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it

800
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,099
in Ephesians chapter number five.

801
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,799
And he goes on to say this,

802
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:34,259
that he, Christ, might sanctify and cleanse it, the church,

803
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,459
with the washing of water by the blood

804
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:41,059
that he might present it to himself, a glorious church,

805
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:43,639
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,

806
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,099
but that it should be holy and without blemish.

807
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,219
Oh, what a day it's gonna be when we get to heaven.

808
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,299
I'm serious.

809
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,619
Heaven's gonna be a wonderful place.

810
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,179
Not everybody in heaven's gonna be thinking

811
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,679
the same way you think either.

812
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,699
I know we're gonna be glorified,

813
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:03,419
but there's some things that God's gonna straighten out,

814
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,259
I think.

815
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:09,179
But he says he's gonna present us.

816
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,899
Think about that this morning.

817
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,139
Paul said knowing, but then I want you to see

818
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:18,059
the focus of Paul, his perspective.

819
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,939
We're gonna read verse 18 and then go back to verse 17

820
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,259
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four.

821
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:25,259
Verse 18 says, while we look not at the things

822
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:27,819
which are seen, but of things which are not seen.

823
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,659
That's the focus of Paul.

824
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:32,499
Where's my focus, where's your focus?

825
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,179
Can I tell you this morning it's really easy

826
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:35,939
to look at the things that are seen?

827
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:39,139
It requires discipline to look at the things

828
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:40,059
that are not seen.

829
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:42,939
Requires discipline.

830
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:45,259
To have an eternal focus.

831
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:46,619
Oh, you gotta work on it.

832
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,779
Why, because the things which are seen,

833
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:50,859
those are things right in front of you.

834
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,939
Those things, those are the pressures.

835
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:55,099
Those are the difficulties, those are the distress,

836
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,139
that's what that is.

837
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,899
And Paul says, while we look not at the things

838
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:02,259
which are seen, but of the things which are not seen,

839
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:06,899
notice he says this, for the things which are seen

840
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:11,899
are temporal, but the things which are not seen

841
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,819
are eternal.

842
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:16,659
Oh, that God would help us to have an eternal focus.

843
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,659
An eternal focus.

844
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:22,979
Sometimes we get sideways about things here on Earth.

845
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:24,739
How many of you ever had a disagreement with your wife?

846
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,579
Don't raise your hand.

847
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,819
How many of you ever had a disagreement with your wife?

848
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:31,059
And afterwards, never?

849
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:34,899
He's coming to the altar this morning, amen?

850
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:36,499
He'd be the first one here before Kimberly

851
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:38,819
hits the first note, amen?

852
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:39,819
But here, listen.

853
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,579
Sometimes we have a disagreement with our wife

854
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,579
and it's over something so insignificant.

855
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,819
We're sideways with each other, problems.

856
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:55,219
And you sit down and say, what actually happened?

857
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:57,779
And you start figuring out and you're like,

858
00:42:57,779 --> 00:43:00,099
that's kind of, shouldn't use these words,

859
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:03,739
but stupid, dumb, silly, whatever word you want to use.

860
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:06,259
Why?

861
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:09,419
See, sometimes we're just so temporally focused.

862
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:13,819
God says we need to get an eternal focus.

863
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:15,339
We look not at the things which are seen,

864
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:16,779
but the things which are not seen.

865
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:18,779
And we have to ask ourselves this morning,

866
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:19,899
where's our focus?

867
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:23,179
See, his perspective, the perspective of Paul

868
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:27,619
impacted how he responded to the pressures of life.

869
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,299
Can I tell you this morning that your perspective

870
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:33,099
is going to impact how you respond to the pressures?

871
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:35,459
You're gonna have pressures, I guarantee you.

872
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:39,739
And your perspective is going to impact

873
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:43,299
how you respond to those pressures.

874
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:46,139
And we find that here in verse number 17,

875
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:49,099
we see really the response of Paul

876
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:52,339
and it's all impacted because of the proper perspective

877
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,139
that he had and the Bible says,

878
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:58,299
notice what Paul says, for our light affliction.

879
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:01,499
Now, if you've ever read anything about the Apostle Paul

880
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:03,579
and you've ever read anything about the things

881
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:06,339
that he suffered, the pressures that he endured,

882
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,739
you would scratch your head on trying to figure out

883
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:11,379
why it would be termed light affliction.

884
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:15,499
He stoned and left for dead.

885
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,219
I believe God raised him up.

886
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:20,019
Listen, I mean, you begin to think about

887
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:23,579
all that Paul suffered and he says,

888
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,499
our light affliction, but then notice

889
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,499
it goes a moment further, he says,

890
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,299
or it goes a page further, he says,

891
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:34,659
which is but for a moment.

892
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:38,099
Now, when in Paul's ministry did he not suffer hardship?

893
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,539
You're gonna have a hard time reading in the Gospel

894
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:44,739
or in the book of Acts, reading through the epistles,

895
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:46,739
you're gonna have a hard time finding a time

896
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:50,779
in Paul's ministry where he wasn't facing pressures.

897
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:52,259
He says, but for a moment.

898
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:54,739
Why does he say it's for a moment?

899
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,859
Paul, it's your whole Christian life.

900
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:01,619
From the time you got saved to the time you were beheaded,

901
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,379
I mean, for all of it, you face pressures,

902
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:05,939
but it's just a moment, why?

903
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:08,259
Because I'm looking to eternity

904
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:11,539
and I'm gonna be with my Savior forever.

905
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:14,059
And it's just a moment, it's just light affliction.

906
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:16,939
By the way, what did our Savior suffer for us?

907
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:19,659
What did he suffer for us?

908
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,499
For the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross.

909
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:28,379
This word affliction in verse number 17

910
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:31,339
of our text of Scripture, the word troubled

911
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:33,779
in verse number eight is the root word

912
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,459
for that word affliction.

913
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,579
We're troubled on every side,

914
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:38,699
we're dealing with these afflictions.

915
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:40,259
This morning again in Sunday school,

916
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:42,579
Mark went over to Psalm 119, the psalmist says,

917
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,619
it was good for me to be afflicted.

918
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:46,459
Now, most of us would never say that.

919
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:50,219
Why, we don't like being afflicted.

920
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:52,259
Are we honest this morning?

921
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:54,019
You don't like affliction?

922
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,419
But the psalmist says it was good for me to be afflicted,

923
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:59,859
why, because then I learned thy statutes.

924
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:02,179
There's some things that we learn about God.

925
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,019
There's some things that we learn about God's grace

926
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,699
and about God's power, about God's purpose

927
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,099
through the times of affliction,

928
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,739
through the times of difficulty.

929
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,939
And Paul says, it's just light affliction,

930
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,059
it's just for a moment.

931
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,739
Then notice what he says, because he understands

932
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:21,419
that God is working to accomplish something great.

933
00:46:21,419 --> 00:46:23,059
He's working to accomplish something

934
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,019
that would bring glory to his name.

935
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,619
Notice in verse number 17, he says,

936
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,939
for our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

937
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:34,659
worketh for us a far more exceeding

938
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:38,099
and eternal weight of glory.

939
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:44,099
Paul, beaten, stoned, shipwrecked.

940
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,099
Oh, God's working.

941
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,459
He's working something good.

942
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:49,699
He's working something great.

943
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:51,579
He's working something for his glory.

944
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:54,619
He's helping me to be conformed to his image.

945
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:58,539
It's wonderful, but it's all based on perspective.

946
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:01,179
Sometimes we get the wrong perspective in life.

947
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:04,379
Seriously, we just got a temporal focus.

948
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:07,459
We're just looking at things that don't really matter

949
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:09,539
in the big scheme of things.

950
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:12,499
There are eight billion people on this earth.

951
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,939
It's estimated that somewhere around six billion of them

952
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:17,939
are going to go to hell, the lake of fire.

953
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:21,259
Yeah?

954
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:22,459
I think that's low.

955
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,499
I think it's low.

956
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:26,779
I think it's more than that.

957
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,659
Multiple billions of people have never heard

958
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:32,099
the name of Jesus Christ.

959
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,099
And we want a church in Corinth.

960
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,219
I'm of Paul.

961
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:42,259
I'm of Cephas.

962
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,779
I'm of, have these divisions and these, seriously?

963
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:48,979
Seriously?

964
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:53,259
Paul says we got to get our perspective on heaven.

965
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:55,579
We got to get our perspective on eternity.

966
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,259
Every individual in Corinth,

967
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:59,819
every individual here this morning,

968
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:01,659
we're going to experience hardships.

969
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:03,619
We're going to experience hardships.

970
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:07,459
We're going to experience the pressures in life.

971
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:10,099
But through the hardships, the Lord is our helper.

972
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:13,619
His provision, His grace, and His power is enough.

973
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,259
It's enough.

974
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,899
We find, it's wonderful.

975
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:19,899
I turn over here to the book of 1 Peter,

976
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:21,459
in chapter number five.

977
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,859
In verse number eight, I'll read verse seven with it.

978
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:29,059
I wasn't planning to go here,

979
00:48:29,379 --> 00:48:31,739
but it says, casting all your care upon Him,

980
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:33,859
for He careth for you.

981
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:36,419
And then it tells us in verse eight, be sober, be vigilant,

982
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:38,219
because your adversary, the devil, is a roaring lion,

983
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,419
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

984
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:41,539
And then verse nine says,

985
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:44,739
whom resist steadfast in the faith,

986
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:49,339
knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished

987
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:51,259
in your brethren that are in the world,

988
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,939
but the God of all grace,

989
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:58,579
who hath called us unto eternal glory by Christ Jesus,

990
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:01,939
after that ye have suffered a while.

991
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,779
I don't know how long a while is, and neither do you.

992
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,859
You can look in any language you want to look in.

993
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,059
It is an unspecified period of time.

994
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:10,379
You can be the greatest Greek scholar

995
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,219
there's ever been to walk upon the face of the earth,

996
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:15,019
and a little while means a little while.

997
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,619
It's unspecified.

998
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:17,459
I don't know how long it is,

999
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:18,659
but you know what I do know?

1000
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,459
God does.

1001
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:23,259
God does, and I also know this, it's not forever.

1002
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:25,779
It's not forever.

1003
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:29,099
And he says this, make you perfect,

1004
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:34,099
establish, strengthen, settle you to him,

1005
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:39,819
be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

1006
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:42,939
Listen, we need to allow the truth of God's word

1007
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:48,059
to benefit our lives.

1008
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:52,819
Allow his plan to change our perspective,

1009
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:56,379
because the pressures are gonna come.

1010
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,339
The provision will be there.

1011
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:00,179
God will give it.

1012
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:07,619
But your perspective and my perspective play a huge role in this thing. Play a huge role

1013
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:12,939
in this thing this morning. Oh, that we'd get our eyes on glory, get our eyes on heaven,

1014
00:50:12,939 --> 00:50:17,419
on eternity. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your

1015
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:24,959
word, the truth contained therein. God, I pray this morning that you would help us.

1016
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:31,979
I don't know all of the pressures that your people are facing today. I don't know of the

1017
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:39,779
pressures that have mounted, maybe that have caused some to be discouraged and depressed.

1018
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:44,339
They've not experienced your provision. God, today would you help them to experience the

1019
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:49,819
provision that you've given to them, your grace and your power. If we faint in the day

1020
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:56,459
of adversity, our strength is small. It's not talking of physical, it's spiritual. God,

1021
00:50:56,459 --> 00:51:04,299
help us to be strengthened in the inner man day by day. Help us to have this proper perspective

1022
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:16,859
of eternity. Oh, God, help us to not focus on the temporal things, but to focus on the

1023
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:22,499
eternal things. Would you use us for your honor and for your glory? Would you move and work? Holy

1024
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:28,219
Spirit, have your will and your way. Well, thank you for every decision that's made. For it's in

1025
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:32,619
Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's

1026
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:35,499
going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
