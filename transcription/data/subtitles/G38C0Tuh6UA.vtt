WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
God had revealed to him about the ministry.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.320
In fact, we said there were seven things

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.000
that Paul recognized to be true

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.039
as you begin reading through 2 Corinthians,

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.359
chapter number four.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.920
Of course, in chapter three,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.279
he had spoken about the glorious gospel

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.760
and the contrast between the law and grace

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.559
and what a wonderful truth it is

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.239
that we have been given this ministry.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
The ministry throughout these chapters

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.440
is explained to us various aspects of the ministry.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.760
In fact, we would say this

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.119
as you come into the fifth chapter

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.279
in the next couple of weeks, we'll get there,

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:37.680
that it's the ministry of reconciliation

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.720
and what a joy to think that God has reconciled,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.159
that we've been reconciled to God

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.560
through the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.639
and then we have been given the opportunity

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:50.360
to participate in telling others

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.200
how they too can be reconciled.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.880
We understand that as Paul recognized

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.439
these wonderful truths with regard to the ministry,

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.599
that it had a profound impact on him.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.520
I would say this,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.040
it should have a profound impact upon us as well,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
that God would allow us to be used of him,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.720
that God would allow us to serve him

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.080
and we find that the response that Paul gives

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.160
in verse number five, we preach not ourselves,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.080
but Christ Jesus, the Lord

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.760
and we have an opportunity to be his ambassadors.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.279
We'll see that in chapter five as well,

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.360
to be his witnesses as Acts five deals with,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.879
we are his witnesses,

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.760
that he has given us that opportunity.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.879
Paul was surrendered, I believe, as you study his life,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.680
Paul was surrendered to the Lord.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.959
I believe that Paul was a man, an individual

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.680
that was obedient to God's will for his life

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.639
and Paul came to that place where he said,

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.959
I am crucified with Christ.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.279
Not only that, he says, I die daily

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:56.279
and Paul understood the importance of living for the Lord

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.879
and understood that one day he would stand before the Lord

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.959
and give an account for what he did

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.480
and he was consumed, I believe, as you study his life,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.479
with desiring to do what God had called him to do.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.919
We find that as we pick up this morning

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.759
in chapter four, verse number eight

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.520
and go through the end of the chapter,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.240
as this fourth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240
is concluded, we find that Paul now speaks

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.520
with a measure of transparency about the ministry.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.080
In fact, as we look at the Bible,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.720
it's so exciting to see how often we find

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.520
the writers of scripture and we know all scripture

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.399
is given by inspiration of God

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.639
but we understand that God used mankind,

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.360
he used men to write, to pen the words

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.080
and it's God's words but we find that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.720
as you look at the book of Psalms,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.240
there's such transparency among the Psalms

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.440
and you find that we can relate to that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.279
and here in chapter number four,

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.600
I believe that Paul gets extremely transparent

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.119
with regard to the ministry.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.759
We find that twice within the text of chapter number four,

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:07.860
once in verse number one and then again in verse number 16,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.860
this phrase is used, we faint not.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.039
We faint not.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.160
You think about the theme of 2024 continue

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.119
and you think about the theme for this year

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.399
that God's grace is sufficient

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.919
and we find that those two things

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.639
really marry together quite well,

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.759
that we're seeking to continue to do

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.960
what God has called us to do

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.320
and that his grace, his enabling is sufficient for us

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.919
and Paul says we faint not.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.759
We faint not.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.039
It's interesting that in the midst of all

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.220
of the transparency that Paul will deal with

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.119
in second Corinthians chapter number four,

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.520
that that phrase is used twice.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.119
We'll use it for our title this morning, we faint not.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.839
It is a joy to experience the grace of God in our lives.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.119
In fact, I know I said this on Wednesday evening,

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.460
I talked with Holly about it as well

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.699
and how the reminder, I think that for many of us,

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.559
we're reminded of certain biblical truths

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.520
through various means, maybe it's something that we see,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.440
maybe it's a number that you see on a license plate.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.320
I know Mark and I have talked about that in the past

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.839
and maybe God will give you a verse of scripture

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.299
and remind you of some truth

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.480
or maybe you're somewhere and you hear something

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.559
but oftentimes, I find that we'll be singing in our house

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.059
and this truth of God's grace is sufficient

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.600
has been such an important thing for me in my life

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.839
and I hope for you as well because we need God's grace.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.320
His grace is amazing.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.320
We sing the song.

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:41.399
I know every time we get near the 180s

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.320
that Brother Don says, why can't it be 187, right?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.320
Sing Amazing Grace and it's such a wonderful song

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.480
and a wonderful truth.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.359
God's grace is abundant

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:54.399
but he said that his grace is sufficient for me

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.480
and he said that his grace is sufficient for you.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.760
I preached the very first message this year

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.299
that it's a promise that is explained

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:04.079
but it's a promise that must be embraced

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.160
and how important it is that we go through life

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.640
understanding the joy it is to experience the grace of God

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.720
as Paul fulfilled the will of God in his life,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.000
I would say this, he had hardships.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.839
He had hardships.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.880
In fact, Job chapter 14 speaks of the man

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.839
that's born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.359
He had hardships but I want you to understand this morning

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:35.980
that Paul had hardships but he had God's help.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.100
I'm so thankful that Hebrews chapter 13

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.059
in verse number six reminds us

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:44.619
that we can have that confidence that God, he is our helper.

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:46.500
I'm thankful for Psalm 46

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.299
and in fact, if you study the entirety of Psalm 46,

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:51.380
it's amazing what the Psalmist says

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.140
but he speaks about in verse number one

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.739
how God is a very present help in the time of trouble

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:00.839
and you find that as the verses continue in Psalm 46

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.399
in verse two and three, the catastrophic events

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.079
that the Psalmist references in that Psalm

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.160
but yet he says, my God is a very present help

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.720
in the time of trouble.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.119
Paul dealt with hardships but Paul experienced God's help

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.440
and what a blessing that is

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880
as we look at the passage of scripture,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.200
look at it in verse number eight, begin reading with me.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.299
The Bible says this, we are troubled on every side

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:28.760
yet not distressed, we are perplexed but not in despair,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760
persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.220
Always bearing about in the body,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.480
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.079
that the life also of Jesus

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:44.480
might be made manifest in our body.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.519
For we which live are always delivered unto death

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.519
for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:54.440
might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.359
So then death worketh in us but life in you,

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:00.839
we having the same spirit of faith,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.040
according as it is written,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.200
I believed and therefore have I spoken,

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:07.239
we also believe and therefore speak,

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.399
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.959
shall raise up us also by Jesus

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.059
and shall present us with you.

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.179
For all things are for your sakes

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:23.079
that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:27.440
of many redound to the glory of God,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.440
for which cause we faint not.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.480
But though our outward man perish,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.519
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.720
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.720
worketh for us a far more exceeding

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.480
and eternal weight of glory.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.320
While we look not at the things which are seen,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.179
but the things which are not seen,

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.519
for the things which are seen are temporal,

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:59.399
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:01.600
This morning as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600
and consider this thought, we faint not,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.160
I want you to notice number one, the pressures.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.380
The pressures.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.079
Again, I mentioned by way of introduction

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.640
that the Apostle Paul is going to speak

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.720
with great transparency in this portion of Scripture.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.839
In fact, in the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.640
he not only speaks here,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.720
but he speaks again in chapter number 11

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.320
and again in chapter number 12

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.459
with great transparency with regard to the pressures

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:26.920
that he experienced.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.820
We understand this morning that life is full of pressure

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.940
and here for just a few verses,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.900
we have the opportunity to get a glimpse

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.179
into what the Apostle Paul experienced.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:42.119
I would say this, that he had physical pressures.

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:44.700
He had emotional pressures.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.599
I would say this, he had external pressures,

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:50.820
but he had internal pressures.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.460
And begin to think about the pressures

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.880
that the Apostle Paul faced,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.460
we find and we won't take the time to read it

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.400
in 2 Corinthians 11,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.400
but in verses 24 through 28,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.479
Paul lists out a whole lot of things that he suffered

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:06.700
and that he dealt with and those difficulties.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.440
He ends it at the end of verse 28

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.659
and talks about that which came upon him daily,

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.859
the care of all the churches.

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:16.200
He says in the 12th chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.520
he says in verse number 14 and 15,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.140
behold, the third time I am ready to come to you

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.679
and I will not be burdensome to you

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:26.280
for I seek not yours, but you.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.320
For the children ought not to lay up for the parents,

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:29.760
but the parents for the children.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.640
And here's what he says in verse 15,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.460
I will very gladly spend and be spent for you,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.719
though the more abundantly I love you,

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.479
the less I be loved.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:43.400
He says to the churches in the region of Galatians,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.080
Galatians chapter number four,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.520
he asked this question, have I become your enemy

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.679
because I tell you the truth?

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:52.940
See, the Apostle Paul knew what pressures were.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.520
He understood the pressures of ministry.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.760
He experienced the pressures of ministry.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.159
Paul is not speaking here about.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.559
something that he read somewhere else from someone else.

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:07.439
He's speaking personally about what he experienced

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:09.159
and the joy as we look at here,

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.319
and I wanna make sure that it's packaged together

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.319
because I said by way of introduction

00:10:13.319 --> 00:10:16.239
that there were hardships, but there's God's help.

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:18.559
And so we look first at the pressures

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.659
in which the Apostle Paul faced.

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:24.399
He says in verse number eight of 2 Corinthians 4,

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.439
notice he says this, we are troubled.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:30.719
He says this, on every side.

00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:33.639
We are troubled on every side.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.439
To be troubled means to be afflicted.

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:37.599
It means to suffer persecution.

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:40.839
It means to be pressed hard upon.

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.679
And the Apostle Paul says that we are troubled

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:44.959
on every side.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:47.799
Can you imagine, can you get in your mind this morning

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:50.479
a visual, if you will, of what the Apostle Paul

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:52.799
is seeking to communicate with regard

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.959
to the pressures of ministry

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.399
and understanding this thought of being troubled.

00:10:58.239 --> 00:10:59.399
He says in verse number eight,

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.919
and we're just looking at the pressures at this point.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.479
We'll look in just a moment at the counter

00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:06.079
of each of these, but in verse number eight,

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:08.679
he says we are perplexed.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:11.159
Ever been perplexed in life?

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.799
I mean, the idea of being perplexed

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.959
is to be without resources, to be in straits.

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:17.799
It carries with it this idea of not knowing

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:20.639
which way to turn.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:21.979
Can I tell you that there are times

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:23.399
in which you might be perplexed,

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.199
and it's not because you don't know the leadership

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.719
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:29.199
It's because you're concerned about the consequences

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.299
of the decision that you're going to make.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.719
Let me say that again.

00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:37.779
Being perplexed is not always because you don't know

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:40.359
the direction of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:43.539
Sometimes you're perplexed ministry-wise.

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:45.519
I'll speak as a pastor this morning.

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:47.479
You're perplexed because you know

00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:49.039
that if you make the decision,

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.439
there's gonna be a fallout.

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:55.159
There's gonna be people that aren't gonna be happy.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.599
You understand what I'm saying?

00:11:57.439 --> 00:12:00.479
Sometimes it's not that you don't have the direction,

00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:03.319
it's that you're concerned about the consequence.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:06.399
We find that Paul says we're perplexed.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:09.319
He says troubled on every side, perplexed.

00:12:09.319 --> 00:12:12.359
He says this in verse number nine, persecuted.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.459
Persecuted.

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:18.599
Literally, the idea is to put to flight.

00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:21.839
The idea is to drive away.

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:25.199
Now, Paul knew something about persecution from both sides.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:29.199
He knew what it was to be a persecutor, amen?

00:12:29.199 --> 00:12:32.519
He went, he had the letters, he had the authority,

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.739
he had the power, and he knew what it was

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:37.759
to go and find any that were of that way.

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:41.319
But then he experienced greatly

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:43.079
what it was to be the persecuted.

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:46.879
Somebody's phone is ringing, amen?

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:47.919
Praise the Lord.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:52.919
To put to flight, to drive away.

00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:59.239
He says in verse number nine, notice he says persecuted,

00:12:59.239 --> 00:13:01.959
and then he says cast down.

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:03.519
There it is again, hallelujah.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:07.039
Put them on speakerphone.

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:11.239
Cast down.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.479
It literally means to throw to the ground.

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.719
That's what it means, to be cast down.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.999
Three times a charm, amen?

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:25.839
Praise the Lord.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.119
Yeah, amen.

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:28.519
Call her out right there, amen?

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.319
Keep on preaching.

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:31.559
So to throw to the ground,

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.239
maybe you need to do that with that phone.

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:35.319
Cast down, amen?

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:37.799
But Paul says, as he's talking about the pressures,

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.399
he says troubled on every side.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:45.319
He says perplexed, persecuted, cast down.

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:49.799
He's sharing his heart, he's sharing with transparency.

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:54.559
Listen, it's a false thing for someone to stand up and say,

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.439
there's not gonna be any pressures in life.

00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:59.199
I mean, we got folks, we got people

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:01.959
that have all sorts of different backgrounds in our church

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:05.239
and all kinds of experiences, all different stages of life.

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:08.059
It'd be silly for a married couple to say to a couple

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:10.079
that's getting ready to get married and say,

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.879
there's no pressures in marriage.

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:16.479
No, it'd be silly to someone

00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:18.719
that just recently had a newborn to say,

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.239
oh, there's no pressures in raising children.

00:14:22.239 --> 00:14:25.679
There are pressures, there are difficulties.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:29.399
And it'd be equally wrong for someone in ministry

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:33.399
to say someone else that's going into ministry,

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:35.679
oh, there are no pressures in ministry.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:36.859
There are pressures.

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:39.479
I've been working with Fernando.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:43.199
He announced his call to missions.

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.839
And it's changed the dynamic

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.919
of some of our meetings and discipleship.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:50.559
And this week when we met for a couple of hours,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:54.519
I shared with him, hey, listen, understand in ministry,

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.239
there's some difficulties.

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:58.739
He's getting ready to teach his first lesson.

00:14:58.739 --> 00:14:59.579
You know what I told him?

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:00.599
I said, there's gonna be some that are gonna say

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.699
it's the best thing they ever heard.

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.059
And there's gonna be somebody else that asked you

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:05.959
what language you were speaking.

00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:08.519
That's what I told him, because he speaks two languages.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.039
But what was I trying to communicate to him?

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.699
Look, you can't please everybody.

00:15:12.819 --> 00:15:14.479
I preached a message about a year and a half ago

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:18.379
on the audience of one, the audience of one.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:21.839
Because you try to please everybody, you get crazy.

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:25.539
The pressures.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:27.079
I read this little book a couple of Sunday,

00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:29.439
actually three Sundays ago now.

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.679
Many of you know Don Sisk, just a simple book.

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.979
It's only like a half hour to read this book, if that.

00:15:33.979 --> 00:15:37.799
It's like 85 pages, but just a small 85 pages.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:40.039
Don Sisk was the director, he was a missionary in Japan.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.319
He was a pastor for a number of years,

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:42.919
went to be a missionary in Japan,

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:46.599
and then was the director at BIMI for a number of years.

00:15:46.599 --> 00:15:49.239
And so Don Sisk, I always thought it was kind of funny,

00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:51.239
he wrote a book called Fourth Quarter.

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:55.359
And he used the parallels of the sports world,

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.479
if you will, in analogy.

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:57.879
So he wrote a book, Fourth Quarter,

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:00.799
how to serve God in the fourth quarter of your life.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.879
It was a good book, I enjoyed reading it.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:06.279
And then he wrote a book entitled Overtime.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.919
Why did he write a book called Overtime?

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:11.159
Well, because he lived past 80, he's about 92 now,

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:14.999
and he's about 85, 86, and he wrote a book called Overtime.

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:18.599
And how to serve God in the overtime years.

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:20.399
It was a good book, I enjoyed reading it.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.679
And I remember saying to Holly,

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:22.999
after he wrote that book Overtime,

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:24.679
I said, the only other sports analogy

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.519
I could think of is sudden death.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.599
I can't think of another one.

00:16:28.599 --> 00:16:32.739
And I said, sudden death must be the title of his next book.

00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:33.839
But that'd be kind of weird,

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:35.619
because then he can't write the book,

00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:36.899
because there was sudden death,

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.619
and we're just kind of joking about it.

00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:40.739
And so here's the title of his newest book,

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:43.139
How to Stay in the Ministry Your Whole Life.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:44.939
I like that better than sudden death.

00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:46.919
And, but he wrote this little book,

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:49.019
and as I read this little book three weeks ago

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:52.379
on a Sunday afternoon, that book contained in it

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.479
some statistics about ministry.

00:16:55.419 --> 00:16:57.299
Can I tell you this morning, it broke my heart

00:16:57.299 --> 00:17:00.019
when I read the statistics about ministry.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.419
Let me just share a few with you.

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:07.419
They say that 50%, 50% that begin pastoring

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:10.219
won't last five years.

00:17:12.739 --> 00:17:16.299
They won't last five years, 50%.

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:17.779
Let me share this one with you.

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:22.779
Only 10% that start out pastoring retire as a pastor.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:31.119
That means 90% along the way either die before retirement,

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:34.339
or they do something different.

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:37.099
That's a huge number.

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:41.139
Now, this statistic is in this book,

00:17:41.139 --> 00:17:44.159
and I looked it up to try to validate some of these things,

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:46.139
and those two I could find easily

00:17:47.139 --> 00:17:49.139
from a number of different sources.

00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:52.739
But the one that's very concerning

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:55.619
is the number of pastors that leave the ministry

00:17:55.619 --> 00:17:57.339
every month in America.

00:17:58.339 --> 00:18:03.339
It's varied, so I'm gonna be transparent with you.

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:08.339
The lowest number that I saw was 250 pastors per month

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:10.059
leave the ministry.

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:15.059
The highest number I saw was 1,700 pastors per month

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:16.199
leave the ministry.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:20.859
The consistent number that I saw was 1,500.

00:18:22.099 --> 00:18:24.419
This book, How to Stay in the Ministry Your Whole Life

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:28.659
said 1,500 per month leave the ministry.

00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:31.819
It's hard for us to wrap our minds around that.

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.019
But the reality is that we know,

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:36.819
we see some of this taking place where today

00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:39.859
there are so many churches in America

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:41.619
that do not have pastors today.

00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:45.259
There are churches that I know here in Virginia

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:47.379
without a pastor, and I mean,

00:18:47.379 --> 00:18:48.659
it's not that they don't have,

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:52.039
there's no prospect for a pastor.

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:54.979
There's no one that they have lined up

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.579
to come be their pastor.

00:18:57.719 --> 00:19:00.519
I talked with a friend on the phone on Wednesday,

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:02.479
and as I chatted with this ministry friend,

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:07.139
he shared with me that currently he's a missionary,

00:19:07.139 --> 00:19:09.039
he's got a number of supporting churches

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:11.199
that don't have a pastor.

00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:13.039
And he said, of the supporting churches

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.559
that I have without a pastor,

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:17.639
not one of them have even a prospect

00:19:17.639 --> 00:19:20.000
of who would be their next pastor.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.879
He shared with me accounts of men

00:19:21.879 --> 00:19:24.479
that have worked diligently to try to find

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:26.919
their replacement with zero success.

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:30.559
It's a sad thing, it's a sad state

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.299
that we're dealing with, with our churches.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.500
I don't believe that it's that God stopped calling.

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:41.399
I don't believe that.

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:44.299
Part of it is the fact that people

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:46.099
have stopped responding to the call.

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:48.779
But I think there's also a truth

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:51.899
of the pressures of ministry.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:53.139
The pressures.

00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:54.599
You look up some of the statistics,

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:57.019
they're wild, they blow your mind,

00:19:57.019 --> 00:19:59.339
as to some of the pressures.

00:19:59.339 --> 00:20:00.899
When you begin to think about.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.179
about the Apostle Paul here,

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:05.579
and he's speaking again with great transparency,

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:10.059
and he says, look, there are pressures that we face.

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:10.899
There are pressures.

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:13.419
Listen, you're gonna face pressures in your life.

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:14.759
And what you're gonna find in your life,

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:17.899
you're never gonna make everyone happy either.

00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:19.499
Amen?

00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:22.499
You're not gonna ever make everyone happy.

00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:25.819
Why do you think your pastor's gonna make everyone happy?

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:28.019
It's unreasonable, is it not?

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:28.859
Honestly.

00:20:29.699 --> 00:20:31.299
I like this, I don't like that, I like that.

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:32.579
You know how it works.

00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:36.419
And the reality is that Paul says there's great pressures.

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:39.559
But I want you to see number two.

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:42.739
With great pressures, there's great provision.

00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:44.179
Praise the Lord.

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:47.739
It's not all negative, but there's a negative aspect.

00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:50.019
I mean, there's reality, there's truth,

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:52.239
there's transparency.

00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:53.659
And Paul says there's pressures,

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:56.959
but let me remind you that though there's great pressures,

00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:58.439
there's great provision.

00:20:58.439 --> 00:20:59.799
Why is it great provision?

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.699
Because it's God's provision.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.439
And we find here that if we look

00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:07.039
and we were to categorize it into two thoughts,

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:11.699
that the provision comes first in the form of God's grace.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:14.719
The provision comes first in the form of God's grace.

00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:16.559
And we're reminded of 2 Corinthians 12

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:20.279
and verse number nine that God's grace is sufficient.

00:21:21.139 --> 00:21:24.159
That God's grace is sufficient.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.279
And we find that in the text of Scripture,

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:29.359
we only looked at the pressures,

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:31.339
but notice in verse number eight,

00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:33.979
as we go back and look at both sides of this,

00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:36.959
that Paul says we are troubled on every side.

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:39.919
Then notice he says, yet not distressed.

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:42.059
I mean, we're troubled on every side,

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:43.079
but we're not distressed.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:44.439
You know what it means not to be distressed?

00:21:44.439 --> 00:21:47.119
It means to not be discouraged.

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:48.679
To not be discouraged.

00:21:48.679 --> 00:21:49.899
Do you know that discouragement,

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:52.419
I shared this several weeks ago in another message,

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:54.159
but discouragement is one of the tools

00:21:54.199 --> 00:21:56.599
that Satan uses most often.

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:58.719
It's a tool in the toolbox of Satan

00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:02.119
that he loves to use to discourage people.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:05.119
I know people right now that I could call on the phone

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:07.519
that were pastors when I started pastoring,

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:10.039
pastors that started after I started pastoring,

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:12.599
that are no longer pastors today.

00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:14.279
You know what a lot of them say?

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:15.319
They're discouraged.

00:22:16.399 --> 00:22:17.479
They're discouraged.

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.099
But Paul says, don't forget God's provision.

00:22:22.939 --> 00:22:27.219
Yes, there are pressures, but oh, there's provision.

00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:29.259
Yes, we're troubled on every side,

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:32.039
but we're not distressed, we're not discouraged.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:32.879
Why?

00:22:32.879 --> 00:22:34.739
Well, we'll get to the why at the end of the text

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:37.679
because he's got an eternal focus, not a temporal focus.

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:41.779
He's got a focus of pleasing God, not pleasing man.

00:22:41.779 --> 00:22:44.099
And we find that he says we're not distressed.

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:45.939
He says, number two, in verse number eight,

00:22:45.939 --> 00:22:48.659
when he mentions about we are perplexed,

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:50.499
but not in despair.

00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:55.499
To not be, he says, we're not without hope.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:58.339
He says this, we're not depressed.

00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:01.699
You hear that word often used about depression.

00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:03.479
I read a bunch of statistics this week.

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:05.779
I can't remember exactly the number, so don't quote me,

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:08.519
but it was about 45%, if I remember correctly,

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:11.619
of pastors that were surveyed that reported

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:14.219
they were depressed.

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:16.299
Let me ask you this, if the pastor's depressed,

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:17.939
how's he gonna lead the ministry?

00:23:20.979 --> 00:23:23.459
If you're depressed, how are you leading your home?

00:23:24.899 --> 00:23:26.139
You know what I'm saying?

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:28.499
It's a great number.

00:23:28.499 --> 00:23:31.739
But Paul says God's provision, his grace.

00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:35.459
Oh yeah, I'm perplexed, but I'm not in despair.

00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:37.099
I'm not without hope.

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:38.499
I'm not depressed.

00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:41.459
He says this in verse number nine, persecuted.

00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:44.539
Oh yeah, we're persecuted, but not forsaken.

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:45.979
It means not to be abandoned.

00:23:45.979 --> 00:23:48.059
It means not to be deserted.

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:50.099
It means not to be deserted.

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:51.939
Oh, I'm so reminded of the truth,

00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:53.579
and I used it by way of introduction,

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:55.219
that there's hardships, but there's help.

00:23:55.219 --> 00:23:58.259
And our God, it says in Hebrews 13, verse five and six,

00:23:58.259 --> 00:23:59.099
at the end of verse five,

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:01.459
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee,

00:24:01.459 --> 00:24:04.399
so that we might boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:08.339
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:10.099
Listen, I'm not abandoned.

00:24:10.099 --> 00:24:11.339
I'm not deserted.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:13.799
There are times, loneliness, it's on the top list

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:16.159
of those that are talking, these pastors

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:17.859
that were interviewed and surveyed.

00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:19.979
Oh, they feel loneliness, they feel,

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:22.199
no, no, the Holy Spirit's with us.

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:26.939
The Holy Spirit's with us, and as we look here,

00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:30.859
and we see God's provision, we rejoice

00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:32.659
in knowing that in the pressures,

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:36.339
there's also the provision, and this is true in your life

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.179
just as much as it's true in my life.

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.859
This is true in the lives of the believers

00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:43.019
in the church in Corinth as much as it was

00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:45.099
in the life of the apostle Paul.

00:24:45.939 --> 00:24:48.259
And he says in verse number nine,

00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:51.799
we're cast down, but not destroyed.

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:57.299
Cast down, but not destroyed, the idea, obviously,

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:01.219
to be killed or to be rendered useless.

00:25:01.219 --> 00:25:04.579
I think Paul had a fear of becoming a castaway.

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:06.579
Mentioned in 1 Corinthians chapter nine.

00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:10.819
Paul understood God had a purpose for his life,

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:13.699
and God understood he faced great pressures.

00:25:13.699 --> 00:25:15.899
Again, the pressures that he faced,

00:25:15.899 --> 00:25:17.099
there were physical pressures,

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:18.379
there were emotional pressures,

00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:20.139
there were external pressures,

00:25:20.139 --> 00:25:22.179
there were internal pressures.

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:28.619
And I think as you look at 1 Corinthians chapter number 11,

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:32.219
excuse me, chapter number, yeah, 11, verses 24 through 28,

00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:34.299
I think it was the internal pressures

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:37.059
that affected Paul more than the external pressures.

00:25:38.879 --> 00:25:41.579
I think it was the internal pressures.

00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:43.339
I think about your own family, your own life.

00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:46.179
When you got pressures internally in your home,

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:47.379
it's a lot harder to deal with

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.379
than when a neighbor's got a problem with you.

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:51.219
Am I right?

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:55.659
I think it was the internal that affected him the most.

00:25:55.659 --> 00:25:57.139
But you know what Paul says?

00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:58.979
Oh, there's all these pressures,

00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:02.739
but there's God's provision, there's God's grace,

00:26:02.739 --> 00:26:04.779
and God's grace is sufficient.

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:09.179
We continue reading, and we begin to see in verses 10,

00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:10.699
down through verse number 15,

00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:13.419
how Paul will continue to kind of expound

00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:15.499
on what he's listed in verses eight and nine.

00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:17.939
He says, always bearing about in the body

00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:20.099
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:21.659
that the life also of Jesus

00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:23.619
might be made manifest in our body.

00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:24.459
Think about Paul.

00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:25.659
I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:27.219
he says, I'm crucified with Christ.

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:28.739
He says, I die daily.

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:30.299
It's that constant reminder.

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:32.819
I said to Fernando on Thursday when we met,

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:34.819
I said, Fernando, you need to learn to be dead

00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:37.899
to compliment and to criticism.

00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:40.739
And he could tell you,

00:26:40.739 --> 00:26:42.779
I'll tell you transparently right here.

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:44.339
Here's what I told him on Thursday.

00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:47.939
For me personally, it's easy to be dead to compliment.

00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:50.979
It's hard to be dead to criticism.

00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:52.619
That's just me personally.

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:54.739
Some people are completely opposite.

00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:57.059
They couldn't care less what you said about them.

00:26:57.939 --> 00:26:58.779
They're dead to criticism.

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:00.259
It doesn't affect them one bit.

00:27:00.259 --> 00:27:02.059
They don't give two thoughts about it.

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:03.219
But you start complimenting them,

00:27:03.219 --> 00:27:04.379
and man, their head gets big,

00:27:04.379 --> 00:27:06.179
and they get all kinds of puffed up.

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:09.499
We're all different.

00:27:09.499 --> 00:27:10.459
Here's what I told Fernando.

00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:11.459
You gotta know you.

00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:13.619
You gotta know you.

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:15.499
What affects you?

00:27:16.379 --> 00:27:18.259
How does it impact you?

00:27:18.259 --> 00:27:21.619
But we need to remember that we're dead with Christ.

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:22.779
We're dead with Christ.

00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:24.579
Notice verse 11.

00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:28.939
For we which live are always delivered

00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:30.859
unto death for Jesus' sake.

00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:33.339
The life also of Jesus might be made manifest

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:35.339
in our mortal flesh.

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:37.299
So then death worketh in us,

00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:38.539
but life in you.

00:27:39.499 --> 00:27:43.219
We, having the same spirit of faith,

00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:44.539
according as it is written,

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:47.499
I believed and therefore have I spoken.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:50.979
We also believe and therefore speak.

00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:54.299
He quotes back to the psalmist in Psalm 116.

00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:56.739
And I'm so thankful that we've been given truth,

00:27:56.739 --> 00:27:58.819
and then we speak the truth.

00:27:58.819 --> 00:28:00.459
We have been, listen, in 1 John,

00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:02.499
you read 1 John, chapter number one,

00:28:02.499 --> 00:28:04.819
John starts out talking about we're his witnesses.

00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:07.299
We're eyewitnesses of this.

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:09.619
And we speak what we have received

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:11.499
and what a blessing it is to know

00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:12.739
that God would use us.

00:28:12.739 --> 00:28:14.419
And we come to verse number 15.

00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:17.099
I'll get to verse 14 here in just a moment.

00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:18.699
But I want you to see verse number 15.

00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.379
For all things are for your sakes

00:28:21.379 --> 00:28:23.419
that the abundant grace

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:25.859
might through the thanksgiving of many

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:28.499
redound to the glory of God.

00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:30.699
Now I want you to think about verse 15.

00:28:30.699 --> 00:28:33.019
He speaks about all things are for your sakes.

00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:34.699
Paul was a man that was surrendered.

00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:36.299
He was yielded.

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:37.659
He understood for me to live as Christ

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:38.979
and to die as gain.

00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:40.659
Paul says to the church in Philippi,

00:28:40.659 --> 00:28:42.379
even after he makes that statement,

00:28:42.379 --> 00:28:44.379
he says that it's more needful for you

00:28:44.379 --> 00:28:45.339
that I'm here, why?

00:28:45.339 --> 00:28:47.699
Because he understood that God was using him

00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:49.379
to help them.

00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:50.259
He understood that.

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.499
He understood the principle.

00:28:51.499 --> 00:28:55.419
He understood the way that God designed it to work.

00:28:55.419 --> 00:28:57.179
And he says all things are for your sakes.

00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:58.659
And then he makes this statement

00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:00.899
that the abundant grace,

00:29:00.899 --> 00:29:03.419
think about that just for a moment.

00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:05.219
We sing about God's amazing grace,

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:06.979
but we read and we talk about

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:07.859
as we get in the scriptures

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:09.579
about God's abundant grace.

00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:11.619
Paul makes note in 1 Timothy

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.659
about how God's grace is abundant

00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:14.899
and it was toward him

00:29:14.899 --> 00:29:17.499
and how he trusted Christ as a savior

00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:20.739
and he rejoices in the grace of God.

00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:23.179
We can begin to think about the grace,

00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:24.019
speaking of which,

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:25.819
we talk about the enabling grace,

00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:28.339
the grace to serve God.

00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:29.259
He gives us that grace.

00:29:29.259 --> 00:29:30.219
It's abundant.

00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:31.579
But notice what he says.

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:35.899
Might through the thanksgiving of many.

00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:39.059
Now Paul's there just for a moment.

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:42.019
How thankful are we for God's grace?

00:29:42.019 --> 00:29:43.459
But then we can ask ourselves this question.

00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:45.339
How thankful are we in general?

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:49.619
How thankful are we in general?

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:52.419
We know the verses in everything give thanks

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:55.139
for this is the will of God

00:29:55.139 --> 00:29:57.059
and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:00.939
It says that through the thanksgiving of many,

00:30:00.939 --> 00:30:07.759
down to the glory of God. You know when we give thanks, it pleases God. I'm being honest

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:15.219
with you this morning. When we give thanks, it brings glory to God, it pleases God when

00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:24.079
we thank Him. You know what's so easy? To complain. To complain. Complain about everything.

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:29.739
I mean honestly, if we examine our lives, we complain about so many things. It's too

00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:36.899
hot, it's too cold. I like this, I don't like that. This was, it was too loud, it was

00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:42.579
too soft, it was too this, it was too that. You understand what I'm saying? You know what

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:49.099
the Bible says about complaining? The Old Testament word is murmur. I actually like

00:30:49.099 --> 00:30:55.459
the word murmur more than I like complain. Because murmur just sounds bad. It does. You're

00:30:55.459 --> 00:31:01.059
murmuring. Just carry something with it that just, that's probably not a good thing. Even

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:04.659
if you don't know the definition of the word and somebody says, stop murmuring. You're

00:31:04.659 --> 00:31:10.339
like, hmm, that's probably, something's not right there. God heard their complaints and

00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:17.499
it says this, He was not pleased. He was not pleased. You read the book of Numbers. God

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:24.699
was serious. There's some consequences. God miraculously provided manna. What do the people

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:34.819
say? I don't like this stuff. My soul loatheth. Come on. Am I telling you the truth this morning?

00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:44.539
Come on. It was God's provision. I don't like it. Oh, that we were back in Egypt. Really?

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:51.179
Do you remember what Egypt was like? But is that not what they say? Sometimes we need

00:31:51.179 --> 00:32:02.379
a reset. We need a reset. He says in verse number 15 that it would read down to the

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:11.459
glory of God. Just be thankful. Can I use a simple illustration this morning? I'm going

00:32:11.459 --> 00:32:16.379
to say always, but I'm sure there are some times that I forget. I'm going to come down

00:32:16.379 --> 00:32:20.539
for a minute, Fernando. Fernando's learned how to do the sound. I think it's great. He's

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:26.419
going to need that one day. Seriously. I know enough about that stuff to get everything

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:38.859
in trouble. I purpose every day to thank Holly for the meals that she makes. But can I tell

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:46.299
you something, Ron? They're not always my favorite meal. Listen for a minute. It's not

00:32:46.299 --> 00:32:52.819
always my favorite meal, but I always thank her for the meal. You want to know one of

00:32:52.819 --> 00:33:02.139
the things we had last night for dinner? Brussels sprouts. That's just a bad word, man. Brussels

00:33:02.139 --> 00:33:07.139
sprouts. I do not like Brussels sprouts. In fact, there was a piece of a Brussels sprout

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:14.979
that got on my broccoli. It was contaminated. Amen? But you know what I did after dinner?

00:33:14.979 --> 00:33:22.019
I thanked her for dinner. She labored for that. She worked hard for that. And I appreciate

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:27.939
it. But you know what I could do? I could complain about it. We're having this again.

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:32.539
Don't you know I don't like that? Now, that wouldn't work out real good for her along.

00:33:32.539 --> 00:33:38.779
Am I right? But what do we do in church? Help me this morning. Help me this morning. What

00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:47.859
do we do in church? Right? And I thank her because I appreciate it. I'm not saying that

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:54.379
because I want anyone to thank me. I already told you, a compliment doesn't bother me.

00:33:54.379 --> 00:34:02.619
What I'm saying to you this morning is that sometimes we need a reset. We need a reset.

00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:09.259
Paul talks about the pressures, but he talks about the provision. I preached a message

00:34:09.259 --> 00:34:16.979
years ago on a Sunday morning from the book of Habakkuk. Somebody left here saying, I

00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:24.539
can't believe he would preach up from Habakkuk on Sunday morning. Yeah. Yeah. And there was

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:29.739
a visitor here that morning, husband and wife, and they sent me an email and said, we've

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:36.539
been doing our devotions to the book of Habakkuk and that helped us so much. What I'm saying

00:34:36.539 --> 00:34:44.819
to you this morning is that the pressures are real, but God's provision is real. We

00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:49.539
see not only God's grace, but we see God's power. Notice with me if we're looking at

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:53.659
the provision and we note it from two aspects. Number one, the grace of God. Number two,

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:59.579
the power of God. We see in verse number 16, he says this, for which cause we faint

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:06.619
not. Paul, how is it that you can go through and experience all these pressures of life?

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:14.619
How can you have these pressures of ministry? How can you not be like John Mark and go back?

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:22.379
Because God's grace and because of God's power. He says, for which cause we faint not, but

00:35:22.499 --> 00:35:27.739
though our outward man perish, can you imagine as we looked at verses 8 and 9 and all that

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:34.739
he explained, the outward man would perish, but he says this, yet the inward man is renewed

00:35:35.619 --> 00:35:42.459
day by day. Brother Mark's Sunday school class this morning about the Holy Spirit, the work

00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:47.579
of the Holy Spirit. And he went to Ephesians 3 and verse 16. I got it written in my notes

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:52.219
to go there. Because Paul, as he's praying for the believers in Ephesus, you know how

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:59.219
he prays for them that they be renewed with strength by the Spirit in their inner man.

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:04.819
And oh, we thank God for his power. We understand that the outward man might perish, but the

00:36:04.819 --> 00:36:11.819
inward man is renewed day by day. How is it renewed day by day? Oh, if you're not in God's

00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:18.619
Word, you have no idea how that happens. I'll be honest with you. If you're not doing devotions

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:25.619
regularly, if you're not in the Word of God, you're not having your inner man strengthened.

00:36:29.139 --> 00:36:32.539
There's no, here's what I've learned in the Christian life, there's no just status quo.

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:39.139
There's no just staying in an idle position. You're either going forward or you're going

00:36:39.139 --> 00:36:44.859
backwards. Honestly. You're either going forward or you're going backwards. And how is that

00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:51.979
inward man renewed? It's renewed, notice what he says, day by day. Can I tell you this morning,

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:58.619
if you wait until the point that you're ready to faint, I can't do this anymore, and then

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:05.619
you're like, I need to be strengthened. Oh, God is able, but you're kind of late. You

00:37:06.539 --> 00:37:13.539
need to be renewed day by day by day by day. And you go to it again and again and again.

00:37:13.979 --> 00:37:17.299
Brother Jeff and I were talking when we're stapling and we're talking about some things

00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:21.859
that we've just recently seen in God's Word as we've been doing our devotions and reading

00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:26.779
and studying and it's like, man, there's things that God will point out. I've been preaching,

00:37:26.779 --> 00:37:33.119
I've preached like 2,000 messages. I've preached through entirely like 25 books of the Bible

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:38.899
since I've been the pastor here, verse by verse, and yet every day, I don't, listen,

00:37:38.899 --> 00:37:44.059
I don't go to the Bible just to find a sermon. I read this book every day of my life because

00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:50.059
I need it. And the reality is that God will show me things, I'm like, man, that's really

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:56.339
good. Oh, God, I needed that today. Thank you for encouraging me with that truth. And

00:37:56.339 --> 00:38:01.939
then maybe I'll have an interaction at some point later that day or that week and God

00:38:01.939 --> 00:38:06.979
has prepared me for that interaction that I would have with a truth from God's Word

00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:13.499
that can be shared with someone else. And he says the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:38:13.499 --> 00:38:17.659
This morning, the pressures, the provision, but I want you to notice finally this morning

00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:24.659
the perspective. The perspective. We know in verse number 14 that Paul had great confidence.

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:31.699
Notice how he begins verse number 14, knowing. Knowing. He doesn't say that he's thinking

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:36.539
that this might be the case. No, he says knowing. Listen, there's some things that God wants

00:38:36.539 --> 00:38:43.539
you to know. We sang the song this morning to start when we all get to heaven, right?

00:38:44.059 --> 00:38:47.859
Or was it The Roll is Caught Up Yonder? Which one did we sing? The Roll is Caught Up Yonder.

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:52.619
The Roll is Caught Up Yonder. Mr. Black, I think, is the one that wrote that song. And

00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:59.619
he says this, when the roll is caught up yonder, I might be there. That's not what he said.

00:38:59.939 --> 00:39:06.939
He said I will be there. Confidence. Confidence. Notice what Paul mentions that he knows in

00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:15.059
verse number 14. Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus. Hey, by the way, we serve

00:39:15.459 --> 00:39:21.099
a risen Savior, don't we? Oh, we serve a risen Savior. He's alive. He rules. He reigns. He's

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:27.419
coming back one day. Hallelujah. And he says knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus

00:39:27.419 --> 00:39:34.419
shall. Certainty. Certainty. Shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:42.859
you. Man, it's a beautiful picture that God gives us in one verse of scripture. And we

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:48.979
know, listen, this truth is that death has no power over us. If we've been saved by the

00:39:48.979 --> 00:39:55.019
grace of God, we will, listen, Christ is the first fruits, 1 Corinthians 15, we will rise

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:59.939
again. And what a joy that is. And he says that he'll present us. I want you to think

00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:00.819
just for a moment.

00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:02.459
of the truth of the church.

00:40:02.459 --> 00:40:05.119
The individual believers make up the church,

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.379
but the church is known as the body of Christ,

00:40:07.379 --> 00:40:10.139
but also the bride of Christ.

00:40:10.139 --> 00:40:12.179
And who's gonna do, who's gonna present us?

00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:14.059
You read Ephesians chapter number five,

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:15.859
and you begin reading about the church

00:40:15.859 --> 00:40:18.859
and the relationship between the husbands and wives.

00:40:18.859 --> 00:40:21.139
And then you find that the Bible talks about

00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:22.739
how husbands are to love their wives,

00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:26.659
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it

00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.099
in Ephesians chapter number five.

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:29.799
And he goes on to say this,

00:40:29.799 --> 00:40:34.259
that he, Christ, might sanctify and cleanse it, the church,

00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:36.459
with the washing of water by the blood

00:40:36.459 --> 00:40:41.059
that he might present it to himself, a glorious church,

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:43.639
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,

00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:47.099
but that it should be holy and without blemish.

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:50.219
Oh, what a day it's gonna be when we get to heaven.

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:51.299
I'm serious.

00:40:52.259 --> 00:40:54.619
Heaven's gonna be a wonderful place.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:56.179
Not everybody in heaven's gonna be thinking

00:40:56.179 --> 00:40:57.679
the same way you think either.

00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:01.699
I know we're gonna be glorified,

00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:03.419
but there's some things that God's gonna straighten out,

00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:04.259
I think.

00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:09.179
But he says he's gonna present us.

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:10.899
Think about that this morning.

00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:13.139
Paul said knowing, but then I want you to see

00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:18.059
the focus of Paul, his perspective.

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:20.939
We're gonna read verse 18 and then go back to verse 17

00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:23.259
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four.

00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:25.259
Verse 18 says, while we look not at the things

00:41:25.259 --> 00:41:27.819
which are seen, but of things which are not seen.

00:41:28.499 --> 00:41:29.659
That's the focus of Paul.

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:32.499
Where's my focus, where's your focus?

00:41:32.499 --> 00:41:34.179
Can I tell you this morning it's really easy

00:41:34.179 --> 00:41:35.939
to look at the things that are seen?

00:41:37.259 --> 00:41:39.139
It requires discipline to look at the things

00:41:39.139 --> 00:41:40.059
that are not seen.

00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:42.939
Requires discipline.

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:45.259
To have an eternal focus.

00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:46.619
Oh, you gotta work on it.

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:48.779
Why, because the things which are seen,

00:41:48.779 --> 00:41:50.859
those are things right in front of you.

00:41:50.859 --> 00:41:52.939
Those things, those are the pressures.

00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:55.099
Those are the difficulties, those are the distress,

00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:57.139
that's what that is.

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:58.899
And Paul says, while we look not at the things

00:41:58.899 --> 00:42:02.259
which are seen, but of the things which are not seen,

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:06.899
notice he says this, for the things which are seen

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:11.899
are temporal, but the things which are not seen

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:13.819
are eternal.

00:42:13.819 --> 00:42:16.659
Oh, that God would help us to have an eternal focus.

00:42:18.299 --> 00:42:19.659
An eternal focus.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:22.979
Sometimes we get sideways about things here on Earth.

00:42:22.979 --> 00:42:24.739
How many of you ever had a disagreement with your wife?

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:26.579
Don't raise your hand.

00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:28.819
How many of you ever had a disagreement with your wife?

00:42:28.819 --> 00:42:31.059
And afterwards, never?

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.899
He's coming to the altar this morning, amen?

00:42:34.899 --> 00:42:36.499
He'd be the first one here before Kimberly

00:42:36.499 --> 00:42:38.819
hits the first note, amen?

00:42:38.819 --> 00:42:39.819
But here, listen.

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:43.579
Sometimes we have a disagreement with our wife

00:42:44.499 --> 00:42:46.579
and it's over something so insignificant.

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:50.819
We're sideways with each other, problems.

00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:55.219
And you sit down and say, what actually happened?

00:42:56.059 --> 00:42:57.779
And you start figuring out and you're like,

00:42:57.779 --> 00:43:00.099
that's kind of, shouldn't use these words,

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:03.739
but stupid, dumb, silly, whatever word you want to use.

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:06.259
Why?

00:43:06.259 --> 00:43:09.419
See, sometimes we're just so temporally focused.

00:43:10.699 --> 00:43:13.819
God says we need to get an eternal focus.

00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:15.339
We look not at the things which are seen,

00:43:15.339 --> 00:43:16.779
but the things which are not seen.

00:43:16.779 --> 00:43:18.779
And we have to ask ourselves this morning,

00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:19.899
where's our focus?

00:43:19.899 --> 00:43:23.179
See, his perspective, the perspective of Paul

00:43:23.179 --> 00:43:27.619
impacted how he responded to the pressures of life.

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:30.299
Can I tell you this morning that your perspective

00:43:30.299 --> 00:43:33.099
is going to impact how you respond to the pressures?

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:35.459
You're gonna have pressures, I guarantee you.

00:43:36.419 --> 00:43:39.739
And your perspective is going to impact

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:43.299
how you respond to those pressures.

00:43:43.299 --> 00:43:46.139
And we find that here in verse number 17,

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:49.099
we see really the response of Paul

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:52.339
and it's all impacted because of the proper perspective

00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:54.139
that he had and the Bible says,

00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:58.299
notice what Paul says, for our light affliction.

00:43:58.299 --> 00:44:01.499
Now, if you've ever read anything about the Apostle Paul

00:44:01.499 --> 00:44:03.579
and you've ever read anything about the things

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:06.339
that he suffered, the pressures that he endured,

00:44:06.339 --> 00:44:08.739
you would scratch your head on trying to figure out

00:44:08.739 --> 00:44:11.379
why it would be termed light affliction.

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:15.499
He stoned and left for dead.

00:44:15.499 --> 00:44:17.219
I believe God raised him up.

00:44:18.419 --> 00:44:20.019
Listen, I mean, you begin to think about

00:44:20.019 --> 00:44:23.579
all that Paul suffered and he says,

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:26.499
our light affliction, but then notice

00:44:26.499 --> 00:44:28.499
it goes a moment further, he says,

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.299
or it goes a page further, he says,

00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:34.659
which is but for a moment.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:38.099
Now, when in Paul's ministry did he not suffer hardship?

00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:41.539
You're gonna have a hard time reading in the Gospel

00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:44.739
or in the book of Acts, reading through the epistles,

00:44:44.739 --> 00:44:46.739
you're gonna have a hard time finding a time

00:44:46.779 --> 00:44:50.779
in Paul's ministry where he wasn't facing pressures.

00:44:50.779 --> 00:44:52.259
He says, but for a moment.

00:44:53.299 --> 00:44:54.739
Why does he say it's for a moment?

00:44:54.739 --> 00:44:57.859
Paul, it's your whole Christian life.

00:44:57.859 --> 00:45:01.619
From the time you got saved to the time you were beheaded,

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:04.379
I mean, for all of it, you face pressures,

00:45:04.379 --> 00:45:05.939
but it's just a moment, why?

00:45:05.939 --> 00:45:08.259
Because I'm looking to eternity

00:45:08.259 --> 00:45:11.539
and I'm gonna be with my Savior forever.

00:45:11.539 --> 00:45:14.059
And it's just a moment, it's just light affliction.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:16.939
By the way, what did our Savior suffer for us?

00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:19.659
What did he suffer for us?

00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:25.499
For the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross.

00:45:25.499 --> 00:45:28.379
This word affliction in verse number 17

00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:31.339
of our text of Scripture, the word troubled

00:45:31.339 --> 00:45:33.779
in verse number eight is the root word

00:45:33.779 --> 00:45:35.459
for that word affliction.

00:45:35.459 --> 00:45:36.579
We're troubled on every side,

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:38.699
we're dealing with these afflictions.

00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:40.259
This morning again in Sunday school,

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.579
Mark went over to Psalm 119, the psalmist says,

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:44.619
it was good for me to be afflicted.

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:46.459
Now, most of us would never say that.

00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:50.219
Why, we don't like being afflicted.

00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:52.259
Are we honest this morning?

00:45:52.259 --> 00:45:54.019
You don't like affliction?

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:56.419
But the psalmist says it was good for me to be afflicted,

00:45:56.419 --> 00:45:59.859
why, because then I learned thy statutes.

00:45:59.859 --> 00:46:02.179
There's some things that we learn about God.

00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:04.019
There's some things that we learn about God's grace

00:46:04.019 --> 00:46:08.699
and about God's power, about God's purpose

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.099
through the times of affliction,

00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:11.739
through the times of difficulty.

00:46:11.739 --> 00:46:13.939
And Paul says, it's just light affliction,

00:46:13.939 --> 00:46:15.059
it's just for a moment.

00:46:15.059 --> 00:46:17.739
Then notice what he says, because he understands

00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:21.419
that God is working to accomplish something great.

00:46:21.419 --> 00:46:23.059
He's working to accomplish something

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:25.019
that would bring glory to his name.

00:46:25.019 --> 00:46:27.619
Notice in verse number 17, he says,

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:29.939
for our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

00:46:29.939 --> 00:46:34.659
worketh for us a far more exceeding

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:38.099
and eternal weight of glory.

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:44.099
Paul, beaten, stoned, shipwrecked.

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:46.099
Oh, God's working.

00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:48.459
He's working something good.

00:46:48.459 --> 00:46:49.699
He's working something great.

00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:51.579
He's working something for his glory.

00:46:51.579 --> 00:46:54.619
He's helping me to be conformed to his image.

00:46:54.619 --> 00:46:58.539
It's wonderful, but it's all based on perspective.

00:46:58.539 --> 00:47:01.179
Sometimes we get the wrong perspective in life.

00:47:01.179 --> 00:47:04.379
Seriously, we just got a temporal focus.

00:47:04.379 --> 00:47:07.459
We're just looking at things that don't really matter

00:47:07.459 --> 00:47:09.539
in the big scheme of things.

00:47:09.539 --> 00:47:12.499
There are eight billion people on this earth.

00:47:12.499 --> 00:47:14.939
It's estimated that somewhere around six billion of them

00:47:14.939 --> 00:47:17.939
are going to go to hell, the lake of fire.

00:47:20.339 --> 00:47:21.259
Yeah?

00:47:21.259 --> 00:47:22.459
I think that's low.

00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:24.499
I think it's low.

00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:26.779
I think it's more than that.

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:30.659
Multiple billions of people have never heard

00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:32.099
the name of Jesus Christ.

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:37.099
And we want a church in Corinth.

00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:40.219
I'm of Paul.

00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:42.259
I'm of Cephas.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:46.779
I'm of, have these divisions and these, seriously?

00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:48.979
Seriously?

00:47:50.299 --> 00:47:53.259
Paul says we got to get our perspective on heaven.

00:47:53.259 --> 00:47:55.579
We got to get our perspective on eternity.

00:47:55.579 --> 00:47:57.259
Every individual in Corinth,

00:47:57.259 --> 00:47:59.819
every individual here this morning,

00:47:59.859 --> 00:48:01.659
we're going to experience hardships.

00:48:02.659 --> 00:48:03.619
We're going to experience hardships.

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:07.459
We're going to experience the pressures in life.

00:48:07.459 --> 00:48:10.099
But through the hardships, the Lord is our helper.

00:48:10.099 --> 00:48:13.619
His provision, His grace, and His power is enough.

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:15.259
It's enough.

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.899
We find, it's wonderful.

00:48:16.899 --> 00:48:19.899
I turn over here to the book of 1 Peter,

00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:21.459
in chapter number five.

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:27.859
In verse number eight, I'll read verse seven with it.

00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:29.059
I wasn't planning to go here,

00:48:29.379 --> 00:48:31.739
but it says, casting all your care upon Him,

00:48:31.739 --> 00:48:33.859
for He careth for you.

00:48:33.859 --> 00:48:36.419
And then it tells us in verse eight, be sober, be vigilant,

00:48:36.419 --> 00:48:38.219
because your adversary, the devil, is a roaring lion,

00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:40.419
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:41.539
And then verse nine says,

00:48:41.539 --> 00:48:44.739
whom resist steadfast in the faith,

00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:49.339
knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished

00:48:49.339 --> 00:48:51.259
in your brethren that are in the world,

00:48:51.259 --> 00:48:53.939
but the God of all grace,

00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:58.579
who hath called us unto eternal glory by Christ Jesus,

00:48:58.579 --> 00:49:01.939
after that ye have suffered a while.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.779
I don't know how long a while is, and neither do you.

00:49:03.779 --> 00:49:05.859
You can look in any language you want to look in.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.059
It is an unspecified period of time.

00:49:08.939 --> 00:49:10.379
You can be the greatest Greek scholar

00:49:10.379 --> 00:49:12.219
there's ever been to walk upon the face of the earth,

00:49:12.219 --> 00:49:15.019
and a little while means a little while.

00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:16.619
It's unspecified.

00:49:16.619 --> 00:49:17.459
I don't know how long it is,

00:49:17.459 --> 00:49:18.659
but you know what I do know?

00:49:18.659 --> 00:49:20.459
God does.

00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:23.259
God does, and I also know this, it's not forever.

00:49:24.259 --> 00:49:25.779
It's not forever.

00:49:25.779 --> 00:49:29.099
And he says this, make you perfect,

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:34.099
establish, strengthen, settle you to him,

00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:39.819
be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:42.939
Listen, we need to allow the truth of God's word

00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:48.059
to benefit our lives.

00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:52.819
Allow his plan to change our perspective,

00:49:53.659 --> 00:49:56.379
because the pressures are gonna come.

00:49:56.379 --> 00:49:58.339
The provision will be there.

00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:00.179
God will give it.

00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:07.619
But your perspective and my perspective play a huge role in this thing. Play a huge role

00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:12.939
in this thing this morning. Oh, that we'd get our eyes on glory, get our eyes on heaven,

00:50:12.939 --> 00:50:17.419
on eternity. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your

00:50:17.419 --> 00:50:24.959
word, the truth contained therein. God, I pray this morning that you would help us.

00:50:24.959 --> 00:50:31.979
I don't know all of the pressures that your people are facing today. I don't know of the

00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:39.779
pressures that have mounted, maybe that have caused some to be discouraged and depressed.

00:50:39.779 --> 00:50:44.339
They've not experienced your provision. God, today would you help them to experience the

00:50:44.339 --> 00:50:49.819
provision that you've given to them, your grace and your power. If we faint in the day

00:50:49.819 --> 00:50:56.459
of adversity, our strength is small. It's not talking of physical, it's spiritual. God,

00:50:56.459 --> 00:51:04.299
help us to be strengthened in the inner man day by day. Help us to have this proper perspective

00:51:04.299 --> 00:51:16.859
of eternity. Oh, God, help us to not focus on the temporal things, but to focus on the

00:51:16.859 --> 00:51:22.499
eternal things. Would you use us for your honor and for your glory? Would you move and work? Holy

00:51:22.499 --> 00:51:28.219
Spirit, have your will and your way. Well, thank you for every decision that's made. For it's in

00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:32.619
Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's

00:51:32.619 --> 00:51:35.499
going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
