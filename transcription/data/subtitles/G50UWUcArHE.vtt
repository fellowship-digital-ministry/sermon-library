00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
text this morning, 2 Corinthians chapter number five.

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.719
We'll be looking at verses 14 through 21, 2 Corinthians five

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.560
verses 14 through 21.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.260
When you found your place there in 2 Corinthians five,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.220
I'd like for you to hold your place there

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.379
and also turn to the book of Acts and the ninth chapter.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.639
As we think about the passage of Scripture that is before us

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:23.299
and we find the Apostle Paul is writing to the church in Corinth

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:25.219
and we understand that Paul

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.020
was used of the Lord to write much of the New Testament.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.459
I'm so thankful the Bible tells us

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.880
that the word of God is given by inspiration for all.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.599
And we understand that truth.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.380
We also understand that the Bible tells us

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.939
And so we find that God used human penman and the Apostle

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:51.319
Paul is used to write this letter to the church in Corinth.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.939
Of course, he wrote the first letter that bears that name,

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.619
first Corinthians, and then here in second Corinthians.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.680
And we come to the fifth chapter.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.299
We're looking at verses 14 through 21 this morning.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.599
The Bible says this for the love of Christ constraineth us

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.139
because we thus judge that if one died for all,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.779
then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:19.480
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.580
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.319
Wherefore, henceforth, no, we no man after the flesh.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.239
Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.620
yet now henceforth, no, we him no more.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.819
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.819
Old things are passed away.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.940
Behold, all things are become new

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.120
and all things are of God who hath reconciled us

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.239
to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.739
the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.500
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.680
upon unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.100
Now, then we are ambassadors for Christ

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.020
as though God did beseech you by us.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.880
We pray you in Christ's stead.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.020
Be ye reconciled to God,

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:28.279
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:33.500
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.699
I'd like to preach a message that I've entitled this morning.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.460
Be ye reconciled to God.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.699
You see, that is the last phrase of verse number 20.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.600
Be ye reconciled to God.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.860
If you trace the steps of the Apostle Paul, you find there in the passage

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.199
where I asked you to hold your spot in Acts nine.

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.240
You have the opportunity to read of his conversion

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.399
in that passage of Scripture.

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.740
Of course, we first find the man Saul at the end of Acts

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.039
chapter number seven at the stoning of Stephen.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.119
When the Bible tells us that they laid down his garments

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.419
there at someone's feet, whose feet the one was Saul,

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.220
he was consenting unto his death, according to chapter eight and verse

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.020
number one.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.479
And at that time was a great persecution against the church.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.059
And you find that Saul made havoc of the church,

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.940
according to Acts eight and verse number three.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.360
But in Acts chapter nine, we find that Saul had those letters

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.119
that he had desired and he was going to Damascus to the synagogues.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:42.039
The Bible tells us that he was going to see if he found any of this way,

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.839
whether they were men or women, that he might bring them bound

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.720
unto Jerusalem.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.679
But he was on the way to Damascus, and suddenly the Bible tells us

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.720
that there shined round about him a light from heaven.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.639
We find that Saul, as he is there on the road to Damascus,

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.479
he's going with the intent of taking and binding these Christians

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.220
and bringing them back to Jerusalem and imprisoning them.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.520
And we find here that Saul is asked this question as he hears this voice,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.320
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.600
And Saul responds with this wonderful question,

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.239
who art thou, Lord?

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:32.079
And we find that Jesus replies and he says, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:34.779
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:38.799
So we find that the Holy Spirit of God had been working in conviction

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:44.380
in the life of this man, Saul, and his response to this conviction

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.679
was to intensify his persecution and to go with greater zeal.

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.899
He made havoc of the church, as I mentioned already.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:56.559
And it would just be as the one would use those prods

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.980
to the pricks to prod the livestock.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.980
He said it's hard for the kid to kick against the pricks.

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:08.519
And we find that Saul responds and says, Lord, what will thou have me to do?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.359
And it's interesting that you find that the answer that Jesus gives

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:18.119
is to arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:22.420
And we find that the Lord gave Ananias the privilege,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.959
the ministry of going to Saul and to giving him some instruction.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:33.079
And it's interesting that we find the Bible tells us in verse number 20 of Acts nine

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:40.339
and straightway he, speaking of Saul, preached Christ in the synagogues

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.299
that he is the son of God.

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.480
Why do I use this passage of Scripture in Acts chapter number nine

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.399
as we're studying 2nd Corinthians chapter number five this morning?

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:55.980
Because I want you to understand the testimony of the life of the apostle Paul.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.920
I want you to understand that in Acts chapter nine, his conversion is recorded

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.640
and I believe that as you continue to trace the steps of Paul through the book of Acts,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.100
I believe that as you read the letters that God allowed him to write to the churches

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.239
and that which is contained within our New Testament,

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:18.359
I believe that you will find that in the life of this one Paul

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:22.619
that he regularly rejoiced in his salvation.

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:28.600
He never got over the fact that he was saved by the grace of God.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.480
He understood that he had been redeemed.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.600
He understood that he was reconciled to God.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.059
And we find that Paul never got over it.

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:38.640
He rejoiced greatly.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.559
We find that on many occasions as you read through the book of Acts

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:46.480
that Paul took the opportunity to share his personal salvation testimony

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.700
and to speak of his conversion and all that Christ did for him.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.739
And I wonder this morning,

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:57.059
that as we look at the example of Paul

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:00.140
and we begin to dig into this passage of Scripture

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.600
that is before us in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.619
and we find that Paul understood the miracle of salvation

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:11.980
and the privilege that he had to know the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:18.220
I wonder this morning if we live every day with an appreciation of our salvation.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.179
I wonder this morning, when you woke up this morning at some time during your devotions,

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:26.399
if you thank the Lord for your salvation.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.739
God, I just want to thank you that I'm saved.

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:34.899
I thank God for my family, but I thank God for their salvation.

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:39.779
Not just for who they are individually and what they do and that sort of thing,

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.619
but I'm thankful to God on a daily basis that they're saved.

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:46.660
That they know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:52.899
I thank God for my salvation, and I don't ever want to get over the fact that He saved me.

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:56.980
I don't ever want it to just become commonplace.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.600
Oh yeah, I'm saved. Oh yeah.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.019
No, no, no. I hope that we would understand

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:05.399
and as we would have and be mindful of the price that was paid

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:09.399
by the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary for my sin,

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:15.540
that it would have me regularly appreciate my salvation.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.119
We sing a song, Hallelujah, What a Savior.

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:25.420
It's a great song, and we find that often as we think about our salvation

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.299
that we would conclude with that very statement, Hallelujah, What a Savior.

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:32.099
We have a wonderful Savior.

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:34.979
And I'm so thankful this morning for my salvation.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:38.059
And as we think about this truth, be reconciled to God,

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:43.020
it might be important for us to give a definition of what it means to be reconciled

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.640
or what the truth of reconciliation is.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.479
And really it carries with it the idea of a return to favor with someone.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.320
In the biblical context and what we're dealing with this morning,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.780
you find that it says, be reconciled to God.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.400
And so we find that the someone is God Almighty.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.119
That's who we're to be reconciled to.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.500
We'll get into the reason that we need to be reconciled here in just a moment.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.340
We find that another definition that is given of reconciliation

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:15.200
is the restoration of the favor of God to sinners

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:23.419
that repent and put their trust in the substitutionary death of Christ.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:27.340
Be ye reconciled to God.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.559
And some of you might be watching online and say,

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:32.020
well, I've already been saved, I've been reconciled.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.179
Well, hold on and stay with me through the entirety of the message this morning

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:39.559
because that's a good thing and that's a wonderful thing,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.799
but there's an important impact of our reconciliation

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:48.039
that we'll get to at the end of the message this morning.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.500
If you're taking notes, be reconciled to God.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.960
Notice number one with me, the miracle of reconciliation.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.260
The miracle of reconciliation.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.059
See, there's a problem and the problem is called sin.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.099
I got a text message from a preacher last night. He's a

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:06.439
pastor that has retired and he

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:13.039
Travels and he seeks to come to churches and not really in the capacity of an evangelist though

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:16.459
He does do some evangelist type ministry

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:20.379
But he just seeks to come alongside churches and just encourage them

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:25.459
He and his wife stopped by our church about three or four years ago, and they called us and said hey

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.939
We're gonna be in your area on a Tuesday night

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:30.259
I believe it was and I know that you don't have service

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:32.939
But but we'd like to just take you and your family out to dinner

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:35.359
We just want to be a blessing and encouragement to you

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:37.159
and he pastored for a number of years and

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:42.599
He just wants to be a blessing to pastors and what a blessing he is and he's added me to his list and he sends

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:48.519
Out a text every week and just seeking to encourage pastors and he said this in his text the question

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:51.759
What can wash away my sins is?

00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:56.759
Much more important than the question. What can wash away my germs?

00:10:56.759 --> 00:11:01.719
And I thought that was kind of interesting as we deal with all that we're dealing with this morning

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:07.680
in our world in this pandemic that's going on and the reality is that the

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:13.979
Blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can cleanse us of our sin. The Bible tells us

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:19.819
That or let me say this we sing that song what can wash away my sin?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.459
Nothing but the blood of Jesus and I'm so thankful for the blood of Christ when we think about the miracle of reconciliation

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:35.119
We find that there's a problem. We find that that there the problem is sin. This is a

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.799
problem that is

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:44.579
certainly affecting every human being this problem of sin and this results in being at

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:52.220
Enmity with God and we find that the Bible tells us notice in our passage of Scripture in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 5

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:57.360
He says this at the end of verse number 14 that if one died for all

00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.639
Then we're all dead

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:07.159
Obviously you speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ dying for all why because we were dead we were dead in our sins and our trespasses

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:09.520
We were dead spiritually

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.300
We had to be quickened being made alive through that process of regeneration

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:21.779
Being reconciled to God and we find here that he says in verse number 15 and that he died

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.779
For all aren't you thankful for that?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.660
For God so loved the world

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:33.500
But he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:38.739
We find that the question could be asked as we look at that truth in John chapter number 3

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.360
With regard to that verse of Scripture that so commonly understood

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.319
In verse number 16 and often quoted we find at the end of John chapter number 3

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:54.239
The Bible says in verse number 35 the father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hand

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:58.440
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:05.520
And he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:07.399
him

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:14.099
Paul says this that one died for all that's the Lord Jesus Christ his substitutionary death

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:19.940
Then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.080
Should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:31.279
We find the miracle of reconciliation. See there's a problem

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.819
The problem is sin notice what Paul says in Romans chapter number 5

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:41.979
That sin causes us to be at enmity with God and if we find that we're dead in our sins and our

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.779
trespasses in Romans chapter number 5 a wonderful passage of Scripture dealing with

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:50.520
Justification we find that the only way to be justified

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.279
To have peace with God is through our Lord Jesus Christ. It tells us that in Romans 5 in verse number 1

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.779
Therefore being justified by faith. We have peace with God

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.300
through our Lord Jesus Christ

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:14.179
Notice verse number 8 it says this but God commendeth his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners

00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:16.859
Christ died for us

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.019
much more than being now

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:28.220
Justified how by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.700
We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.820
much more being

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:41.619
Reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord

00:14:41.619 --> 00:14:43.619
Jesus Christ by whom we have now received

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:50.820
The atonement this is a miracle the miracle of reconciliation see the problem was sin

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:54.260
The fact that we were born sinners

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.540
We find that in verse number 12 of the same passage of Scripture that's before us in Romans 5

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.820
The Bible says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:05.660
We find that Paul is giving

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:13.139
Reference back to the event that is recorded in Genesis chapter number 3 when sin entered into the world in the Garden of Eden

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:14.660
with Adam and Eve

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.100
Taking of that forbidden fruit and the Bible says and death by sin

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:25.220
And so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned the miracle of reconciliation

00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:31.980
It starts with a problem the problem is sin, but then we see the provision the provision is that

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.660
substitutionary death of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:44.940
His precious blood was shed so that mankind could be redeemed and thus reconciled to God be brought back into that

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:46.940
to favor the

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:52.859
Restoration of favor see we're at enmity because of our sin, but Jesus Christ died on the cross of Calvary

00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:57.419
He was buried in a borrowed tomb. He rose in victory on the third day

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:04.339
Conquering sin death in the grave and as you trust the Lord Jesus Christ the finished work of Christ at Calvary

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:07.619
You're redeemed and thus reconciled to God

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:10.339
It's a wonderful truth of the Word of God

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.700
And we find that this truth of reconciliation notice

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:20.299
He says in verse number 17 of 2nd Corinthians 5 therefore if any man be in

00:16:20.859 --> 00:16:22.700
Christ

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.700
What is he he's a new creature?

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:29.019
Old things are passed away behold all things are become new

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:34.339
And all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.820
by Jesus Christ

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.100
The only way to be reconciled to God is through the atonement of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
There's no other way to have reconciliation

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.500
There's no other way for that

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.940
That enmity that division that separation that exists because of our sin

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.380
There's no other way for reconciliation to happen except for the fact that Jesus Christ

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:58.540
Took your place and took my place on the cross of Calvary

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:03.859
Thus making reconciliation possible thus we find the miracle of reconciliation

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.260
Turn back with me if you will to the book of Daniel

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.419
I know that we spent the last couple of weeks on Sunday morning in the book of Daniel

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:17.019
I had mentioned to you that we might finish up chapter number two this morning last Sunday

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:22.619
In fact, we'll do that in two more weeks and we'll look at the remaining portion of Daniel chapter number two

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.619
but this morning I want you to look at Daniel chapter number nine, I

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.619
referenced this portion of Scripture

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:33.359
Last Sunday evening as we dealt with the passage there in Jeremiah

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.359
when the Bible spoke about the importance of

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.440
Acknowledged thine iniquity and we find here in Daniel chapter 9 the prayer of Daniel after he understood

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.480
The years and dates and what have you there's a prophecy that is recorded at the end of the book of Daniel really beginning in

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.679
Verse number 20 down through the end of verse number 27 that prophecy helps us to understand

00:17:56.239 --> 00:18:02.880
Much of what's taking place during the tribulation and all of those things and we're not getting into all of that this morning

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.799
But I want you to notice something that is given to us here in Daniel chapter number 9 notice in verse number 24

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600
The Bible says this

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.040
70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:21.639
And to make an end of sins notice this and to make

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.720
reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.359
Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.900
So we find that 70 weeks we speak about the 70 weeks. We have often dealt with that

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:42.119
We find that there's a gap between week number 69 and week number 70 in prophecy

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:48.719
And we find that that 70th week is the week of tribulation again not to get into all of the prophecy this morning

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:54.760
But I want you to understand that he speaks about these 70 weeks and some of that which he says that's going to take place

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.799
Is that to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make?

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.760
Reconciliation for iniquity notice verse number 26 the Bible says and after three score and two weeks shall Messiah

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:09.960
be cut off

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.979
but not for himself and the people of the Prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:20.799
Sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:25.279
But notice the first portion of verse number 26 and after three score and two weeks shall

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.239
Messiah be cut off but not for himself

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:36.299
We find in this verse of Scripture this prophecy that's given to Daniel that it would be after

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:41.719
that period of time of three score and two weeks that Messiah would be cut off and

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.640
Dealing with the fact of his crucifixion

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:47.599
Notice this is but not for himself

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.640
See it was a substitutionary

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:56.380
Atonement we understand that the truth that we find in the Word of God remember

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.140
That Paul says in this passage that we're studying in 2nd Corinthians

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.360
chapter number five this morning, that He died for all. See, He died for us and we

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.800
find that we understand in the book of 1st Peter that the Bible tells us that

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.040
Jesus died, that it was for Christ also in 1st Peter 3 and verse number 18,

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:24.040
also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. Remember in 2nd

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.940
Corinthians 5 and verse number 21, for He, speaking of God, hath made Him, speaking

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:35.340
of Jesus, to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.380
righteousness of God in Him. And so you find that He says after three score and

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.580
two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for Himself. And we find this

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.380
substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus Christ, the miracle of reconciliation.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.740
Remember I told you that Paul was the one that as he went out and he began to

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.820
preach after his conversion, that he would go and he would preach Christ in

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:04.260
the synagogues and he would say that He is the Son of God, that He is the Messiah.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.500
You find that this was his manner throughout his ministry, that you would

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.820
find that he would speak about Jesus and many of those in that day knew who that

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.860
person Jesus was. They understood his ministry, they were aware of his

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:25.900
crucifixion, but he would preach to them and he would say this, specifically I'll

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.860
reference one of the passages here in Acts 17 in verse number 3,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.260
opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:43.260
the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ. See, Jesus, He

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:50.340
is God incarnate, right? Jehovah is salvation is what the name means. Christ

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.860
is the Messiah, the Son of God, the Anointed One. And we find that throughout

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:01.780
the Scriptures, that as we look at Paul preaching, he says this Jesus is the

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:07.980
Christ. Remember when the truth was given to Mary with regard to the

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.620
announcement of the birth of Christ, it says that you shall call His name Jesus.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:21.900
Why? For He shall save His people from their sins. We find in Daniel 9 that

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.620
prophecy of Messiah being cut off not for Himself. Notice in Hebrews chapter

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.160
number 2, we studied this several weeks ago, but I want you to look at two

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.900
verses of Scripture in the book of Hebrews and see the fulfillment of this

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.660
prophecy and see this understanding really of the miracle of reconciliation.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.860
See, this morning, the miracle that is before us as we consider that which God

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:51.100
has done in our lives for saving our souls that we now are reconciled to God,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.540
it's a miracle. In Hebrews 2, in verse number 17, it says, wherefore in all

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.540
things that behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren. Notice this, that He

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.260
might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:14.700
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. But how does He do that? Well,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.100
we know Hebrews 9 in verse number 22, though you won't see the word

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.420
reconciliation there, you find the by or reconciled or any form of the word, but

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.060
you find in Hebrews 9 in verse 22, it says, and almost all things are by the

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:34.980
law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission. And we

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:42.820
find this miracle of reconciliation. See, Paul, as he's writing to the believers in

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.460
Corinth, and he comes to this section that we're studying this morning in

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.540
2 Corinthians chapter number 5, he's speaking about this miracle of

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.340
reconciliation. Consider how he says in verse number 17, therefore if

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:02.300
any man be in Christ, that's being saved, being born again, understanding that

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.620
there's only one way to be saved, and that's through the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.700
It says, He is a new creature. Old things are passed away, behold all things are

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.780
become new. You see that in the life of the Apostle Paul, don't you? We read the

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.740
portion in Acts 9 at his conversion. He's going out and he's seeking to

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.980
persecute, he's making havoc of the church, and then he's saved and he begins

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:33.900
to preach Christ. There's a change in his life. There is a miracle that had

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:39.260
taken place. It's the miracle of the new birth, the miracle of reconciliation. Let

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.460
me share with you one other passage of Scripture in the book of Ephesians, if

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.100
you will. Turn over there and look at a few verses of Scripture in Ephesians

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.460
chapter number 2, and find here how the Apostle Paul deals with the subject of

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.540
reconciliation to the believers in Ephesus. Remember, if any man be in Christ

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.020
and we find that in the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians that

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.340
the Apostle Paul is dealing with the fact that you are in Christ, your

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.860
position. Remember, as we studied the book of Genesis and we dealt with the flood

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.060
of Noah's day, and we spoke about the importance of being in the ark. See, if

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.620
you were outside of the ark, you were destroyed. You had to be in the ark. That

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.300
was the place of refuge, the place of safety. We find that it was only Noah, his

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.380
wife, his three sons, and their wives, and of course the animals, but we find that

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:32.300
the only eight human beings were saved. Why? Because they were in the ark, and we

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.060
need to be in Christ. We need to be saved this morning. We find in Ephesians 2, in

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:45.060
verse number 12, it says this, that at that time you are without Christ, being

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.300
aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:54.260
promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. See, that's

00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.460
before salvation. That's the condition of all people prior to coming to Christ. We

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.020
understand, if you were to read the first few verses of the second

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.580
chapter of the book of Ephesians, how that Paul has already laid that truth,

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:13.540
that this is a universal condition for all mankind, that we are at enmity with

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.780
God. We are separated from God. We are without God in the world, but notice

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:28.380
verse 13, but now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:34.580
by the blood of Christ, for he is our peace, who hath made both one and hath

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.980
broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.860
the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:52.100
himself of twain one new man, so making peace. Notice verse 16 of Ephesians 2, and

00:26:52.100 --> 00:27:00.300
that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:06.620
enmity thereby. Remember, we speak about the miracle of reconciliation. We spoke

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:12.060
about the problem. It's sin. It causes us to be at enmity with God. What can wash

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:18.700
away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Your works are not sufficient. The

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.820
Bible tells us, in fact, in this same passage of Scripture, for by grace are

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.740
you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.540
works, lest any man should boast. There are people that today, I've had

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.100
opportunity to speak to people throughout the years, and often as I've

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.660
asked some, how is it, are you sure this morning or this evening or whatever time

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.140
of day it is, that if you were to die today, that heaven would be your home? I

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:55.100
hope so, I think so, maybe. Some that would reply with, yes, I've been saved. My sins

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.420
have been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. But most of those that would

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.140
answer with the uncertainty, if I were to ask them what it was that they were

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:09.260
trusting in, no doubt they say my works. I'm trying to be a good person. I'm doing

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.940
the best I can. In that song that Juliana and Brianna sang this morning, part of

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.140
that song referenced the truth in the book of Isaiah, that all of our good

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:26.900
works are as filthy rags. There's nothing that you can do to earn your way to

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.460
heaven. Jesus paid it all. Notice as you look through the verses that we've

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.980
already referenced this morning, when we think about the miracle of reconciliation,

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:42.619
it's that Jesus, God in flesh, that he took my place, that he took your place,

00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:50.420
that he paid it all. It's a miracle that the God of the universe took my place on

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:57.739
the cross of Calvary and said, it is finished. I've paid for your sin. Isn't

00:28:57.739 --> 00:29:02.980
that a miracle? It's a wonderful, wonderful miracle. And this morning, those

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:08.940
that have been reconciled to God, you say I've been saved, I'm so thankful, and I

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.780
hope that you recognize the miracle of reconciliation. This morning, if you've

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.140
never been saved, you do not have that assurance of heaven being your home. If

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.619
you were to die today, there's a level of uncertainty as to what would happen. Can

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:27.900
I tell you that Jesus died for you, that he was buried, and he rose again, and he

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:33.460
paid for your sin, and you trust him as your personal Savior and receive the

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.540
gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, and be

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:43.780
reconciled to God. For those of us that have been reconciled to God, I want you

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.980
to understand that not only did Paul have this truth and have this

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.540
understanding concerning the miracle of reconciliation, but he also understood

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:58.140
if you're taking notes number two this morning, the ministry of reconciliation.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.059
There's the miracle...

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:03.399
of reconciliation,

00:30:03.399 --> 00:30:06.399
but then there's the ministry of reconciliation.

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:08.559
Notice at the end of v. 18,

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.859
the Bible says this,

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:13.899
"...hath and hath given to us

00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:16.559
the ministry of reconciliation."

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.359
Who's us?

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:20.359
Those that have been reconciled.

00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:21.859
Those that have been redeemed.

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:23.859
He's speaking here about the fact

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:25.939
that God has given us

00:30:25.939 --> 00:30:28.939
this ministry of reconciliation

00:30:28.939 --> 00:30:31.059
so Paul had an understanding

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:33.319
of the miracle of reconciliation.

00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:34.939
What Christ did for him

00:30:34.939 --> 00:30:36.779
so that he could be saved.

00:30:36.779 --> 00:30:37.779
And he says,

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:39.699
based upon my understanding

00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:42.159
of the miracle of reconciliation,

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:44.079
I'm not going to live for myself.

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:47.579
I'm not going to live to meet my own desires

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.379
and to follow my own agenda.

00:30:49.379 --> 00:30:51.999
No, I'm going to live for Christ

00:30:51.999 --> 00:30:54.079
because He died for me and He rose again.

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:56.419
And my life, Lord, is Yours to control

00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:58.219
for me to live is Christ

00:30:58.219 --> 00:30:59.759
and to die is gain

00:30:59.799 --> 00:31:02.359
is what he says in the book of Philippians 1

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:03.499
and v. 21.

00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:06.039
And we find here that he understood the miracle,

00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:07.839
but he also understood the ministry.

00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:09.919
He understood that he had been entrusted

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:14.180
with the ministry of reconciliation this morning.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.299
If you've been redeemed,

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:17.180
if you've been reconciled to God,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.099
you're part of the us.

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:20.899
The ministry of reconciliation.

00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:23.599
It says, "...and hath given to us

00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:26.479
the ministry of reconciliation."

00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:28.479
We need to take this truth

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.199
of the ministry of reconciliation,

00:31:30.199 --> 00:31:31.879
we need to take it personally.

00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:33.759
We need to understand that we personally

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:36.500
are to be engaged in what he's dealing with here,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.180
this ministry of reconciliation.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.099
Notice in v. 19, to wit, he says this,

00:31:42.099 --> 00:31:44.059
as he's dealing with this truth

00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:46.099
of the ministry of reconciliation,

00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:49.360
he says that God was in Christ

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.819
reconciling the world unto Himself,

00:31:51.819 --> 00:31:54.360
not imputing their trespasses unto them.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.159
See, the sin and the iniquity

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.540
was poured upon Christ at His death on the cross.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.879
And it says here at the end of v. 19,

00:32:03.879 --> 00:32:07.000
"...and hath committed..."

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.339
There's that word again.

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:13.039
"...unto us the word of reconciliation."

00:32:13.039 --> 00:32:14.459
So we find in v. 18,

00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:15.580
"...he hath given to us

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.220
the ministry of reconciliation."

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.679
At the end of v. 19,

00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:20.720
"...that he hath committed unto us

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.339
the word of reconciliation."

00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:24.800
Remember what Jesus said

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.440
right before He would go to the cross of Calvary

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.899
as He's praying to His Father in John 17.

00:32:30.899 --> 00:32:32.860
And we find that He's praying there.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.239
And He says this,

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:35.819
"...sanctify them through Thy truth.

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:36.940
Thy word is truth."

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.360
But then He says in John 17,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360
in v. 18,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.259
"...as Thou hast sent Me into the world,

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:46.559
even so have I also sent them into the world."

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:47.979
What do you send us to do?

00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:49.380
To preach the Gospel.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.720
The ministry of reconciliation.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.839
Notice v. 20,

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:54.259
"...now then..."

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:55.759
Here's the understanding

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:58.259
as to what's been given to us.

00:32:58.259 --> 00:33:00.020
The ministry of reconciliation.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.559
The word of reconciliation.

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:02.300
He says,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.139
"...now then, we are ambassadors for Christ."

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:08.899
Isn't that a wonderful truth?

00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:10.360
That we're His ambassadors.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360
What's an ambassador?

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.440
It's a representative.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.860
One who goes on the behalf of another.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.899
Typically when we think about ambassadors,

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:19.279
we think about it in the context

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.720
of global, national things

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.179
where we have an ambassador

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:25.220
from the United States

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.020
to a particular country

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020
and what have you.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020
And what are they doing?

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020
They're in that country

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.940
representing on the behalf of

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.360
the country that they represent.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.020
And so they're in some other country

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.319
representing the country of their origin.

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:41.619
And we find here

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:43.819
that my citizenship is no longer

00:33:43.819 --> 00:33:45.459
here upon the earth.

00:33:45.459 --> 00:33:46.459
We sing a song,

00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:47.959
"...this world is not my home,

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:49.639
just a passing through.

00:33:49.639 --> 00:33:51.020
My treasures are laid up

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.639
somewhere beyond the blue."

00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:55.360
We find that there in the book of Philippians

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360
in the third chapter,

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.520
the Bible speaks about our citizenship

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.940
being in heaven.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.360
And what a joy that is.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.559
See, because we've experienced

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:05.360
the miracle of reconciliation,

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.819
but we understand

00:34:06.819 --> 00:34:09.039
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:10.899
Paul put it this way in Philippians 3

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:12.039
in verse number 20,

00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:15.239
"...for our conversation is in heaven.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.199
From whence also we look for the Savior,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.679
the Lord Jesus Christ."

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.959
What a blessing to know

00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:22.919
that my citizenship is in heaven.

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:24.559
That I'm a child of the King.

00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:26.119
This world is not my home.

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.519
I'm looking forward to the day

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:30.880
that I get to meet my Savior face to face.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.040
And forever and ever and ever

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.679
spend eternity with Him in heaven.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.040
What a blessing that is.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.119
That's the miracle of reconciliation.

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:42.239
But while we're here on earth,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.239
we're to be engaged

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.279
in the ministry of reconciliation.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.600
We are His ambassadors.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.320
Notice how he continues the verse

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.720
there in 2 Corinthians 5

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.919
in verse number 20,

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:57.239
as though God did beseech you by us.

00:34:57.239 --> 00:34:59.880
We pray you in Christ's stead,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.519
be ye reconciled to God.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:09.079
Notice, as we're engaged

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:11.200
in this ministry of reconciliation,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.279
that we're to go,

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:14.639
we understand that mankind

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:16.079
apart from Christ,

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:18.399
that they're without God.

00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:19.799
They have no hope in the world.

00:35:19.799 --> 00:35:21.079
They have no peace.

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:23.239
And the only way to have peace with God

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:26.160
is through the atonement of Jesus Christ

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.480
on the cross of Calvary.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.720
And only then can they be reconciled to God.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.519
It's interesting that in the preceding

00:35:33.519 --> 00:35:34.720
text of Scripture,

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.320
in verses 10-13 of 2 Corinthians 5,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.679
really Paul's dealing with

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.079
a completely different subject.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.679
That of the judgment seat of Christ

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:44.559
or the bema seat of Christ.

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.160
And we find that he makes

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.279
an interesting statement

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.799
in verse 11 of that text of Scripture

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:51.079
that I believe is pertinent

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:52.480
to our study this morning

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.919
with regard to the ministry

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:55.399
of reconciliation.

00:35:55.399 --> 00:35:57.320
He says, knowing therefore

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.919
the terror of the Lord,

00:36:00.919 --> 00:36:02.839
we persuade men.

00:36:02.839 --> 00:36:04.119
We persuade men,

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:05.639
but we remain manifest unto God

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:07.119
and I trust also remain manifest

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:08.239
in your conscience.

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:10.359
And I think about this truth there

00:36:10.359 --> 00:36:12.200
of 2 Corinthians 5

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.959
in verse 11

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.079
that we have an understanding,

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:18.559
we know therefore the terror of the Lord,

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:21.079
that we persuade men.

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:24.239
Have you ever read Revelation 20?

00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:25.919
You read in verses 11-15

00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:28.200
of the great white throne judgment.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.679
It will happen.

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:32.200
Listen, it's a sad thing

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.399
that people are dying from this COVID-19.

00:36:36.399 --> 00:36:39.399
We find that we're praying

00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:41.639
and we're asking God to work

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:46.079
and to have doctors with wisdom

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.880
with regard to how to treat patients

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.919
and all of those things.

00:36:48.919 --> 00:36:50.959
And you think about all of the efforts

00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:53.079
that are going forth in order to preserve,

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:54.320
to save life,

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.959
and we're applauding them

00:36:55.959 --> 00:36:57.600
and we're thankful for their efforts

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.000
and their attempts,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.480
but we understand that there is,

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.959
as of the point of end to man,

00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:04.440
wants to die.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.519
But after this, the judgment.

00:37:06.519 --> 00:37:08.200
You know that every day globally,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.600
150,000 people die.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.639
Every day, globally.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:15.119
That's about the number

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.959
as you look at it on an annual basis

00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:18.119
and you divide it out.

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:21.320
It's about 150,000 people every day

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.919
that die.

00:37:23.919 --> 00:37:25.480
And the reality is that

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.760
if they die apart from Christ,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.839
whether someone,

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:29.880
one of the things,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.119
let me back up and say this,

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:33.239
one of the truths that I've mentioned

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:34.959
during this entire pandemic

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.519
is that it's going to help people

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:40.040
to have an understanding of their mortality.

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.160
And as we think about people

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.880
having an understanding of their mortality,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.959
it gives us an opportunity

00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:48.320
to be able to speak to them about Christ.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.200
I said to someone not long ago,

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.440
you may die of COVID-19.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.200
You may not.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.559
You may never even be infected.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:59.040
You could be infected and you could die.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.600
But the certainty of the Scripture

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.079
is that one day you will die.

00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:09.880
Whether you die from this particular virus,

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.839
COVID-19,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.279
or you die from some other means,

00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:16.079
we find that death is certain.

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.720
We find that Solomon says this,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.760
there's a time to be born

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.600
and there's a time to die.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.679
And I'm not trying to minimize death.

00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:25.320
I'm simply saying that it's something

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.720
that we face.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.119
We face this thing of death

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:31.760
and there are many that have a fear of death.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.919
That's why we're called,

00:38:33.919 --> 00:38:36.559
as we've experienced the miracle of reconciliation,

00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:40.279
to be engaged in the ministry of reconciliation.

00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:41.359
That we would say to people,

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:45.359
be reconciled to God.

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.719
To quote, once again,

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:47.880
the text that I received

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.000
from the retired pastor last evening,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.840
the question,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.440
what can wash away my sins,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.200
is so much more important

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.440
than what can wash away my germs.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.359
Again, I'm not trying to diminish

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:02.919
or to dismiss the situation

00:39:02.919 --> 00:39:04.239
we're dealing with with COVID-19.

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:06.559
But can I tell you that for someone

00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:08.080
that experiences healing,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.000
for someone that never deals

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.520
with the exposure to this particular virus,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.279
they still have a problem.

00:39:15.279 --> 00:39:17.320
It's called sin.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.479
It is a universal condition

00:39:19.479 --> 00:39:21.840
that affects all mankind.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.919
And we find that as we would look

00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:25.479
at the passage of Scripture

00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:26.719
that is before us,

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:28.880
and many of you know that 2 Corinthians 5

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.279
and verse number 15 is my life verse,

00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:32.119
where the Bible says,

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:34.200
and that He died for all,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.159
that they which live

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:39.880
should not henceforth live unto themselves.

00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:42.279
But unto Him which died for them

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.159
and rose again.

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:46.320
And we find that the Apostle Paul,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.400
as we would look at this passage of Scripture,

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.080
I believe that the truths

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.559
that we find in this passage

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.919
that Paul was sharing

00:39:55.919 --> 00:39:57.960
of the miracle of reconciliation

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.960
and the ministry of reconciliation,

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.200
that these two truths result

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:09.120
Paul did, in the Apostle Paul saying, I'm living for Christ.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.280
As I've quoted already, Philippians 1 and verse 21, for me to live is Christ, and to

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.000
die is gain.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:26.400
See, I believe, as we trace the steps of Paul, that you see Paul recognized the miracle of

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.040
reconciliation.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.400
He never got over the fact that he was reconciled to God.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:39.240
And he understood what salvation was as he grew, and he understood this truth of, yes,

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.280
being redeemed and being justified, but being reconciled to God.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.800
That I was at enmity with God because of my sin, but now that relationship has been restored.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.620
I've been reconciled.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.080
It's a miracle.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.600
But not only did he recognize the miracle of reconciliation, I believe that Paul embraced

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.280
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.040
Why do we say that?

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.880
Traces steps.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.080
Everywhere he goes, he's preaching Christ.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:13.680
Everywhere he goes, he's calling people to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680
Savior.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:21.160
When he stood there before Agrippa, and Agrippa is there and he hears the message, and in

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:26.880
that particular passage of Scripture, we find that Paul, once again, shared his testimony

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:33.960
of what we looked at in Acts 9 of his conversion, and he shared for those that were there, Agrippa

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.840
in particular, that day in his life when he was saved.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:46.880
That Agrippa says, almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.200
And Paul said, I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day were

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.480
both almost and altogether such as I am, accept these bonds.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:04.400
We find that in Acts, that Paul often, excuse me, in the book of Romans, that Paul often

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.320
mentions his heart's desire.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.760
You find that he says in chapter 10, in verse number 1, brethren, my heart's desire and

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.000
prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.960
See, Paul embraced this ministry of reconciliation.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.320
After our first point, I kind of addressed those that maybe had never trusted the Lord

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.280
Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:37.120
They never personally experienced the miracle of the new birth, the miracle of reconciliation.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:46.520
But as we conclude this second point this morning, I'll speak to those that have experienced

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.600
the miracle of reconciliation.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:57.360
You recognize and rejoice in your salvation, what Christ did for you, and how that now

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.320
because of that, you now are reconciled to God.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:08.200
But my question for you is, are you embracing the ministry of reconciliation?

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.600
Are you embracing it?

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.720
Remember, he says in verse 18 of our text of Scripture, he hath given to us the ministry

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.040
of reconciliation.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.840
In verse 19, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.560
In verse number 20, we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:33.480
Again, in verse number 20, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.200
This morning, if you've never been saved, if you do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.440
your personal Savior, can I say to you, be reconciled to God.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.720
Recognize that you're a sinner, recognize that there's a penalty for sin.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.240
The Bible says the wage of sin is death.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.000
The wrath of God abideth upon you.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.520
You're at enmity with God because of your sin, and there's absolutely nothing that can

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.680
atone for your sin outside of the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.360
But he loved you so much that he died for you so that you could be redeemed, so that

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.680
you could be reconciled to God.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.240
You understand that you're a sinner.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.000
You understand there's a penalty.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.320
You understand that the price has been paid.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.800
The Lord Jesus Christ paid it all.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.880
The Bible says the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.440
Christ our Lord.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.640
If you had to work for it, it's not a gift.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.680
It's a gift because Jesus paid for it with his own precious blood.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.620
Would you this morning be reconciled to God?

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.520
Would you trust Christ as your personal Savior?

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.559
For those of us that have already been saved, we can look back and point on a time in our

00:44:42.559 --> 00:44:47.760
life, maybe a specific day in our lives, when we trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is our

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.360
personal Savior.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.240
We've experienced the miracle of reconciliation, but I wonder this morning, how are we doing

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.160
with embracing the ministry of reconciliation?

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.880
Understand that it's been entrusted to us that we have…what a privilege, by the way,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:10.720
to go and to speak to people and say, listen, the Lord Jesus Christ loved you so much that

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.640
he died for you.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.920
What a joy to be engaged in the ministry of reconciliation, and at this particular time

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.360
in our history, I believe that there's a greater awareness of the mortality of mankind.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.880
There is a level of fear.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:31.800
I mentioned this morning, a moment ago, how that many fear death, and one of the truths

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.200
of being reconciled is the truth that we find in Hebrews 2 and verse number 15, where

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:43.080
the Bible says, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.080
to bondage.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.200
See, I no longer have to fear death, why?

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.200
Because I've trusted the one who's conquered death.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.920
What a joy.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.559
This morning, be ye reconciled to God.

00:45:55.559 --> 00:45:59.880
The miracle of reconciliation, the ministry of reconciliation.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.720
Father, we love you.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.120
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.080
We thank you for the privilege of studying thy Word.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.000
We thank you for the truth that is contained therein.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.680
Father, we've been very specific this morning with regard to the passage of Scripture that

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.440
is before us, and Lord, I pray that if there's one that does not know you as their personal

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.300
Lord and Savior, that they would not allow another moment of time to pass before they

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:33.660
place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, understanding that

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:39.340
the only way to be reconciled to God is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.820
He paid for that sin, the sin of mankind.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.420
Lord, I pray for many believers that are watching, many of our church family that's watching

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.700
this morning.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:59.059
God, I think of my own life, and I pray, God, that you would help me, help us to embrace

00:46:59.059 --> 00:47:05.220
the ministry of reconciliation, that we would be good ambassadors, good representatives

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:10.100
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that we would go into a lost and dying world and

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:16.540
lift up the Lord Jesus Christ and preach, you must be born again.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:23.340
I pray that we do it with passion, with compassion, and with urgency.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.020
I pray that you'd have your will and way.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.260
Lord, as we have a moment of invitation here, I pray that those at home would spend some

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:39.420
time allowing you to speak to their hearts and search their hearts, Lord, help us to

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:45.140
allow you to have your way in our lives, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.340
We'll have a moment of invitation here.
