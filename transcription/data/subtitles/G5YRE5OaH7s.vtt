WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Chapter number five and very thankful for the opportunity

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.000
that we have in the middle of our week to gather together

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.600
and appreciate you being here this evening.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.680
And we're nearing the end of the fifth chapter

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.299
of the first letter written to the church at Thessalonica.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.200
We started in verse number 12, this is lesson number 14.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
And when we finish here in chapter number five,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.559
we'll go over to 2 Thessalonians chapter number three

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.920
and have an opportunity to study the instruction

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.120
that's given there.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.720
And this evening, we'll be looking at verse number 22

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.159
specifically, as I've mentioned often,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.479
the concise instruction provided to the church

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.740
at Thessalonica is to be learned and applied

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.279
by every New Testament church.

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:47.259
This information, this instruction that is given

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:49.119
to the church at Thessalonica,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.119
obviously they're the original recipients,

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.759
but God has preserved this letter

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.200
as part of the canon of scripture

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.639
and every New Testament church needs to learn

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.759
and apply these principles.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.959
The instruction must impact our behavior.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.279
I've said often throughout this study,

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:08.400
that as you look at these verses of scripture,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.260
you find that there's action, there's response,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.000
there's something for us to do.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760
And of course, as we study the Bible,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.959
we know that the greatest truth is that it must be applied.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.360
We're not just trying to get head knowledge,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
not just trying to answer some questions and what have you,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.879
but we wanna be able to apply.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.000
And when we apply these principles

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.959
and we live our lives following these principles,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.760
then we'll have the opportunity to please the Lord

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.400
and receive his blessings.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.519
This evening, as we look at verse number 22,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.879
we find that there's a principle that God gives us.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.279
I believe that this principle that is given to us

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.319
in verse number 22 is a principle that God intends

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.319
to guide our behavior, our associations, and our actions.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.000
You know, we find that the Bible clearly teaches

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.480
that God's people should not do evil.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.400
That's a known truth, amen?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.879
As you study through the scriptures,

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.600
and we're gonna get to verse 22 here in just a moment,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.399
but let me give you a number of verses.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.559
We're not gonna turn to all of them.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.160
I'm just gonna reference them

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.839
and I'm not even gonna turn to them.

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.059
I'm just gonna give you parts of the verses.

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.080
But in Deuteronomy 4 and verse 25,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.360
God says to his people, do no evil.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.800
That's pretty simple, isn't it?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.080
Do no evil.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.279
We find that in Deuteronomy chapter 13 in verse number five

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.559
and then seven more times in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.520
the Bible says that they are to, that God's people,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.800
they are to put evil away from among you.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.039
And so we find that God has given them that instruction

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.880
multiple times in the book of Deuteronomy

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.320
to not only do no evil, but to put evil away from among you.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.679
We find that he tells his people

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.199
that evil would befall them.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.039
Why?

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.000
Because ye will do evil.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.880
The consequences of doing evil is God's judgment.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.679
We see that in Deuteronomy 31 in verse 29.

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.860
We find that God is telling his people to do no evil,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.100
to put evil away from among you,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.839
but then he tells them that evil is going to befall you

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.119
because ye will do evil.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.800
God knows all things and he knew the behavior

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.520
of the children of Israel and what they would do

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.960
and the judgment that would therefore come

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.600
and therefore he pronounces that

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.119
even in Deuteronomy chapter 31.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.720
Seven times in the book of Judges,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.440
we read this statement that the children of Israel

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.720
did evil, seven times.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.479
And we find, obviously, really a theme

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.179
of the book of Judges is that every man did that

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.320
which was right in his own sight.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.520
There's no king in Israel in those days

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.279
and we find that people were doing whatever it was

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.119
that they wanted to do.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.600
There was a generation that outlived Joshua

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.440
and then there was a generation that went,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.119
they forsook the Lord.

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.039
They followed after all sorts of idols

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.639
and God allowed, because of their evil behavior,

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.679
he allowed for various people groups to rise up

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.759
and to bring opposition to them

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.040
and we find that God would graciously raise up a judge

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.160
and then they'd turn around

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.720
and after they'd have a period of peace and rest

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.559
from whatever that people were

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.480
that were bringing opposition,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.679
we find that they would then, once again, do evil.

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:31.279
In Isaiah 1 and verse 16, the prophet says,

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.839
cease to do evil.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.440
Why does he tell them cease to do evil?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.119
Well, because they were doing evil.

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:39.079
He wouldn't have to tell them to cease to do evil

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.019
if they were doing no evil,

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.399
but we find that they were disobedient

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.579
to so many other commands that have been given

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.600
and this is not an entire list of the commands

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.119
that God gives with regard to doing evil.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:52.320
You could look it up and I mean,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.799
there are just countless times

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:57.459
that God gives this instruction to his people,

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:02.399
but we find in Isaiah, he says, cease to do evil.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.399
We find it's also in the book of Isaiah.

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:08.440
Often we reference this where in Isaiah's day,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.440
they would call evil good and they would call good evil

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:17.040
and God brings an indictment against the nation of Israel

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:19.359
because of that and you understand

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:21.040
that it's never the culture, the society,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.779
it's never the individual that determines

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.279
what's good and what's evil.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.559
It is God and God alone who determines

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.079
what is good and what is evil.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.660
We find this evening that Jeremiah says this

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.640
of the children of Israel, Judah in particular,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.760
he says that they are wise to do evil.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.079
Now, that's not a commendation,

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:46.079
that's a condemning statement.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.959
He's not commending them that you are wise to do evil.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.519
No, we're not to be wise to do evil.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.119
We find that we're to do no evil.

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:57.480
In Isaiah 56 and verse two, the Bible says,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.359
blessed is the man that doeth this

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.600
and the son of man that layeth hold on it,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.799
that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.920
and then it says this and keepeth his hand

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.160
from doing any evil.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.519
Without going through a number of other scriptures,

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.640
we find that it's abundantly clear in God's word

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.079
that God's people are to do no evil.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.480
We're not to be people that do evil things.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.320
But we find that the New Testament principle

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.260
brings us to a higher plane.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.959
It's actually very interesting.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.279
If you read the Sermon on the Mount

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.720
in Matthew chapter number five,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.859
Jesus says you've heard, but I say unto you,

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:40.920
you've heard not to murder, but we're not to hate.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.559
He said you're not to commit adultery,

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.040
but if you think on a lady,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.440
you've already committed in your heart.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.359
He brings it to a whole nother plane of spiritual living.

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:54.000
And we find that yes, we would all agree

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.880
that God's people should not engage in evil behavior.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.000
They should not be doing evil,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.079
but we find that in the New Testament,

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:06.519
God's people are instructed to abstain

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:10.160
from the very appearance of evil.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.600
That's a whole nother level, it's a higher plane.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.040
And the reality is that we find that there are some

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.559
that would have and peddle these ideas today.

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:21.959
It's really nothing new.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.679
It's been going on since John wrote about it,

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:27.320
Paul wrote about it, it's been going on for centuries,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.920
but they would peddle this idea

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.220
that we're no longer under the law,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.480
so we can kind of just live however we want.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.640
But the reality is that I'm thankful

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.040
that we're not under the law, but grace is not a license.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.079
The liberty that we have in Christ

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.040
is not a license to do whatever we want.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.480
In fact, God calls us to a higher level of spirituality.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.839
He says to the children of Israel on repeated occasions,

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.559
do no evil, but he says to his church,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:01.119
abstain from the appearance of evil.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:04.359
You see it there in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 22.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.959
It's the title for the message this evening.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.399
Last week, we took a couple of verses.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:12.359
This week, we're looking at just one verse.

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.720
And very simply, he says,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.720
abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.959
Abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.540
As I look at this verse of scriptures,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.720
I think about this instruction that God gives

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.160
to the New Testament saints.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.760
We find that we must first determine what is evil.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.880
It's imperative that if we understand this instruction

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.760
that God is giving to his people,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.479
when God says abstain from all appearance of evil,

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.640
that we must recognize this evening

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.679
that it begins with making a determination of what is evil.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:52.239
Evil, according to the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary,

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:55.159
is having bad qualities of a moral kind.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:58.000
Wicked, corrupt, perverse, wrong.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.719
And he says as evil thoughts, deeds, or evil speaking.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.239
In fact, most of us, we know what is evil

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:08.840
and we know what is good.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.960
But the reality is that it's not for us

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.500
to be the judge of what is evil or what is good.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.719
We find that God has given us his word.

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:19.640
God is the only one who can define

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.840
and give to us the truth with regard

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.039
to what is evil and what is good.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.520
And as you search the scriptures,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.200
as you prove all things, as you determine,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.960
as you dig in, you find that God will help us

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.859
to be able to determine what is evil, what is good.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:39.559
We must analyze the word of God

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:43.719
in order for us to properly determine what is evil.

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:46.159
There was a great indictment that was brought

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.320
in the days of Ezekiel.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.599
In fact, turn there, if you will,

00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:51.280
and read with me Ezekiel chapter 22.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.380
The indictment that's brought against the nation

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:59.020
during this time in understanding what's taking place,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.859
we find.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:02.159
that there's great violations.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:05.459
In fact, if you were to read the entirety of chapter 22,

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:09.959
you will find that the judgment as a result

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.599
of the behavior that would come,

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:13.839
and there's an indictment against the prophets

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.039
and the priests and the princes,

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:17.619
and then eventually to the people.

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:19.559
And we're familiar with verse number 30

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:22.139
when the Bible says that God sought for a man,

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:23.479
but he found none.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:27.719
But I want you to look specifically here in Ezekiel 22,

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:29.899
and look at verse number 26 with me.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:31.659
The Bible says this,

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:35.119
her priests have violated my law.

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:35.959
Notice what it says,

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.279
and have profaned mine holy things.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.939
They have put no difference between the holy and profane,

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:45.399
neither have they showed difference

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:48.719
between the unclean and the clean,

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:50.999
and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths,

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:54.799
and I am profaned among them.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.439
We do not see the word evil,

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:59.159
but we understand in this verse of Scripture,

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:03.119
when the Bible says they have profaned my holy things,

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:04.199
mine holy things,

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:05.359
he talks about the difference

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:06.999
between the holy and the profane.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.039
He talks about the difference

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:10.039
between the clean and the unclean.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.759
But as we look at this verse of Scripture,

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:14.479
we find that what happens sometimes

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:18.799
is there begins to be a going astray,

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:22.879
a departure from God's word and from God's truth,

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:24.199
and then all of a sudden,

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:27.359
mankind begins to blur the line

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:29.399
on what is right and what is wrong,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.799
what is acceptable and what is unacceptable,

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.839
and we begin to live in this culture,

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.839
and I kind of gave hint to this

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:37.639
somewhat on Sunday morning,

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:39.759
where we allow the culture

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:42.839
to have a greater impact on the church

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:46.359
than what the church is having on the culture.

00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:49.919
The reality is we understand that God has always taught us,

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:53.039
we're the ones that are called to be the light.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:53.879
Amen?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.199
We're the ones that are called to shine in a dark world,

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:01.639
in a wicked and perverse generation.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.839
We are the ones that are called to be that light,

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.159
to stand forth and to stand up for righteousness,

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.399
understand that the biblical principle,

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.599
and I'm thankful that God gave it,

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.559
although he gave it in the Old Testament,

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:16.799
he does not speak it specifically

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:18.439
about the nation of Israel,

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:20.919
although it would be applied to the nation of Israel,

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.479
but we find that the Bible says

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:26.399
that sin is a reproach to any people,

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.679
but it says that righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:33.199
And there are people today that they don't understand.

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:37.079
So if we're going to take the principle that God gives us,

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:42.039
really this guiding principle that God has given us here

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:44.719
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 22,

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:48.439
this principle that God intends to guide our behavior,

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:50.879
our associations and our actions,

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:55.079
we must first be able to determine what is evil?

00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:55.999
What is evil?

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:00.759
Is it valid for you to have your definition of evil

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:02.879
and me to have my definition of evil

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.679
and for our neighbor to have their definition of evil

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:06.879
and the coworker?

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:10.199
No, the reality is that God has given to us

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:14.519
the standard by which we must apply in our lives.

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:17.399
Have you ever heard somebody say, well, my truth?

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.399
What do you mean your truth?

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.239
There's truth.

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:27.119
And we find this evening that we must begin

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:30.399
by being able to determine, define what is evil.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.319
We find that next we must understand

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:34.439
what it means to abstain.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.199
It's interesting, it means to forbear or to refrain,

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:39.639
but really the definition, the idea

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:42.719
is that it would be something that's done voluntarily

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:44.879
that we abstain from.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:48.039
See, it's not that somebody is restricting you

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:49.399
from doing something.

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:53.239
It's that we are abstaining on our own volition.

00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:55.279
And we find that it's through the power

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.119
of the Holy Spirit of God that that's only possible

00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:00.439
that we could abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:03.199
But we find that when it says abstain,

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:05.319
that that's something voluntary.

00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:08.399
We find that this evening God does not

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:12.759
force himself upon you or upon me.

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:15.119
He doesn't make us.

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:16.679
You can make a decision.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:19.599
I've said to people, they said, why don't you do this?

00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:20.439
Why don't you do that?

00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:22.079
I could do whatever I wanna do.

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.079
But is it gonna be pleasing to God?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.519
Amen, we have a free will.

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:31.679
But if we say I'm crucified with Christ,

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:34.279
we find out that we're to follow and take heed

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:36.559
to the commands that he's given us.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.479
And so we find that this word abstain

00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:40.639
meaning to forbear or to refrain,

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:44.599
but we find that it's a voluntary action that we take.

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:46.359
It's only again possible

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:48.079
through the power of the Holy Spirit.

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:50.159
It's only going to be possible in your life

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.479
and in my life to abstain

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:54.439
because we're walking in the Spirit.

00:14:54.439 --> 00:14:57.879
Because remember, the Bible says Galatians chapter number five

00:14:57.879 --> 00:14:59.159
that if we walk in the Spirit,

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:03.879
we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:06.639
I hope that you've understood since you've been saved.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:09.479
And I know that here tonight,

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:11.839
some of us have been saved for longer periods of time

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.319
and others for shorter periods of time.

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:16.239
And there's a wide spectrum amongst us

00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:18.679
as to how long we have been saved.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.359
But no matter how long you've been saved,

00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:23.239
I hope that this evening you have learned

00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:24.799
that just because you're saved,

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:28.519
it doesn't mean that you have no more fleshly lust.

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:30.479
Amen?

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:35.000
The flesh is at enmity with the Spirit.

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:39.439
Not only does God tell us that, but we understand that.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.799
We live that every day.

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:44.039
That's why He says that we're to be crucified with Christ.

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.959
That's why He says that we're to die daily.

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:48.319
That's why He says that we're to walk in the Spirit

00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:50.599
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.359
It'd be wonderful if there were no more lust of the flesh,

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:56.479
but the reality is that the flesh is still there.

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:59.799
It's not eradicated at the moment of salvation.

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:02.879
So we find that we're to abstain

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.559
and we must answer the question as we look here

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:07.639
and we've determined what is evil,

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:08.919
what does it mean to abstain?

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:12.399
But notice what it is that we're to abstain from.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.079
It says, abstain from all,

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:20.079
that's an important word, right?

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:23.799
Appearance of evil.

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:28.799
Abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.079
Now it's very interesting

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.399
because as we begin to look at the whole of Scripture

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:36.399
and as I've read so many verses to you already this evening,

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:39.759
we find that it's understood that we're to do no evil,

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:43.000
but now this higher plane of Christian living,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.799
this higher plane of spirituality,

00:16:45.799 --> 00:16:49.319
God says that we're to abstain from the very appearance,

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:52.799
from all appearance of evil.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:57.559
So after we have defined what is evil,

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.079
after we have gone and searched the Scriptures

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:03.599
to be able to adequately understand what is right

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:05.879
and what is wrong, what is evil

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.319
and what is righteous,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.479
we find that we understand we're to abstain

00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:12.839
from all appearance of evil,

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:17.559
we then must apply the principle in our lives.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:20.559
How do we apply this principle

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.359
that we find in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 22?

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:28.000
Just a simple verse of Scripture,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.879
just a handful of words.

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:33.879
I would encourage you to commit it to memory

00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:38.000
before engaging in any activity.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.439
We should examine said activity based on this principle

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:48.599
because the Bible says abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:17:49.199 --> 00:17:50.959
Why didn't it do anything?

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:55.279
It didn't say do no evil, amen?

00:17:55.279 --> 00:18:00.279
It says abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:03.319
It's a higher level.

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:07.239
You understand that we've been called to live holy lives.

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:10.359
The Bible tells us that God is holy

00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:12.039
and I'm thankful that he's holy,

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:14.199
but he says that we're to be holy

00:18:14.199 --> 00:18:17.959
and we're to live righteous, holy lives.

00:18:17.959 --> 00:18:19.239
In fact, hold your place here

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:21.639
and turn to the book of Titus if you will.

00:18:21.639 --> 00:18:24.919
And I want you to notice what the grace of God teaches us

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:29.919
based on what Paul reveals to Titus in the second chapter.

00:18:30.639 --> 00:18:34.760
Again, there's some that use grace inappropriately

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.760
in the day and age in which we're living.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.760
I'm thankful for grace, amazing grace, abundant grace.

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.599
The Bible tells us in Titus 2,

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:45.640
beginning in verse number 11,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.799
for the grace of God that bringeth salvation

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.159
hath appeared to all men.

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:52.919
Aren't you thankful for the grace of God?

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:54.559
Notice where it says teaching us.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.519
What's teaching us?

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:58.079
Well, the grace of God is teaching us

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:03.440
that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.599
we should live soberly, righteously,

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:10.599
and godly in this present world.

00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:17.359
Is it even possible in the wicked, evil world that we live

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:22.359
that we could live soberly, righteously, and godly?

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.519
Sure it is with God's help.

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:27.719
God is our helper.

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:31.279
We find that wonderful verse in verse 13,

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:35.079
looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:38.959
of the great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:40.119
He's coming again.

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:45.440
We find that the grace of God has taught us some things.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.039
It teaches us how to live in this wicked world.

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:52.440
We take this principle from 1 Thessalonians,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.760
and I think about a church in Thessalonica,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.039
and I think about the impact that the church,

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:00.039
the believers, understand the church.

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:03.159
It's not the building, it's the people.

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:06.399
The people of Thessalonica that are receiving this letter,

00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:08.239
they're to live in this world

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:11.159
and they're to be a light in their community.

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.879
In fact, the Bible tells us back

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.039
in 1 Thessalonians chapter number one,

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.079
that in verse number seven,

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:18.639
so that you were in samples

00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:21.679
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.999
He tells them in verse number nine,

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:25.399
for they themselves show of us

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:28.119
what manner of entering in we had unto you

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.359
and how you turn to God from idols

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:33.159
to serve the living and true God.

00:20:33.159 --> 00:20:34.739
In verse eight, it says that they didn't have

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:38.239
to speak anything because they were so busy

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:39.879
sharing the truth of the gospel

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:44.799
and being the influence in their community.

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.479
We find that as Paul gets to the end

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:49.319
of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:52.839
this is abstained from all appearance of evil.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.239
We're going out as the representatives

00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:58.479
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:02.999
We're going out as his ambassadors, as his witnesses,

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:04.639
or take a gospel message,

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:09.519
the wonderful glorious message of Jesus saves.

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.999
And he says that not only would the truth be

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:15.839
that we're to do no evil,

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:19.959
but we're to abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:25.639
So while we consider an activity,

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:29.679
an association, the actions that we might participate in,

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:34.679
as we begin to examine those things using this principle,

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:39.199
we must ask ourselves a couple of questions.

00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:42.439
Number one, I think we should ask ourselves this,

00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:47.439
will me being here or will me doing this thing

00:21:49.139 --> 00:21:52.659
adversely impact my testimony?

00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:57.999
Will me being in this place,

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:04.319
if I participate in this activity,

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:08.679
will it adversely impact my testimony?

00:22:09.879 --> 00:22:11.959
You know, it'd be a shameful thing

00:22:11.959 --> 00:22:15.119
for someone to come to you or to come to me

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.839
as we're engaged in some activity

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:18.919
and say something like this.

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:20.479
I thought you were a Christian.

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:23.199
Wouldn't that be a shameful thing?

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:28.199
You know, many times the world knows almost better

00:22:28.199 --> 00:22:30.159
than Christians know on the things

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:32.559
that we should and should not do.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.659
It's pretty shameful.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:38.079
I'd be embarrassed for someone to come to me

00:22:39.699 --> 00:22:41.639
and say, I thought you were a Christian.

00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:42.479
Why are you here?

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:43.319
Why are you doing this?

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:46.979
Why are you participating in this?

00:22:46.979 --> 00:22:48.679
Wouldn't that be a shameful thing?

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:52.799
So we must ask ourselves that question.

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:57.759
Would it bring a negative to my testimony,

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:59.359
to your testimony?

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:02.639
I think a second question that we must ask ourselves

00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:04.999
as we apply this principle in our lives

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:08.419
is not only would it adversely affect my own testimony,

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:12.639
but would it bring a reproach upon the name of Christ?

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:17.079
And quite honestly, that's the more important question.

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:21.359
Would it bring a reproach upon the name of Christ?

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:25.499
I'm thankful that we're his representatives.

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:27.679
But you know, as his representatives,

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.599
that's a high calling.

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:33.719
It's a great privilege to be his representatives.

00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:36.079
But as we go out and represent him,

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:38.759
we must represent him well.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:41.039
And we must understand that there's behavior.

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:43.579
Listen, there's times within the Old Testament,

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:45.799
David's an example, there's others as well,

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.939
that they gave an occasion to the enemy

00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:50.879
because of their behavior.

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:55.039
David specifically, with the circumstance

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.539
with Bathsheba and Uriah, and all that takes place there.

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.559
But we can look at a number of examples

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.439
and we can understand where it's said of,

00:24:02.439 --> 00:24:04.679
or we can understand as we study

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:06.039
and we see what's taken place,

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:09.439
how that the behavior, the actions

00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:13.879
of the children of Israel brought a reproach

00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:15.399
against the name of Christ.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:19.299
What do people think about our Jesus?

00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:22.839
That's a good question, isn't it?

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:27.839
You know, many times, I know someone said this years ago.

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.879
It was in a poem, I can't think of the name

00:24:29.879 --> 00:24:31.519
of the poet at this point.

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:34.239
It was a poem many years ago,

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.999
and the individual that was writing the poem said

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:39.919
that your life might be the only Bible

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:42.479
that a lost person might ever read.

00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:44.479
What they meant by that is some people

00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:48.919
might never actually pick up a Bible like this,

00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:53.919
but what they believe about God will be greatly impacted

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:58.679
by what they see and observe in us as God's people.

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:01.959
We're his representatives.

00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:05.279
And we find this evening that if we're going to take heed

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:07.119
to a principle that we find here,

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:11.039
abstain from all appearance of evil,

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:14.079
that it doesn't just say don't do evil,

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:18.039
it says that we're to abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:20.919
We sing a song with the kids.

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:23.799
It's actually quite fun to sing the song.

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:26.799
It's amazing, some of the songs that we sing

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:29.199
with children in Sunday school and vacation Bible school

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.639
that we stop singing as adults,

00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:33.459
but what great messages those songs have.

00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:38.759
The song goes like this, the things I used to do,

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.199
I don't do them anymore.

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:42.799
Why?

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.879
Because there's been a great change

00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:46.919
since I've been born again.

00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:48.679
And you could go on and on with that song

00:25:48.679 --> 00:25:51.719
and you could say the places I used to go,

00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:53.859
I don't go there anymore.

00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:54.699
Why?

00:25:54.699 --> 00:25:56.399
Because there's been a great change

00:25:56.399 --> 00:25:58.519
since I've been born again.

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:00.899
The things I used to watch, I don't watch them anymore.

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:03.439
The things I used to, I mean, you can just go on and on,

00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:06.559
you can have a lot of, it's a powerful truth.

00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:13.559
We find this evening that as we look at this principle,

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:15.759
this guiding principle,

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:20.759
abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:27.619
Heeding this principle reflects not only obedience,

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:28.679
reflects wisdom.

00:26:30.659 --> 00:26:34.159
You know, there's some places I'm just not gonna go.

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.079
Why?

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:38.159
Because I'm gonna abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:39.559
I'm just not gonna go there.

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.279
Does that make sense to you this evening?

00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:46.399
I don't wanna be seen at some place of ill report

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:47.279
of whatever it might be.

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:49.279
Listen, I said this to somebody years ago.

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.199
You can go, I have never been,

00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:54.079
on the record, I have never been to a bar.

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.919
Okay, but you can go to a bar, I believe,

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:58.119
and you can get a Coke.

00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:00.399
I don't really like Coke.

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:04.519
But could I tell you,

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:06.519
I'm not gonna go to a bar to get a Coke.

00:27:07.439 --> 00:27:08.279
Why?

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:10.459
Because I'm not gonna go to that place.

00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:15.219
Abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:16.059
Does that make sense?

00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:18.259
It's not just because I'm a pastor.

00:27:18.259 --> 00:27:20.339
It's because I'm a Christian.

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:22.459
It's because I'm a Christian.

00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:24.219
And we could go on and on this evening

00:27:24.219 --> 00:27:25.699
as we would seek to apply this,

00:27:25.699 --> 00:27:30.099
but I want you to really grasp this thought tonight.

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:35.299
When the Bible says abstain from all appearance of evil,

00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:37.939
it's a simple verse of Scripture,

00:27:37.939 --> 00:27:40.099
a verse that would, perhaps,

00:27:40.099 --> 00:27:42.259
for all of us this evening as we leave,

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:44.179
we could almost just have it committed to memory

00:27:44.179 --> 00:27:46.179
without even really working on it,

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:47.299
because it's not a hard verse.

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:49.339
Abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:53.519
But I would say for most,

00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:57.059
I'm not speaking just about the folks

00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:57.899
that are gathered here.

00:27:57.899 --> 00:28:00.339
I'm speaking of Christendom in general.

00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:05.339
Most behave on a daily basis

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:08.719
as if this verse of Scripture is not even in the Bible.

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:12.739
They don't give two thoughts about what,

00:28:12.739 --> 00:28:15.299
they don't even think about the appearance of evil,

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:17.339
and it's shameful.

00:28:18.339 --> 00:28:21.299
And this evening, I want you to consider

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:25.619
as we're called to live on a higher plane,

00:28:25.619 --> 00:28:28.499
and we think about this principle this evening,

00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:31.699
not only does it reflect obedience and wisdom,

00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:34.459
but I believe that this very principle,

00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:38.259
this guiding principle, when obeyed,

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:41.899
when applied, you know what it'll do?

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:44.259
It'll keep us from doing evil.

00:28:45.579 --> 00:28:46.820
You know why?

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.559
Because if I'm abstaining from all appearance of evil,

00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:55.419
it's gonna go a long way

00:28:55.419 --> 00:28:58.440
to keep me from doing evil.

00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:01.699
I'm sure I'm not the only one.

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:07.219
Although I probably get some things that you do not get,

00:29:07.219 --> 00:29:09.219
just because I'm a pastor

00:29:09.219 --> 00:29:12.139
and the church email gets some things,

00:29:12.139 --> 00:29:16.179
but I get things just about on a weekly basis

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:17.739
of church leaders.

00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:19.559
Now, I didn't say Baptist church leaders,

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:23.519
but church leaders, religious leaders

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:28.179
that have been found guilty of some crazy immoral behavior.

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:30.500
Do you not see that stuff in the news?

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.419
It's not just the church leaders.

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:35.940
Listen, it's being exposed to the church leaders.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.459
You understand why the enemy's trying

00:29:37.459 --> 00:29:38.739
to attack the church leaders,

00:29:38.739 --> 00:29:41.820
because then the whole thing can kind of just fall apart.

00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:45.239
But I'm telling you, I would be embarrassed.

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:48.099
I would be ashamed to speak of some things

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:51.539
that I have heard pastors share with pastors

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:53.859
of what do you do in this situation?

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:57.179
I've had couples come into my office and they have shared,

00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:58.979
and I don't even know what to say.

00:29:58.979 --> 00:30:09.299
you begin to talk about some of the immoral, wicked behavior of Christians.

00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:11.939
They're doing the evil.

00:30:11.939 --> 00:30:20.419
But here what God has called us to is abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:25.419
Does that cancel out the principles that we began with this evening, that we are to do

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:26.419
no evil?

00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:27.919
No, not at all.

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:35.879
But it goes a long way to helping us not do the evil this evening.

00:30:35.879 --> 00:30:42.159
The church at Thessalonica, every New Testament church, Fellowship Baptist Church, every child

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:49.959
of God, you and me and every other blood-washed, born-again, heaven-bound child of God needs

00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:59.599
to take the truth of 1 Thessalonians 5.22 and live it out, abstain from all appearance

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:01.159
of evil.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.039
What do you mean you can't go there?

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:06.639
What do you mean you can't do that?

00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:14.959
I'm choosing to obey God and I'm going to abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:31:14.959 --> 00:31:16.319
The pressures will come.

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:18.319
The pressures will mount.

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:20.959
Oh, it means you can't have fun?

00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:24.759
I said to somebody just a couple of weeks ago, you know the awesome thing is as Christians

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:28.999
we can have a whole lot of fun and we don't have to have any regrets about it.

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:30.319
Amen?

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:32.599
I'm serious.

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:39.239
I just got invited on Monday to go preach for a young adult activity at a church out

00:31:39.239 --> 00:31:40.239
in Harrisonburg.

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:42.359
They're going to have it on a Friday night.

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:46.919
He said, I just want to have like a bonfire, kind of play some games and have some preaching.

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:49.959
I just want to have fun with young people in our church.

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:51.959
That's what the pastor said to me.

00:31:51.959 --> 00:31:52.959
And then I want you to preach.

00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:55.439
I said, okay.

00:31:55.439 --> 00:32:01.439
But the thing, we can have fun and have no regrets.

00:32:01.439 --> 00:32:03.199
Abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:10.399
I think if we'd really take the truth and define as God does what is evil, we would

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:17.479
take the truth of what it means to abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:26.039
It would go a long way in shaping, influencing the decisions that we make, the associations,

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:29.879
the activities, our actions.

00:32:29.879 --> 00:32:36.799
Indeed, we are to do no evil, but tonight we've been called to live on a higher plane.

00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:43.679
God tells us, abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:44.679
Let's pray.

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:46.199
Father, we love You.

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:48.679
We thank You for loving us.

00:32:48.679 --> 00:33:04.199
God, the principle that's before us this evening, so practical, so helpful, so needed.

00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:17.319
God, I pray that we, as Your people, would take heed to this simple verse of instruction.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:27.199
God, before we engage in activities, before we participate with certain people at certain

00:33:27.199 --> 00:33:38.479
places, that we would answer the questions, we'd analyze whether doing that thing or

00:33:38.479 --> 00:33:46.319
going to that place would violate this principle.

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:52.199
Would it bring reproach in the name of our wonderful Savior?

00:33:52.199 --> 00:33:59.239
Would it adversely impact our testimony for Christ?

00:33:59.239 --> 00:34:08.559
God, I pray that tonight You'd help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:12.039
We thank You for the privilege of corporate prayer.

00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:16.719
We thank You that You've told us in Your Word that You hear and answer.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:27.479
God, we praise You for answers to prayer that we have received and how thankful we

00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:28.479
are.

00:34:28.479 --> 00:34:32.959
God, I pray that You would bless our prayer time tonight, that through all that's said

00:34:32.959 --> 00:34:38.479
and done that You'd be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:34:38.479 --> 00:34:39.119
Anyone need a prayer book?
