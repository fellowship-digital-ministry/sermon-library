1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,639
7. We'll be looking here at a familiar passage of Scripture and Matthew chapter 7 looking at verses

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,159
7 through 11. And as you have your Bible in turn there, I'll begin reading in verse number 7.

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:16,719
I'll read the entirety of the text and we'll get into the message this evening. Notice as the Lord

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:24,239
Jesus Christ is teaching, he says this, ask and it shall be given unto you. Seek and ye shall find.

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,799
Knock and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that

6
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:38,319
seeketh findeth. And to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you,

7
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:48,400
whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:59,040
serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more

9
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:07,599
shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Isn't that a wonderful

10
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:13,279
passage of Scripture? So rich. I'm thankful for the Bible. The subject of prayer is a familiar

11
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:19,199
and often discussed subject. However, I find and I think I've discovered both through experience

12
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:25,120
personally and also through counseling over the years that consistent prayer in the life of a

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,360
believer is challenging. And it seems as if one of the hardest disciplines in a Christian life

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,400
is consistent, fervent prayer. Someone asked me the question years ago as we were having a Timothy

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,639
Fellowship meeting. They said, what's more important, Bible reading or prayer? And I said,

16
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:47,199
yes, because you really can't put one as a priority over the other. But I will say to you,

17
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:52,239
and I've said it over the years from this pulpit, extremely transparent, it is a lot easier for me

18
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,879
to spend an hour reading God's Word than it is for me to spend an hour praying. It doesn't mean that

19
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't pray. I'm just simply saying to you it's easier for me to spend that hour reading than to

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,559
spend that hour praying. Someone asked this question. I read it this week in an article

21
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:14,240
that I was reading and looking through, and it asked this question. It said, sweet hour of prayer.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,880
And then it asked this, how long does it take you to have a sweet hour of prayer? Does it take you

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,199
a day? Does it take you a week? Does it take you a month? And I thought, wow, how convicting is that?

24
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:34,320
But the reality is that prayer is something that is spoken of throughout the Bible. We find that

25
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:41,039
in the Old Testament, there's wonderful references and records that God has provided to us with

26
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,320
men and women that prayed, that poured their heart out before God, that were fervent in prayer and

27
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,320
how God moved and how God worked. And we come to the New Testament, we begin to look at the

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,800
example of the Lord Jesus Christ, a man who often, we understand he's the God-man, but often during

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,160
his earthly ministry, he would go and he would go into a desert place. He would separate himself,

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,360
for what purpose? For prayer. We find that the disciples of John, according to the Scriptures,

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
he had taught them some things about prayer, and one of the disciples of Jesus says,

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,600
teach us to pray. Throughout the Bible, we have many promises that God has given to us, and

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
for a few minutes this evening, I want to look at this familiar text of Scripture. I've just simply

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:38,160
titled the message, Ask, Seek, and Knock. Ask, Seek, and Knock. As we dig into the passage in verse number

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,119
seven, number one, I want you to recognize the privilege. The Bible, as begins to speak here in

36
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:51,759
this passage with regard to prayer, the Bible says, ask, and it shall be given unto you, or given you.

37
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,160
Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you. We find that Jesus Christ, as he

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,600
begins teaching in this portion of his earthly ministry with regard to the subject of prayer,

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,320
we recognize immediately at the onset of this text that it's a privilege, and we must recognize the

40
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,160
privilege that God has given to us as his people to pray. In fact, back in chapter number six,

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,480
if you turn back a page, maybe it's on the same page for you, but we find that he's teaching on

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,760
prayer there as well, and we find that it's in that passage in Matthew 6 that he provides for

43
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,440
us that record of what we would refer to as the model prayer. In verse number five, the Bible says,

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,559
and when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in

45
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:41,279
the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you

46
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:48,079
that they have their reward, but thou, when thou prayest, you see how he says, when thou prayest,

47
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,920
as if it's expected that we would pray. Why? There's a privilege. He says, when thou prayest,

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,799
enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret,

49
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,839
and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But again, he says in verse number

50
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:10,959
seven, but when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they shall

51
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:17,440
be heard for their much speaking. You know, we sometimes, as Baptist people, we may criticize

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,959
some of maybe other denominations or religious backgrounds that have what we may refer to as

53
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,519
memorized prayers, rote religion, but you know what I found is that sometimes we too have memorized

54
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:36,559
prayers, rote religion. It can become very mundane. It can come very methodical. We can have in our

55
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:42,480
minds where it's just almost like an autopilot kind of thing, and the reality is that we find

56
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,760
that as we look at these passages of scripture in Matthew six and verse number seven and then

57
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,000
also in chapter seven and verse number seven, we see and we must recognize the privilege that God

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,480
has given to us to pray. We, of course, are familiar with many of the wonderful promises that God has

59
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,440
given with regard to prayer, but I find that even prior to the promise that we read in Jeremiah 33-3,

60
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,440
it starts out by saying, call unto me. Call unto me. This invitation that is extended, this privilege

61
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
that would be Jeremiah's, that he could call unto the Almighty God, the one who is the creator of

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,359
heaven and earth, the one who does all things well, God Almighty says to Jeremiah, call unto me.

63
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:36,720
What a privilege. Reminded of the great truth of the book of Hebrews in chapter four and verse 16,

64
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,079
again, a promise associated with it, but we think about that privilege where the Bible says, come

65
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,839
boldly unto the throne of grace. I'm reminded not only of that truth in Hebrews chapter four,

66
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,000
but I'm reminded as you continue to read through the book of Hebrews that we

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,040
read of this wonderful truth that is given to us in chapter number 10 in verse number 19 and 20,

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,359
where the Bible says this in Hebrews 10 verse 19 and 20, speaking about in desiring this evening

69
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:11,440
that we would recognize the privilege. The Bible says, having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter

70
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,040
into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, notice, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated

71
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:26,079
for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. Aren't you thankful that God provided for us

72
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:34,640
access? Jesus Christ, the son of God, God in flesh, he gave to us, he provided for us access that we

73
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,440
can come boldly to the throne of grace, that we have this privilege as the people of God. We must

74
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,200
not view prayer as some religious duty or some requirement that's placed upon us. No, I get to

75
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,839
spend time with the God of the universe, my savior, my God. I get to enter into his presence and I get

76
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:03,040
to pour my heart out to him. What a privilege. This evening, as we're reminded from this familiar

77
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:10,079
passage of scripture with regard to prayer, that we must recognize the privilege that God has given

78
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,880
to us to pray. Number two, I want you to notice as we continue reading here in verses seven and eight

79
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,160
and looking at these two verses together, we must resolve to be persistent. Resolve to be persistent.

80
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Notice in verse number eight, the Bible says, for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh

81
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,080
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open. And so we find that he says in verse seven,

82
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
ask and it shall be given. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. And then he

83
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
says, everyone that asketh, everyone that seeketh, everyone that knocketh. And we understand this

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,080
evening that there's something about persistent prayer. Resolve to be persistent. See, it's easy

85
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,280
for us to do something for a short period of time, but to labor in prayer. I'm talking about

86
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,960
laboring in prayer, being persistent in prayer. We find that in verse seven, it's these words are in

87
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,960
present tense, thus implying an ongoing action. Many of you would be familiar with the name George

88
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,359
Mueller. George Mueller is a hero of the faith. George Mueller is a man that has written, we have

89
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:27,760
so many written testimonies about the life and ministry of George Mueller, a man that prayed,

90
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:37,599
a man that saw God work in miraculous ways. And here's a statement that George Mueller made. He

91
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:47,280
says this, the great fault of the children of God is they do not continue in prayer. They do not go

92
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:55,840
on praying. They do not persevere. If they desire anything for God's glory, they should pray until

93
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,000
they get it. That's what George Mueller said. He said the fault, the great fault is that there's

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,760
not this persistent perseverance in prayer. Reminded of the truth in Luke 11 in verse number

95
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,719
eight, we won't turn there, but where the Bible talks about the one that would answer the friend,

96
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:21,119
the neighbor because of his importunity. And we find this evening that we must resolve to

97
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:27,119
be persistent again, that we're mindful of the fact that we are to continue to labor in prayer.

98
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:33,280
We understand this evening that prayer is work. Have you found it to be so? The enemy doesn't

99
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,719
like it when we pray. Why is that so? Because the enemy knows that God answers prayer.

100
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:46,239
The enemy knows the power of prayer. And no doubt this evening, as we look at this passage,

101
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:53,760
we're reminded about the privilege that is ours. And we recognize that privilege this evening,

102
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,840
that we can go to our God at any time for any reason. But we must also resolve that we would

103
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,960
be persistent in prayer, that we would persevere in prayer, that we would not get weary in well-doing,

104
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,200
not to the sense of vain repetitions and understand biblically the difference with that.

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,679
And we understand that we're pleading with God, we're persistent, seeking as even as George

106
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,200
Mueller pointed out, if they desire anything for God's glory. So we're praying for God to be

107
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,239
honored, for God to be glorified. We're praying as the Bible says, according to his will.

108
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,880
We have this promise that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. Isn't that

109
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,880
a blessing? And we understand this evening that there must be some resolve on the part of God's

110
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,719
people to be persistent in prayer, to persevere in prayer. I want you to notice as we look at

111
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:56,640
the remainder of the passage and look at this wonderful thought here that we must rest in the

112
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,320
promise, rest in the promise. See, God has given, there's connections made throughout the Scripture

113
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,200
with the subject of prayer. There are so many promises that are associated with prayer.

114
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,799
And we find this evening that as we look at this text of Scripture that we're reminded

115
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:23,200
that we must rest in the promise, we must rest. There are times in which we struggle to rest in

116
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,200
our Christian lives. There are times in which we struggle with stress and care and worry and

117
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,960
etc. But we must learn to rest and rest on the promises that God has provided to us.

118
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,320
We find that it says in verse 7, ask, notice what it says, and it shall be given.

119
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:51,039
Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. Isn't that a wonderful promise that God

120
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,679
gives us here? We find that beginning in verse number 9 and through the end of our text this

121
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,719
evening in verses 9 through 11 that God provides us with a physical or temporal illustration, example,

122
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:07,919
if you will, in order to drive home a spiritual truth. In fact, the Lord Jesus Christ during His

123
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,039
earthly ministry, He often taught this way. Often He would use, we often talk about the parables of

124
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,640
Jesus and how He would use an earthly example. He'd use something temporal, something that the people

125
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,760
could relate to, and He would teach a lesson, and He would use that example, that illustration,

126
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,520
in order to drive home a spiritual truth. And we find this evening that our God is holy. He's good.

127
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,799
He alone is good. And we find that He begins, as He looks here in verses 9 and 10, and He begins to

128
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:45,119
approach these individuals on the basis of their own behavior. And He says to them,

129
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:51,359
or what man is there of you? So you understand He's making it very personal to them as they're

130
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:56,640
gathered there, as they're having and listening to this discourse, the preaching of the Lord.

131
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:04,640
We find that He says, or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him

132
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:12,000
a stone? Now God doesn't provide for us any type of reaction from the crowd. There's no

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,039
dialogue that is provided here, but we understand that the question is asked, and Jesus is giving

134
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,080
this example. And I believe that as you look at verse number 9, and even if we were to look at

135
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,080
our own lives tonight and say, if our child, if our son were to ask us of bread, would we give

136
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:39,039
him a stone? No. Which one of us would do that? I don't know how many were gathered at this particular

137
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:44,080
time when Jesus is teaching, but many times there are multitudes of people that follow

138
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,880
Jesus. And as He's teaching, and as He's speaking about this, He says, which one of you,

139
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,359
if your son were to come and ask you for bread, which one of you would give him a stone?

140
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,359
Look around the crowd. I mean, yeah, no, I wouldn't do that. Why would I do that?

141
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:11,440
And then He says this, He's driving at home, or if he ask a fish, will He give him a serpent?

142
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:19,919
Again, if you look around the crowd, no. My son asked me for a fish, I'm not going to give him

143
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:27,440
a serpent. No way. And then notice what Jesus says, the master teacher. He says this in verse

144
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,799
number 11, if ye then, notice what the Bible says, being evil. Why does He use that phraseology?

145
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:41,840
Well, because if you compare us to God and our behaviors, and you look at this crowd that He's

146
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,039
speaking to, God is good, God is holy, and He's saying that you, you're evil, you're not at that

147
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,960
same level as who God is and what His attributes and character is, but yet you know how to give

148
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,159
good things to your children. And so He says, if ye then, being evil, know how to give good

149
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:09,919
gifts unto your children, and then I want you to see these three words, how much more? How much more

150
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:20,799
shall your Father, which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask Him?

151
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,159
Isn't that wonderful? We just rest in the promise this evening. We recognize the privilege. We must

152
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,840
resolve to be persistent, but we must rest in the promise that God has provided to us

153
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:42,559
with regard to prayer. We find that He, God, is perfect, He's holy, He's a good God, and we find

154
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,000
that He doeth all things well, and He says this, that He will give us good things. How much more

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,039
shall your Father, which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask Him? Do you remember what

156
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:04,400
James says? You have not because ye ask not. Now, there's another truth in the book of James. He

157
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,880
says you have not because you ask amiss. There are times in which we may be praying for something

158
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,479
that's not for God's glory, and He would say that you're asking amiss, but the reality is that we

159
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:24,079
understand. He says you have not because you ask not. The Bible says this in James 1, in verse

160
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,719
number 5, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth

161
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:37,680
not. The issue is that our God has all wisdom. He is omniscient. He is the all-wise God, and He

162
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,280
promises that He would give it to them that ask. The problem is sometimes in our lives we don't

163
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,400
acknowledge our need, and we don't ask, and then we don't have the wisdom that God has promised to

164
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:03,439
give us. It's available to us, but we've not asked for it. With each of those truths that I mentioned

165
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:09,439
in the beginning of the message this evening with regard to recognizing the privilege associated

166
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:16,319
with each of those verses that I shared in Jeremiah 33 and in Hebrews 4, we find that

167
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:22,719
there's a promise that's associated with that invitation, if you will, or that privilege.

168
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:28,880
God says this to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 33, 3, calling to me, and then He says this, and I will answer thee

169
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,599
and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. Isn't that a wonderful promise?

170
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Jeremiah was able to hear those words. If you read the book of Lamentations, you find that

171
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Jeremiah did call out to God. If you read the entirety of the book of Jeremiah, you see how God

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,920
graciously and mercifully blessed Jeremiah, even though the Babylonians came in and Nebuchadnezzar

173
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:05,040
led that campaign about taking the nation captive and destroying, and yet he says to one of his

174
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,920
captains, his men here to go and to take care of Jeremiah. Whatever he says, that's what you do.

175
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:23,520
It's amazing. Our God has given us wonderful promises. We read in Hebrews 4 and verse 16

176
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,680
where the Bible says that we're to come boldly under the throne of grace, but we understand that

177
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,880
that verse of Scripture gives us again a promise that's associated with it. Notice the Bible says,

178
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,880
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace. Why? Notice that we may obtain mercy

179
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,760
and find grace to help in time of need. Isn't that a wonderful promise? That we would obtain

180
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:59,119
mercy and that we would find grace to help in time of need. The reality this evening is that prayer

181
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,599
is a great privilege for the people of God. We need to recognize it. Prayer, someone noted,

182
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
should not be treated as a spare tire. What do they mean by that?

183
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,520
I believe this is what they mean by it. How many of you regularly check your spare tire?

184
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,199
Anyone? Regularly check it. How many of you even know if you have a spare tire?

185
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,640
I mean, how many of you know that you have a spare tire?

186
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,439
Okay, some of you. You know, I thought I had a spare tire and I found out I didn't.

187
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,400
Mark, you know when I found out I didn't? When I got a flat tire.

188
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,160
That's a bad time to find out you don't have a spare tire. I mean, it was a brand new vehicle,

189
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,400
but you know what they do with some of these brand new vehicles? They don't put spare tires

190
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,319
in them. You know why? Does anyone know why? No, it has nothing to do with buying it. It's weight.

191
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,119
They want the weight of the vehicle to be lower. The efficiency of fuel and so on and so forth,

192
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,359
and so some of these new vehicles, they don't have spare tires in them.

193
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,920
And then all of a sudden, you break down with a flat tire.

194
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,800
What do you do? You go look for the spare tire and you find out it's not there.

195
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,560
See, most of us, you're going to go check to see if you've got a spare tire tonight. You're going

196
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,760
to check this week. I understand. All right, but most of us, we don't ever think about our spare

197
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,599
tire until we need it. Right? We don't think about it.

198
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:40,479
Prayer shouldn't be treated that way. Prayer is not just something we have as a resource when we

199
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:49,920
have an emergency. No, it's communing with God. It's entering into the presence of our Savior.

200
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,319
It's having that sweet fellowship with Him. I preached a few Sunday nights ago,

201
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:05,119
pouring out our heart before Him. And this evening, I hope that we'd just be reminded tonight

202
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,920
with this thought of prayer. What a privilege it is.

203
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,479
Oh, that God would help us to be persistent, to persevere in prayer,

204
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,319
that we would be known as men and women of prayer.

205
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:25,839
We're reminded of Elijah. James mentions this, that

206
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,520
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

207
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,839
And then rest in the promise. Listen, when we take it to God, we trust that God's going to work

208
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,560
as only He can. And God has a plan that's better than our plan. And He doeth all things well.

209
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:51,839
And we just rest in His promise this evening. Ask, seek, knock. We see those simple thoughts

210
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,359
in Matthew 7, verses 7 through 11. We're reminded of how good our God is.

211
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:04,959
And He says to those that are gathered, if you're evil, and you know how to give good

212
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:11,680
gifts to your children, how much more? How much more? So your heavenly Father,

213
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,800
give good things unto them that ask Him. This evening, I hope that we would evaluate,

214
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,119
I hope that we would evaluate, just for a moment, our prayer lives. And let God have

215
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:34,239
His will and way. Let's have some honest and humble evaluation of our own prayer lives.

216
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,160
And understand this evening that one of the greatest privileges for a child of God

217
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,599
is so often neglected by the people of God. Let's pray together. Father, we love You.

218
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,800
We thank You for loving us. We thank You tonight.

219
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,079
Just for a few moments, we've had the opportunity to look at this familiar passage. And I pray the

220
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,800
Holy Spirit of God would move and work in hearts and lives as only He can. God, would You help us

221
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:12,160
in just these short moments to have an honest evaluation of our own personal prayer lives?

222
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,800
Lord, I pray that You'd help us to rest in the promises that You've given to us associated with

223
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:29,359
prayer. Help us, Lord, to resolve to be persistent in prayer, to persevere. And God, help us to

224
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,479
recognize it's a privilege, it's an absolute privilege to enter into Your presence, that at

225
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:44,719
any moment, at any time, we can come boldly to Your throne. We can enter into Your presence

226
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,239
knowing that You hear us and knowing that You're able. I pray that You'd work in this moment of

227
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:54,640
invitation as only You can. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me, heads
