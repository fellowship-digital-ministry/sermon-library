1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Genesis chapter 33, we had some extra specials tonight, I shared the situation there about

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,560
love thy neighbor, so you listen fast, I'm going to preach fast, amen?

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,719
And we got a fellowship over in the other room after the service, and a farewell fellowship

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,719
for Jared.

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,600
We're going to look at the entirety of Genesis 33 this evening, but it's only 20 verses,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,399
and so not too bad, and trust the Lord to help us here.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,239
I've titled the message, as you look at the back of the bulletin there, from verse number

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:35,279
11, the Bible says in verse 11, take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee,

9
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:41,919
because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough, and he urged him,

10
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:42,919
and he took it.

11
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:47,720
I'm telling the message this evening, God hath dealt graciously with me.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,040
Of course, as we looked at Genesis chapter number 32, that long, life-altering night

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,200
that we studied a couple of weeks ago, we find the reunion between Jacob and Esau would

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,680
finally come to pass.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,300
As we have noted, Jacob is quite concerned about this reunion.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,959
We understand that Jacob has departed from Paddan Aram to go back to the land of his

17
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,879
fathers at the instruction, as a result of the instruction of the Lord.

18
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,800
God had given him the instruction to return, and Jacob was obedient to that instruction,

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,400
and we find that he's now going back, and he knows that he has to have this reunion

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
with his brother.

21
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:34,199
Of course, he had sent some men ahead in order to just prepare the way, and he found out

22
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,800
that Esau was coming with 400 men, and he was quite concerned.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,440
And so, as we look at this text of Scripture, God records for us this account of this reunion

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,480
between Jacob and Esau, and we find that within the text that Jacob makes that great declaration

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,680
that God hath dealt graciously with me.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,199
I believe that this evening that each one of us could agree with Jacob, and we could

27
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,440
understand that God has been gracious to us.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,599
He's been so, so good to us, and what a blessing to know the Lord.

29
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,320
If you are taking notes this evening, number one, Jacob embraced his brother.

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,479
In verses one through four, we see the reunion recorded for us, and what an amazing scene

31
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,919
that God gives us.

32
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,639
I'm thankful that God has recorded these verses of Scripture, this event in the life of Jacob,

33
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,600
for it's certainly impactful.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,119
First the Bible begins in verse number one, and Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and

35
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:34,399
behold, Esau came, and notice what it says, and with him 400 men.

36
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:40,039
Now he'd already known that in the beginning of chapter 32, he'd received that intel report.

37
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,279
The Bible continues, though, and says, and he, speaking of Jacob, divided the children

38
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,479
unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

39
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,479
Why did he do that?

40
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,800
Remember, he was concerned that Esau was going to kill him, and also kill his wives and children.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,399
It says in verse number two, that he put the handmaids and their children foremost,

42
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:01,600
and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost, and he passed over

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,960
before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,039
And I love verse number four, for the Bible says, and Esau ran to meet him, and embraced

45
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:20,679
him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.

46
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:26,240
Isn't that a beautiful account of this reunion between Jacob and his brother Esau, and we

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,800
find that Jacob and Esau, there's an embrace.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,559
It tells us in verse number four that Esau runs to meet him, and now Esau, the last that

49
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:41,279
we've heard of Esau with regard to his perspective of Jacob, is that he's going to kill Jacob.

50
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:46,759
He was angry over the blessing and all that had taken place, but we find that nearly 20

51
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,520
years has passed since that time, and we find this great reunion.

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,919
I believe that as we look at these few verses of Scripture that record for us this reunion

53
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,320
and this embrace between Jacob and Esau, it's a great example and a great picture of forgiveness

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,839
and reconciliation.

55
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:12,800
So often I've said over the years that two pillars of biblical Christianity, and it's

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,920
just two of many pillars of biblical Christianity, but two pillars of biblical Christianity are

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,239
forgiveness and reconciliation.

58
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:25,519
And I'm so thankful for the fact that we've been forgiven.

59
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,640
Isn't it wonderful to know the forgiveness of God?

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,359
The Bible says that with thee there is forgiveness.

61
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:38,839
Our God is a God that's ready to pardon, He's ready to forgive, and as the people of God

62
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,160
we understand something about forgiveness because we have been forgiven, and therefore

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,679
we are to forgive others.

64
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,519
The Bible says in Ephesians 4 and verse 32,

65
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:55,000
"...and be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,720
sake hath forgiven you."

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,880
I didn't deserve to be forgiven.

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,959
It's God's grace and God's mercy that led to me being forgiven, and I'm so thankful

69
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,079
that God is rich in mercy, that God's grace is amazing and it's abundant, and this evening

70
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,239
we think about this truth of forgiveness, and then we think about reconciliation.

71
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,200
What a joy to understand the truth of reconciliation.

72
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,320
See, we've often spoken over the years, and yes, there's truth in the Bible with regard

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,679
to church discipline and dealing with sin and so on and so forth, but the purpose of

74
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:34,399
church discipline is not excommunication.

75
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,079
The true purpose of church discipline is reconciliation and restoration.

76
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,079
That's the idea.

77
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,440
Listen, God's people need to belong to a church.

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,000
The church is God's idea, it's God's plan, and God has instituted the church, and God

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,040
has given us instructions with regard to church discipline, and from time to time it's necessary

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:05,920
because of an offense and what have you, but the purpose is always reconciliation, restoration,

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:13,440
and we rejoice in that truth, the biblical truth of reconciliation and restoration, and

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
it's coupled there with forgiveness, and I'm mindful of what Galatians 6 tells us.

83
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,320
It tells us this, brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, notice

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,920
what it says, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest

85
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,239
thou also be tempted, and we think about that restoration, and back a couple of summers

86
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:42,920
ago, my dad preached through Psalm 23 on Wednesday evenings, and I want to remind you what the

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,839
Bible says in Psalm 23.

88
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:51,799
He says, he, speaking of the Lord being our shepherd, he restoreth my soul, and what a

89
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:57,399
blessing to understand this evening, and then to see this picture between Jacob and

90
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,399
Esau.

91
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,640
I mean, again, Jacob, why did he leave?

92
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,519
Mom said, hey, I've heard that Esau's going to kill you.

93
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,920
You need to go a little ways, and you need to get away for a little while so that his

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,880
anger will depart, and after 20 years, this reunion is given to us, and it's a reunion

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,679
that's sweet.

96
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,679
There's an embrace.

97
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:27,000
The Bible says that he ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck and kissed him, and

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
they wept.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,239
Isn't that beautiful?

100
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:37,920
I understand that as I look at this passage of Scripture, and I think about this event

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,799
that's been provided for us, this record that's been given, what a joy it is to have that

102
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:47,920
sweet communion and fellowship one with another.

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,880
There are individuals, believers, that have been at odds at one another for sometime years

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,279
and years and years, and they just dig in their heels, and they refuse to forgive, refuse

105
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,519
to have any level of restoration or reconciliation, and oh, that that would never be said of us

106
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,640
as God's people, that we'd understand that our God is ready to pardon, ready to forgive,

107
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,279
and because we've been forgiven, that we too are to forgive others, and we think about

108
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,000
this great example where Jacob embraced his brother.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,679
Not only did Jacob embrace his brother, but number two, if you're taking notes, Jacob

110
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:26,760
explained God's blessing.

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
Jacob explained God's blessing.

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,359
He testified a little bit, begins in verse number five, he lifted up his eyes and saw

113
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:36,280
the women and the children and said, who are those with thee?

114
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,359
This is Esau asking Jacob about what he now sees, and Jacob responds and says this at

115
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:50,799
the end of verse number five, the children which God hath graciously given thy servant.

116
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,239
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves, and Leah

117
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:59,599
also with her children came near and bowed themselves, and after came Joseph near and

118
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:04,520
Rachel and they bowed themselves, and he said, what meanest thou by all this drove which

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I met?

120
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,400
And he said, these are divine grace in the sight of my Lord.

121
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Remember, we studied this in chapter 32 a couple of weeks ago, where he had prepared

122
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,239
that present and he sent those droves of cattle and livestock so that they would go, and he

123
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:23,039
was trying to appease his brother Esau, and in fact, it says exactly that in verse number

124
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,039
20 of chapter 32, and say ye moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us, for he said,

125
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,280
I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face.

126
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,359
Peradventure, he will accept of me.

127
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,919
And so Esau says, hey, what is all of this that I see?

128
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,640
He sees the women and the children, he now references the droves of livestock, and it

129
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,840
says this in verse number 9, and Esau said, I have enough, my brother, keep that thou

130
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,119
hast unto thyself.

131
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:56,119
And Jacob said, nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive

132
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:59,919
my present at my hand, for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I

133
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,819
had seen the face of God, and thou was pleased with me."

134
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:04,939
Notice verse number 11.

135
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,199
I read it by way of introduction,

136
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,039
but notice it says,

137
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,179
take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee,

138
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,899
because God hath dealt graciously with me,

139
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,419
and because I have enough.

140
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,979
And he urged him, and he took it.

141
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,459
And he said, let us take our journey,

142
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,899
and let us go, and I will go before thee.

143
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,419
As we look at these verses of scripture,

144
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,019
really in verses five through 11,

145
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,699
we see that Jacob is explaining the blessing of God.

146
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,259
I want you to think about these 20 years,

147
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,219
and much of what we've studied,

148
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,379
and obviously it was a long time ago

149
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,059
that we're studying the time that he was there

150
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,539
in Paddan Aram, and all that took place,

151
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,059
but as we're familiar with the text of scripture,

152
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,859
and the record that God gives us,

153
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,799
we find that it is absolutely true

154
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,259
that during that period of time,

155
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,759
that Jacob experienced some hardship.

156
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,099
He experienced some difficulty.

157
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,699
There were some things, some circumstances

158
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:57,739
that were not what we might describe

159
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,179
as being favorable or desirable.

160
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,659
But we find that when Jacob and Esau have this reunion,

161
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:06,219
and after the embrace, and then Jacob explains

162
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,899
the blessing of God, I'm thankful that as I read

163
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,299
these verses of scripture in verses five through 11,

164
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:13,319
you know what you don't see?

165
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,819
You don't see any complaining.

166
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,859
You don't see Jacob saying to Esau,

167
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,579
listen, let me tell you how bad it was.

168
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,099
Let me tell you all the bad things that I experienced

169
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,459
when I was there in Paddan Aram,

170
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,139
and let me tell you how they weren't fair,

171
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:27,579
and how this happened, and that happened,

172
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,979
you don't read any complaining.

173
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,579
Not only do you not read any complaining,

174
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,219
but you find that Jacob didn't blame Esau

175
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:35,579
for anything that happened.

176
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,979
He could have been bitter at Esau.

177
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,339
Why did he leave in the first place?

178
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,819
Because Esau said he was gonna kill him.

179
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,499
And he leaves.

180
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:48,459
And sometimes when we experience some difficulties

181
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,179
and hardships, we're looking for someone

182
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,259
to put the blame on.

183
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,419
Sometimes that's what happens in life.

184
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,179
But I don't read that in Jacob's testimony.

185
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:00,819
I read that Jacob, as he's explaining what's taken place,

186
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,979
there's no complaining, there's no blame

187
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:07,019
that's being placed upon Esau.

188
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,899
I also recognize this.

189
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,019
Jacob doesn't take any credit for himself.

190
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,379
When Esau asks in verse number five,

191
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,099
when he says he looked up his eyes

192
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,659
and saw the women and the children and said,

193
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,699
who are those with thee?

194
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,659
And then in verse number eight, when he says,

195
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,259
what meanest thou by all this drove which I met?

196
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,379
Jacob doesn't say, yeah, it's been pretty good, man.

197
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,899
I really made it.

198
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,059
I mean, I went out there and I did all of this

199
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,179
and I, that's not what Jacob says.

200
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,499
There's no boasting.

201
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,339
There's no complaining.

202
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,299
There's no blaming.

203
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,019
There's no boasting.

204
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,699
We find that Jacob explains

205
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,779
and he declares the goodness of God.

206
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,699
He declares the goodness of God.

207
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,779
We find that in this text of Scripture

208
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,059
that he recognized it was God that had blessed him.

209
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,459
He recognized that it was God

210
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,019
that had graciously given him the children.

211
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,779
Notice in verse number five, he said,

212
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,779
the children which God hath graciously given thy servant.

213
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,659
When he speaks about the droves,

214
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,539
when the question is asked in verse number eight

215
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,219
and he speaks about the present,

216
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,899
he says in verse number 11,

217
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,899
take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee.

218
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:22,739
Why?

219
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,139
Because God hath dealt graciously with me

220
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,499
and because I have enough.

221
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,139
And he urged him and he took it.

222
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,059
Not only did he recognize that it was God

223
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,179
that had blessed him,

224
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:37,899
but Jacob was careful to give God the glory.

225
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,219
He was careful to give God the glory.

226
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,259
See, sometimes in our lives,

227
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,499
we might recognize that it's God that has blessed,

228
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,299
but there might be just a little part of us

229
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,059
that wants to have a little glory.

230
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,219
Sometimes that's the way it works.

231
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,699
But we find that Jacob is recognizing

232
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:59,419
it's God's good hand of blessing.

233
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,739
God hath dealt graciously with me.

234
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,139
I notice in the text of Scripture

235
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,739
that even as we've studied in Psalm 37

236
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:07,659
on Wednesday evenings,

237
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,159
for those that are part of that study,

238
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,099
we talk about the blessed and the righteous individual

239
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,379
that is referenced throughout Psalm 37.

240
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,779
And as we look at that text of Scripture,

241
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,859
the Bible talks about how the righteous,

242
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:25,259
how that they give and how that they are benevolent.

243
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,099
Why?

244
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,299
Because God is benevolent.

245
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,219
And so we find here, even within in Psalm 37, 21,

246
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,099
if you want to reference it,

247
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:36,619
it says that the righteous showeth mercy and giveth.

248
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,339
The righteous showeth mercy and giveth.

249
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,519
Why do they show mercy?

250
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,299
Well, because we've received mercy.

251
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,119
Why do they give?

252
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,459
Because God's given to us.

253
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,619
And so we find here that Jacob recognizes

254
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,779
the blessing of God, he gives God the glory,

255
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,399
but then he and himself, he wants to be a blessing.

256
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,939
He says, take I pray thee.

257
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,939
Notice the wording of verse number 11.

258
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:03,659
Take I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee.

259
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,859
God blessed me, and now I can be a blessing to someone else.

260
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,639
We sing the song channels only.

261
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,579
Being a channel, a conduit of God's blessing.

262
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,379
As God pours out the blessing,

263
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,379
it's not so that we can just gather as much as we can gather

264
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,419
and try to build bigger barns and so on and so forth,

265
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,979
but God's blessed us so that we can be a blessing.

266
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:33,139
I mean, this is great truth in the life of Jacob.

267
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,579
We find this evening that I believe each and every one of us

268
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:45,739
we'd be honest, God hath dealt graciously with me.

269
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:48,999
God's been so good to us.

270
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,119
Psalm 68 and verse number 19,

271
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,099
read just a few verses of scripture.

272
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,079
As we make some application in our own lives,

273
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,659
listen, God's been good to us.

274
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,979
So, so good.

275
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,219
We're so undeserving.

276
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,499
You know, there are times that we don't even thank Him

277
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,459
like we should.

278
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,739
He's still so good to us.

279
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,559
It's amazing how good God is.

280
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:22,939
Notice in Psalm 68, specifically look at verse number 19.

281
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,199
The Bible says,

282
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,199
blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits,

283
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,419
even the God of our salvation, Selah.

284
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:34,699
You read that word Selah,

285
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,259
of course we've mentioned this before,

286
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,339
it's pause, meditate, think about this, chew on it.

287
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,979
Let the truth sink in.

288
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,459
But I want you to notice that middle phrase, if you will,

289
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:47,899
of this verse of scripture,

290
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:52,899
where the Bible says who daily loadeth us with benefits.

291
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:55,939
I like the wording.

292
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,219
I like how God gives us this picture

293
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,019
of just how good He's been to us.

294
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,979
He doesn't just give us a little bit of a blessing,

295
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:05,999
He loads us with benefits.

296
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,699
In my mind's eye, in my sanctified imagination,

297
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,339
I see kind of a wheelbarrow, if you will,

298
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,699
and you're trying to fill that thing up.

299
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,419
And I mean, you just get it as full as you can

300
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,979
because you want to make as few trips as possible

301
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,179
and man, it's just over

302
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,539
and you're trying to steer that thing.

303
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,359
Have you ever been there?

304
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,259
You ever done that before?

305
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,939
And then all of a sudden you put too much in it

306
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,099
and you tilt that thing over

307
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,859
and then you got a mess and you got to start over.

308
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,259
But in my mind's eye, I kind of,

309
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,439
that's how I like to think about God

310
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:35,439
who has daily loadeth us with benefits, with blessings.

311
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,839
With blessings.

312
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,519
We sing the song, count your blessings,

313
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,979
name them one by one.

314
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,059
I wonder how often we really in our lives

315
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,599
go through that discipline of counting our blessings

316
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,799
and name them one by one.

317
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,399
We're in such a fast-paced society.

318
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,519
I mentioned that when I spoke about loving our neighbor

319
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,859
and praying for them for a month

320
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,759
and sometimes that persistence wears off

321
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,679
because we're just an immediate satisfaction

322
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,179
kind of a society.

323
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,619
You wait too long at the,

324
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:05,779
wherever you fill in the blank

325
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:06,979
and you're like, hey, what's going on?

326
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:09,499
Come on, let's go, right?

327
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:11,919
And you think about that pausing.

328
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,819
Be still and know that I am God.

329
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,299
That's what he said.

330
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,659
We just take some time and say,

331
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,339
God, you've been so good.

332
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,379
Let me just start writing out all of your blessings.

333
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,619
All of your blessings.

334
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,459
I walked in my office this afternoon.

335
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,619
I'm sure you've done this before as well.

336
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,379
And sometimes you just do it by habit.

337
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:32,700
You walk into a room and the first thing you do

338
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,779
is just turn the light switch and then keep on walking.

339
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,099
You know, I walk in my office this afternoon,

340
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,179
I hit the light switch even though the light was on.

341
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,299
Just out of habit.

342
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,820
I just walk in the room and I bam

343
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,200
and it's like, oh yeah, it's already on.

344
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,700
I just kept on, it wasn't a senior moment.

345
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,419
It was just a habit.

346
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,099
That's at least my story and I'm gonna stick to it, amen.

347
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,539
But the reality is that sometimes

348
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,260
we just take it for granted.

349
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,260
I read that report about the Robinsons in Zambia

350
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,959
that for 12 hours a day,

351
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,459
they're gonna have no electricity.

352
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:04,779
Most of us wouldn't survive.

353
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,179
I'm just being honest.

354
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,099
Wouldn't have anything to power our cell phones

355
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,099
and this, that, and the other thing, it'd be a mess.

356
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,260
God's been so good to us.

357
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,519
So, so good.

358
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,899
Look in 1 Corinthians chapter four.

359
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:19,899
I need to move along here.

360
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,380
1 Corinthians chapter four.

361
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,820
Notice what the Bible says.

362
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,579
In 1 Corinthians chapter number four,

363
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,099
I'm gonna read a verse as you're turning there

364
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,579
from the book of James,

365
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:36,299
a verse that we're familiar with in James one and 17.

366
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,859
The Bible says every good gift

367
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,419
and every perfect gift is from above

368
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,059
and cometh down from the father of lights

369
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,299
with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

370
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,899
The book of 1 Corinthians in chapter number four.

371
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:52,260
In verse number seven, the Bible says this.

372
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,739
For who maketh thee to differ from another?

373
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,539
And then look at this question.

374
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,539
And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?

375
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:07,819
Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?

376
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:11,339
Specifically as Paul is going to be dealing with the church in Corinth about spiritual

377
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,339
gifts, we find that there's certainly some reference there with regard to spiritual gifts

378
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,379
and understand the Lord gives as He wills.

379
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,899
But I want you to think about this truth broadly speaking.

380
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,019
What hast thou that thou didst not receive?

381
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,299
So often we have a wrong, a poor perspective when we think about life and we think, well,

382
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:35,259
I'm a self-made man, I got here, I did this and I did that and I worked hard, and so on

383
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,259
and so forth.

384
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:40,219
And the reality is that you may have worked hard and you may have studied diligently,

385
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:44,699
but it's God who gave you the ability to do that.

386
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:49,339
And so we have to dig deeper and dig deeper and find out, look, in Deuteronomy chapter

387
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,779
8 and verse number 18 it says this, but thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is

388
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,659
He that giveth thee power to get wealth.

389
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,059
It's all God.

390
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,719
Remember the truth that Jesus gave in John?

391
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,459
He says, without me you can do nothing.

392
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:09,059
You go ahead and think you can do something without God, you're going to find out really

393
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,939
quick that you can't.

394
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,619
It's God's air that we're breathing.

395
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:17,739
It's only by God's grace right now that we're even here.

396
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:22,919
And we recognize here this evening that God has been so good to us and Jacob, after he

397
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,659
embraces his brother, he then explains God's blessing.

398
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,939
In the next several verses we read of the journey that takes place, there's a departure

399
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:34,139
that's documented and arrivals to different places.

400
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:40,259
Notice it says in verse number 12, back in Genesis 33, and he said, let us take our journey

401
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,899
and let us go and I will go before thee.

402
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:46,419
And he said unto him, my Lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and

403
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:52,739
herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will

404
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,599
die.

405
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,279
Let my Lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant.

406
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,879
Notice this phrase, and I will lead on softly.

407
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:01,999
There's some wisdom in that.

408
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,359
It's not the duration of the message this evening.

409
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,359
But the thing of leading, and he says, I will lead on softly.

410
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,559
He understood the state of his flock, according to verse number 13.

411
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,639
By the way, Proverbs talks about that.

412
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:20,279
He understood the state of his flock and he said, look, it's not good for me to overdrive

413
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,279
them.

414
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,759
It's not good for me to become in a place where we're vulnerable.

415
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,959
And so he understood what was going on and he says, I will lead on softly, in the middle

416
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:34,819
of verse number 14, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able

417
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:38,579
to endure until I come unto my Lord, unto seer.

418
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:43,499
You know, sometimes, this is a good truth for me, sometimes as leaders you get too far

419
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,499
out in front.

420
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:53,019
You got to lead on softly, carefully, understanding the importance of those that God has given

421
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:58,699
you the opportunity to lead, husbands, parents, leading your children.

422
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:02,659
Sometimes we can get crazy in our mind about why our kids don't get what they're supposed

423
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,299
to get and try to reason with them.

424
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,419
I was forever trying to reason with my kids before they could even begin to try to reason

425
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:13,779
And my dad would look at me and say, what are you doing?

426
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,699
What do you mean, what am I doing?

427
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:16,699
I'm parenting, amen?

428
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,699
They don't understand.

429
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:25,139
And he was probably right, there were times in which they just didn't understand.

430
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:28,859
Notice it continues in verse 15, and Esau said, let me now leave with thee some of the

431
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,019
folk that are with me.

432
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,859
And he said, what needeth it?

433
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,499
Let me find grace in the sight of my Lord.

434
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,619
So Esau returned that day on his way unto seer.

435
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,979
And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built him a house and made booths for his cattle.

436
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:45,019
Therefore, the name of the place is called Succoth.

437
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:48,059
And so we don't look, as you look at the text of scripture, then in verse number 18, it

438
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,859
says, and Jacob came to Shalom.

439
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,699
Now there's probably a period of time between 17 and 18 that we don't know the duration

440
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,499
of time between those verses.

441
00:23:55,499 --> 00:24:00,299
Many people have offered various opinions with regard to how long he was there in Succoth

442
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,699
according to verse number 17, before he went to Shalom, a city of Shechem in verse number

443
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:05,699
18.

444
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,819
And I'll leave that to be debated by the scholars, because I don't know the answer.

445
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,059
The Bible doesn't tell us, but it does seem like there's a period of time that takes place

446
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:17,019
where he was there in Succoth according to verse number 17.

447
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:21,659
But then in verse number 18, it says this, and Jacob came to Shalom, a city of Shechem,

448
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,579
which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram and pitched his tent before

449
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:28,779
the city.

450
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,919
And here's where we get to our final point this evening.

451
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,919
We see that Jacob embraced his brother.

452
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,479
Jacob explained God's blessing.

453
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:40,559
And then number three, if you're taking notes tonight, Jacob erected an altar.

454
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,479
Notice what the Bible says after he comes and pitches his tent in this place.

455
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:50,039
In verse number 19, it says that he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his

456
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,839
tent at the hand of the children of Hamar, Shechem's father, for 100 pieces of money.

457
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:02,079
And verse number 20 says, and he erected there an altar and called it El Elohi Israel.

458
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,519
I want you to think about the significance of this, and we find that it would certainly

459
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,199
be fitting that Jacob would erect this altar with all that he experienced and with all

460
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:18,639
that he knew, with all that had already, we've already looked at in Genesis chapter 33.

461
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:23,599
We find that he comes to this place, and he's going to be there, and he erects this altar

462
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,479
and he names it.

463
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:28,999
I want you to think about the significance, of course we've mentioned this in other portions

464
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:35,239
of Scripture, where the significance of a name, and how that Jacob in so doing, he had

465
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:39,539
the opportunity to name this altar whatever he really wanted to name the altar.

466
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,479
You read in the book of Joshua, and you don't need to turn there, but after the two and

467
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:47,699
a half tribes are going to depart and all that's taking place after the conquering

468
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:53,239
of the land that is given to us, we find that they were going to have an altar, they were

469
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:58,559
going to erect there, and they called it Ed, because it was a witness between them.

470
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,559
That's what it meant.

471
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,999
I remember teaching through that passage, and somebody came to me and said, what does

472
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:02,999
that mean?

473
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,539
It means a witness between them, that's what the Bible says.

474
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:13,419
But here we find that he says that he named this altar, he called it El Elohi Israel.

475
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:19,599
It means a mighty God is the God of Israel, a mighty God.

476
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,319
I want you to think about God's power, God's might.

477
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,879
Listen, I'm thankful this evening that our God is omnipotent.

478
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,479
I mentioned in Sunday school for those that were here this morning about the opposition

479
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:38,439
and how that the enemy is powerful, but he's limited in his power.

480
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:42,619
We serve the omnipotent God, the Almighty God.

481
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:47,059
Remember it was Abraham that first had that introduction from God when he said that his

482
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,659
name was El Shaddai, the Almighty God.

483
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:57,499
And here, as Jacob would set up this altar and he would give it a name, he says El Elohi

484
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:02,219
Israel, a mighty God is the God of Israel, and I'm so thankful that we serve a mighty

485
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,219
God.

486
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,759
He's great in power.

487
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,739
Jacob had experienced the power of God.

488
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:17,019
Jacob had witnessed in his life and an experience that he served a God who was mighty, was strong,

489
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,019
was powerful.

490
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,419
And this evening, I want you to understand that our God is all powerful.

491
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,939
The Bible says that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, and I'm thankful that there's nothing

492
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,979
that's too hard for him.

493
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:36,699
The question that he asked Abraham all those years ago, millennia ago, he said, is anything

494
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:39,579
too hard for the Lord?

495
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:46,379
Still to this very day, there's nothing that's too hard for our God.

496
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,099
He's able.

497
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,179
We speak about prayer.

498
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:57,299
We take and claim promises, calling to me, and I will answer thee and show thee great

499
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,219
and mighty things which thou knowest not.

500
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:06,219
The truth of Ephesians, when he says that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above

501
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:10,139
all that we could ask or think, that's our God.

502
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:13,579
He's a mighty God, and he's able.

503
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:20,319
And after all these events in Jacob's life, when he comes to this place and settles down

504
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:27,619
and purchases this piece of property from the hand of the children of Hamar, we find

505
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:36,139
that he puts this altar in place, and he names it El Elohi Israel.

506
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:43,559
Mighty God is the God of Israel, and I'm thankful that still today we serve the mighty God.

507
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,339
What a mighty God we serve.

508
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:46,339
He's able.

509
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:47,339
You say, I got this problem.

510
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,339
I got this difficulty.

511
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:49,339
I got this.

512
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,339
God's able.

513
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,899
God's powerful.

514
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:57,419
We trust him, and we know that he'll give us the grace and the strength that is necessary

515
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:05,099
to go through whatever that he's allowed to come in your path or in my path.

516
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,039
He'll give us the strength for it.

517
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,619
I know there are times we say, well, this isn't what I would have chosen.

518
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,299
I get it.

519
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,299
I get it.

520
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:20,199
But God says that his strength is made perfect in weakness.

521
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:24,599
When I am weak, then I am strong.

522
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,239
What a blessing to look at this passage of Scripture, to see a reunion, the embrace between

523
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,239
Jacob and Esau.

524
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,699
Isn't that precious?

525
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:37,759
And then the explanation that Jacob gives, listen, God has been so good to me.

526
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,039
Let me tell you what God's done.

527
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,339
He's been so gracious.

528
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,059
And then he sets up this altar, El Elohi Israel.

529
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,099
We serve a mighty God.

530
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,579
He's been so good to us.

531
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:54,659
Oh, that we would understand the importance of forgiveness and restoration, and that we

532
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,779
would lift up our voices and praise to our God, for he is worthy.

533
00:29:58,779 --> 00:29:59,779
Let's pray.

534
00:29:59,779 --> 00:29:59,940
Father, we love you.

535
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,380
We thank You for loving us. We thank You for the account that You've given us this evening of this

536
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:12,100
reunion between Jacob and Esau and the events that followed. God, I pray that we'd be challenged

537
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,500
through this record tonight. Lord, that we'd be challenged in our own lives to

538
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,140
recognize that we've been forgiven and then to forgive.

539
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,620
Lord, I pray there'd be nothing between my soul and my Savior, but I also pray

540
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,420
that we'd have nothing between us as brothers and sisters of Christ, in Christ.

541
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,460
Lord, I pray that You'd help us to acknowledge Your good hand of blessing that's been upon us.

542
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,580
God, You've dealt graciously with us. You've been so good to us. I pray that You'd help us

543
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,460
to recognize Your strength, Your might, Your power. Help us to trust You and prove You.

544
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,020
I pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

545
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,060
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only You can.

546
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,340
We'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray.
