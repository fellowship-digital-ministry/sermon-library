1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,619
That are filled with great truth for us this morning that I trust will be a blessing to you

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,140
Romans chapter number 16 be looking at verses 1 and 2 of course as you know today in the United States of America

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,280
We celebrate Mother's Day and a number of countries around the globe have on their calendar a day

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,520
In which they celebrate Mother's Day a number of them will celebrate Mother's Day today

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
However, there are some countries that celebrate Mother's Day on different days

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,319
Than what we do here in the United States of America, but it's interesting to understand how many nations

7
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,880
Recognize and set aside a day on their calendar for Mother's Day

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:45,380
Of course, we as we have said a number of times already this morning are thankful for the role of mothers the role of ladies

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,840
In the church and the work of the church you read about the truth and Titus chapter number two

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,840
In the Bible gives us great truth there with regard to the role of ladies in the church

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,799
You can keep yourself there in Romans 16

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:07,400
But the Bible speaks about the aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,040
Not given to much wine

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,599
Teachers of good things notice that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love

15
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,120
Their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,839
But the Word of God be not blasphemed. And so there is a role that ladies play in the church

17
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,879
Of course today we deal with Mother's Day

18
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:34,720
But speaking generically and across the board with ladies what a blessing to see the role that God has given

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
For you in the local church

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,919
This morning as we look at Romans chapter number 16

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,319
We read of one such individual as you look at the entirety of the chapter Romans 16

22
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,040
You'll find that just as the case in a number of the epistles that Paul writes

23
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:54,839
He will in the latter part of those particular letters

24
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:59,760
He will mention a number of folks by name some of those individuals that he mentions by name

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,119
we know many things about because they are referenced in other portions of scripture and as they are referenced in other portions of scripture and

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,679
We compare scripture with scripture and study the Word of God. We have an opportunity to gain

27
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:17,440
Some insight with regard to these particular characters

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:23,300
Well, the individual that we're gonna look at this morning is only mentioned here in Romans 16 verses 1 and 2

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,919
So I would say this there's not a whole lot that we know

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,520
About her but I will say this the little that we know about her her tells us a whole lot

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,919
I hope that makes sense to you because as we look through these two verses of scripture, we'll make four

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,600
observations about this sister

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,199
Her name is Phoebe. I've titled the message this morning Phoebe our sister notice in verse number one of Romans 16

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,279
Paul says I commend unto you

35
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,919
Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the church

36
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,960
which is that Santerra that ye receive her in the Lord as

37
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:06,839
Becometh Saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,399
She hath need of you for she hath been a suckerer of many and of myself

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,440
Also again, just two verses of scripture

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,199
But with the four observations that we will make from these two verses of scripture

41
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:29,360
I believe that God gives us some great insight into the character of this lady that her name is

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,199
Phoebe Phoebe our sister the first observation that I would make is this number one if you're taking notes

43
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,919
Notice that she was converted she was converted now

44
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,800
This is important as we begin to understand what Paul is saying and how he refers to her as Phoebe our sister

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,399
He's not writing to his brother about his sister in the flesh. We find that he's writing to a church

46
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,559
He's writing to believers if you read Romans chapter number one

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,800
You'll find that he's writing to the believers that are in Rome also and as he's writing to those

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,160
Believers and as he himself is a believer a follower of Jesus Christ

49
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,559
He speaks of Phoebe as being our

50
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,600
sister

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,399
What does he mean by that? Why does he use that terminology?

52
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:18,959
well, we understand that Paul as he was on the road to Damascus in the book of

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Acts as we read the ninth chapter

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,279
We read about Paul's personal conversion when he trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal

55
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,440
Savior and what a great change was made in the life of Paul

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,480
of course at that time his name was Saul and as he was going for the purpose of

57
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Persecution in finding any that were of that way

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,200
believers and followers of Jesus Christ that he would have the authority to arrest them and and bring them back to

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Jerusalem and he was even consenting unto the death as we read with regard to Stephen in Acts chapter number seven

60
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,880
But we find that Paul his name being Saul at that particular time. He was converted

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,720
He trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and now any other believer

62
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,559
Would be referred to as being a brother or sister in Christ

63
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:20,880
And so Paul we do not know much about Phoebe. We do not know much about her conversion. We do not know specifically

64
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:27,839
How it was that she came to know the Lord Jesus Christ. However, we know that she was in Rome

65
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,839
We don't know why she's there

66
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,640
We understand that she was there probably for some sort of business as it says in verse number two that you assist her in whatsoever

67
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,640
Business she hath need of you, but we understand that she belonged to the church that was located

68
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,920
the port city of Corinth

69
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,079
Sincera as it's mentioned at the end of verse number one

70
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,720
this is a location the port city of the city of Corinth and we understand much about the

71
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,559
the church at Corinth

72
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,440
we understand as we would look to the book of Acts and read through the

73
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:07,799
account of the missionary journeys how the Apostle Paul had the privilege of going into Corinth and

74
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,559
Preaching the gospel and seeing a church established and as that church was established. We understand that they had many problems

75
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
Amen

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,000
There was a church that was full of problems a church that as the book of 1st Corinthians is written to them

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,839
Paul addresses a number of those issues

78
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,679
But we understand that many people came to trust the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior

79
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,399
in fact

80
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,839
it was the Lord Jesus Christ that appeared to Paul and said I have much people in this city and

81
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:43,839
What a blessing to think about the people that were saved through the ministry of the Apostle Paul in the city of Corinth

82
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,519
But then as a local church has the responsibility of reaching their region

83
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,519
somehow Phoebe came into contact with the gospel and

84
00:06:54,359 --> 00:07:01,880
she trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior and thus we find that Paul would refer to her as

85
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Phoebe our

86
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,760
Sister we think about this truth

87
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:14,880
we often today even in 2021 will refer to our brothers and sisters in Christ as our church family and

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,959
At times we will even maybe refer to somebody as brother Michael. Why do we use that terminology?

89
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,480
Well, because Michael is trusted Christ as his Savior and I've trusted Christ as my Savior

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,720
And so we are brothers in Christ and I could go around the room and mention each person that has trusted Christ as their Savior

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,279
Individually and say sister so-and-so or brother so-and-so and it is an absolute blessing to be part of the family of God

92
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,399
amen, and what a joy what a

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,720
Bind that God brings in our lives as we are

94
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:55,720
One with another and we can have unity in Christ and we have that family

95
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,600
I remember the the testimony that was given a couple of Sunday nights ago

96
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:07,079
From sister matey with regard to her family and speaking about the church and how when they went to Texas and

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,959
They were there for a couple of years

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:16,440
but then to come back and she talked about her family her church family and what a blessing to be part of

99
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,480
the family of God and we find that Paul as

100
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,480
He's giving these opening statements in this last chapter of this powerful book of Romans

101
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,320
He introduces us to a character that we know very little about

102
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,840
But we observe first of all that she was

103
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,760
Converted if you've not been if you've not been saved this morning if you've never trusted Christ as your personal Savior

104
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Could I tell you that today is the day of salvation?

105
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Could I tell you that the Word of God says boast not thyself of tomorrow in in Proverbs 27 in verse number 1

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No man knoweth what a day

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,000
May bring the reality is that our days are short and we understand that eternity is long

108
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:07,000
Solomon made this statement that man goes to his long home and

109
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:15,559
This morning if you've not trusted Christ as your Savior as Paul said to the believers even in Corinth today is

110
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,799
the day of salvation

111
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,280
see

112
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,840
We sang that song when I see the blood

113
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,359
many of you know

114
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,520
that that particular song is

115
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:34,520
Referencing back to that event when the children of Israel were delivered from Egyptian bondage

116
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,760
the Passover and we understand that as we read about in the book of Exodus the way in which God gave the

117
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,559
instruction to Moses with regard to this final plague the death of the firstborn and the the process for

118
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
the the

119
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,640
Application of the blood and all that had to take place

120
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,880
We understand that God Almighty said that if the blood was not applied that there would be

121
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
the death of the firstborn.

122
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
And we understand that that information was communicated.

123
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm thankful over and over

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
as you study through the Pentateuch,

125
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,640
you find something just recurring about Moses,

126
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,520
and that is this, he was a faithful minister.

127
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,000
He delivered the word of God to the people of God,

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,240
and as he delivered the word of God to the people of God,

129
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,160
he told them, you have to take

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,040
and you have to make a sacrifice

131
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,440
and you have to get that blood

132
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,760
and you have to apply it to the doorpost and to the lintel,

133
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,320
because the firstborn's gonna die if not.

134
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,280
Now, the reality is that Moses couldn't make anyone do it.

135
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,640
They had to personally, willingly sacrifice that animal

136
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,120
and apply that blood.

137
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,120
They had to exercise faith in the word of God, amen?

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
They had to exercise faith.

139
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,040
They had to believe that what God said to Moses

140
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,560
and what Moses then communicated to them

141
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,720
would, in fact, happen.

142
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,560
And they exercised faith,

143
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,520
and their exercising of faith was applying that blood.

144
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,320
By the way, if in your mind's eye,

145
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,240
you could see blood on the sidepost and the lintel,

146
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
you can see a cross and the picture

147
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
that is given and presented to us,

148
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
and you would find that as you read

149
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,840
through the book of Exodus,

150
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,160
that when that death angel would come,

151
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,600
if there were blood, as the song says,

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I will pass, I will pass over you.

153
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Now, this morning, someone could have been as sincere

154
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,360
as they possibly think they could have been,

155
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
and they could have said,

156
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
well, I know that Moses said

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,040
we need to apply blood in this fashion,

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,000
but I really don't think it's necessary.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,920
I think if we just stay up all night and pray,

160
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,080
I think if we just try to help someone else,

161
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,320
I think if we do this, that, or the other,

162
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
that God will be merciful to me.

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,520
Death would come to that home,

164
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,680
and the firstborn would die.

165
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Why?

166
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,680
Because God said to apply the blood.

167
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
Amen?

168
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,000
The word of God tells us this morning

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,480
that there's but one way to be saved.

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,960
There's but one way to be converted.

171
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,120
It's through the blood of the Lamb.

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,720
Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

173
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,320
He went to that cruel cross.

174
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
We sang at the cross.

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
I mentioned when I prayed this morning,

176
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,279
I remember, Ms. Norma Jean, I think you were there.

177
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,279
Ms. Jackie was there.

178
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,480
Ms. Mona was there.

179
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,200
And we were at the nursing home.

180
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
It was one of the very early services

181
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,680
that I ever had at the nursing home.

182
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,160
And there was an elderly couple.

183
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,360
The wife was in terrible condition.

184
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,919
The man spent every day at that nursing home with his wife.

185
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,279
They were from India.

186
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,559
And we sang that song at the cross,

187
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,200
and he said this,

188
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Sir, what is meant by at the cross?

189
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,559
It was exciting to explain to him

190
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,880
what happened at the cross of Calvary

191
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,360
and how the God of the universe, Jesus Christ,

192
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,840
took our place willingly on that cruel cross.

193
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,440
He was buried in a borrowed tomb

194
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,240
and He rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

195
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
And I remember as I shared that truth

196
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,760
with that individual,

197
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,960
he had never understood before in his life

198
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,720
the truth of the gospel.

199
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,840
I wish I could tell you that he got saved that day,

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,760
but he didn't.

201
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,520
But we had opportunities month after month

202
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,680
after month after month

203
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,639
until his wife finally passed on into eternity,

204
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,559
that he faithfully came to our services

205
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,240
and he heard the word of God.

206
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
I had the privilege of speaking to him many times.

207
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,080
He never personally ever in my presence

208
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,919
told me that he trusted Christ,

209
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,720
but I could only hope that he,

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,040
having the knowledge and the understanding of the gospel,

211
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,760
has placed his faith and trust

212
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,440
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,120
Peter said, there's no other name under heaven

214
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,040
given among men whereby we must be saved.

215
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
Jesus Christ Himself said,

216
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

217
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,880
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

218
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,559
We understand this morning that Phoebe,

219
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,920
as Paul would refer to her, Phoebe, our sister,

220
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
she was born again.

221
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,279
She had been converted.

222
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
She had been washed in the blood.

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
She was redeemed and she was heaven-bound.

224
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,959
And that's wonderful for us to understand this morning.

225
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,520
And I hope this morning

226
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,679
that as we make this first observation

227
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,880
about this sister, Phoebe,

228
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,480
I hope that you can say with assurance that I'm converted.

229
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,679
I've been saved.

230
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,720
I have assurance that heaven is my home.

231
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,760
I mean, it's not a think so, hope so.

232
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
We'll see what happens.

233
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,279
It's a know so.

234
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,679
Jesus gave much truth in the New Testament

235
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,440
about the security of the believer.

236
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,800
In John chapter number 10, He said,

237
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,920
my sheep hear my voice and I know them

238
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,440
and I give unto them eternal life

239
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
and they shall never perish.

240
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh, I'm so thankful for that truth.

241
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,520
We find that John would say this in 1 John 5,

242
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,800
these things have I written unto you

243
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
that believe on the name of the Son of God

244
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
that you may know that you have eternal life.

245
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,800
Not that you might think, not that you might hope,

246
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,200
but that you might know that you have eternal life.

247
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,760
This morning, it's not about being sincere

248
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,320
in whatever your background might be.

249
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,119
It's not just being a good person,

250
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,119
giving to church, helping people.

251
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,480
It's about trusting the Lord Jesus Christ

252
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
as your personal Savior.

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,559
There's one way God said to get to heaven.

254
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,440
Jesus is the only way.

255
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
And I'm so thankful for that truth.

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,800
You understand that truth is under attack this morning.

257
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,760
There's a huge Baptist church.

258
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,360
I don't even know why they call themselves Baptist

259
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,320
in New York City that has thousands of people

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,880
and the pastor of that church stood in the pulpit

261
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,880
and said this idea of Jesus being the only way is nonsense.

262
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,040
And the people in the church applauded

263
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,119
and hooped and hollered when he made that statement.

264
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm sorry, but we're not seeking to be politically

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,679
or religiously correct.

266
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,800
We're seeking to be biblically correct.

267
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,119
And the Bible states that there's one way to be saved

268
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,399
and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

269
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,520
Are you converted?

270
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,160
Phoebe, our sister.

271
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,679
The first observation that we make

272
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,320
is that she was converted.

273
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I noticed this.

274
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,200
Not only was she converted, number two,

275
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,559
she was committed.

276
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,640
She was committed.

277
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,760
Notice what the Bible says of Phoebe, our sister.

278
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,600
Notice the next phrase in verse number one.

279
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
Paul says, I commend unto you, Phoebe, our sister,

280
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,959
which is a servant of the church, which is at Sancerre.

281
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,040
Now, as you think about this description of Phoebe,

282
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,940
not only being our sister that she was converted,

283
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,399
but you see that the Bible says that she is,

284
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,580
which is a servant of the church.

285
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm so thankful for the great privilege

286
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,200
that we have to be a servant of Jesus Christ.

287
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
What a joy that this individual, Phoebe,

288
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,760
that she was referred to by the apostle Paul

289
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,559
as being a servant of the church.

290
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,839
This morning as we would read our Bibles,

291
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,480
we would find that as we read a number

292
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,040
of the New Testament books,

293
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,640
that they will begin with the reference

294
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,440
of the name of the individual,

295
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,880
the human penman of that particular book,

296
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,480
and in many instances, you will find this reference,

297
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,559
a servant of Jesus Christ.

298
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,720
What a joy to be a servant of the Lord.

299
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,480
You know, here as we would think about

300
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,800
the service of Phoebe,

301
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,440
we don't know the exact content

302
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,959
in how she served the Lord.

303
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:46,179
We don't know the exact areas in which she served.

304
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,839
We don't know what her spiritual gift was,

305
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,760
but on the authority of the word of God,

306
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,520
we know that if she was a sister,

307
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,679
if she was converted, that she had a spiritual gift.

308
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,200
The Bible tells us that.

309
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,480
As every man hath received the gift.

310
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,160
In fact, in the book of 1 Corinthians,

311
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,640
there is much discussion about the gifts, right?

312
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,600
They were in competition, one with the other.

313
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,200
I have this spiritual gift,

314
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,360
and you have that spiritual gift,

315
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
and my spiritual gift is better than your spiritual gift,

316
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,279
and Paul tries to help all those folks out

317
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,559
to understand that we've each been equipped

318
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,480
as the Lord sees fit, amen?

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,679
We didn't get into a particular line when we got saved

320
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,239
and said, I think this gift is what would work for me.

321
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,200
No, no, we find the Holy Spirit of God

322
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,679
has gifted us as He will.

323
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,559
It's what the word of God says.

324
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,880
And as we would understand this morning

325
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
that this particular aspect of the service of Phoebe

326
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,280
is unknown, we don't know which area

327
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,400
or arena of service was hers,

328
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,200
but we know that she was known as being a servant.

329
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
And that's a great truth.

330
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
To be committed to the cause,

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,200
to understand that Jesus has saved me.

332
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,679
He's changed my life, and now I get to serve Him.

333
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,520
It's amazing that God would allow us to serve Him.

334
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,760
Turn over, hold your place here,

335
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,200
and turn to the book of Psalms,

336
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,720
and look at Psalm 100, if you will.

337
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,919
We are familiar with this short psalm,

338
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,160
and what a powerful psalm it is,

339
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,679
but we think about the truth this morning

340
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,039
with regard to being a servant of God,

341
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,440
and what a great privilege is ours.

342
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,280
The Bible says in Psalm 100, in verse number one,

343
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,320
"'Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.'"

344
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,760
Notice what it says,

345
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,960
"'Serve the Lord with gladness.

346
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,840
"'Come before His presence with singing.'"

347
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,160
Notice verse three,

348
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,599
"'Know ye that the Lord, He is God.

349
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,799
"'It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.

350
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,080
"'We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.

351
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,799
"'Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,

352
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,720
"'and into His courts with praise.

353
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,840
"'Be thankful unto Him,

354
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,640
and bless His name.

355
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,520
For the Lord is good.

356
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
His mercy is everlasting.

357
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,960
His truth endureth to all generations."

358
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
We find in verse 2

359
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
that the psalmist says,

360
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,700
serve the Lord, how?

361
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,520
With gladness.

362
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,600
We sing the song from time to time,

363
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,140
there is joy in serving Jesus.

364
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,480
And we think about the truth

365
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,760
of serve the Lord with gladness

366
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,400
and the privilege that we have.

367
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,240
Listen, when we understand who He is,

368
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,120
when we understand that He's the God of the universe,

369
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
when we understand that He saved me,

370
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
He redeemed me,

371
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,920
He paid for my sin debt,

372
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,680
He did for me what I could not do for myself,

373
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,480
what no one else could do for me,

374
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,520
it is an absolute joy to serve Him.

375
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,760
And he says, serve the Lord with gladness.

376
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,880
Listen, it ought never be a drudgery to serve God.

377
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,080
It ought never be a,

378
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,440
it's my week to clean the church.

379
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,120
It's my week to cut the grass.

380
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,640
It's my week to,

381
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
I get in trouble that Mr. Don's

382
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
not on the cutting schedule enough.

383
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
I called him to ask him to cut the grass.

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,680
He said, I thought you forgot about me.

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Isn't that what he said, Mr. Normagene?

386
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,640
You ain't asked me to cut the grass yet, right?

387
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,320
I like that he wants to do it.

388
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,280
Brother Don, how old are you?

389
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,680
How old is he, 87?

390
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,920
He'll be 89 in November.

391
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,840
I had to call the foreman

392
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
for the parsonage project on Wednesday

393
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,000
and say, hey, listen, I got an elderly fellow

394
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,280
that's gonna come cut the grass.

395
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,520
I want you to make sure the hose is out of the way

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,720
because he'll just run that thing over, amen?

397
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,800
I said, so make sure that hose is out of the way.

398
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
And here's what I said.

399
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,320
I said, the fellow that's gonna cut the grass

400
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,160
is well in his 80s.

401
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,680
And I said, I just appreciate his willingness to serve.

402
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,240
And he said, did you say in his 80s?

403
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,960
I did.

404
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Listen, commitment is required in serving God.

405
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,840
But can I tell you that

406
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
you're not gonna regret serving God?

407
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,640
And God knows your motives.

408
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
We're to serve Him with gladness.

409
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,880
It's not out of duty.

410
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,040
It's a, I get to do this.

411
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,480
I can't fully comprehend how amazing

412
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,800
of a privilege it is to be a pastor, honestly.

413
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
That literally, God has called me to be in this position.

414
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,960
It's unbelievable.

415
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,440
It causes me to rejoice greatly.

416
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
There are times in which I just simply,

417
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,040
God, I just don't understand it,

418
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,040
but thank you for allowing me to serve in this capacity.

419
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,600
And there are times when you get together

420
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
at some pastors' conferences

421
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,240
and you're speaking with other pastors

422
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,280
and there's some that you don't wanna be around too much

423
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,280
because they're kinda just, woe is me.

424
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,920
You know, everything's hard, everything's tough,

425
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,040
everything's difficult, it's terrible.

426
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,320
But then there's a group of pastors

427
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,040
that, man, they just have that perspective

428
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,400
that, isn't it wonderful serving Jesus?

429
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,640
I'd rather do nothing else.

430
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
What a joy it is to serve the Lord.

431
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,480
Not only was Phoebe converted, but she was committed.

432
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,720
The Bible tells us in Ephesians chapter number two,

433
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,160
a great verse of scripture to really contain

434
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,480
and really look at these first two points together.

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,640
In Ephesians chapter number two,

436
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
I'm gonna go ahead and take the time

437
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,320
to read the first 10 verses because it's so powerful.

438
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,160
In Ephesians chapter number two,

439
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,840
verses nine and eight through 10

440
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,760
are the real focus of these two points,

441
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,200
but I want you to gather it in context.

442
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,480
In Ephesians two and verse number one,

443
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,280
the Bible says, and you hath he quickened

444
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,400
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

445
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,080
See, we were dead in trespasses and sins.

446
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,280
We were dead spiritually.

447
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,640
We're needed to be saved and redeemed.

448
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
And we talked about she was converted.

449
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,840
The Bible says in verse number two,

450
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,400
wherein in time past you walked

451
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
according to the course of this world,

452
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
according to the prince of the power of the air,

453
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,440
the spirit that now worketh

454
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
in the children of disobedience,

455
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,840
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past

456
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,160
in the lust of our flesh,

457
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,580
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,

458
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,620
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

459
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,080
You understand, according to truth of verse number three,

460
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,580
the Bible says among whom also we all

461
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,400
had our conversation in times past.

462
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,740
At some point in our life, we were lost.

463
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,420
Maybe somebody here this morning

464
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,100
or somebody that's watching live stream

465
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,980
is still lost this morning.

466
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,740
They've never been converted.

467
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,940
There was a time in my life that I was lost.

468
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,420
There was a time in each individual

469
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,020
that's here this morning that they were lost.

470
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,820
But if they've trusted Christ as their Savior,

471
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,260
they've been converted as Phoebe was,

472
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,460
then death passed unto life, amen?

473
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,420
We had peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ,

474
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,740
and we were redeemed.

475
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,940
And we find that this morning,

476
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,520
if you are still dead in your trespasses and sins,

477
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,620
notice the truth of verse number four,

478
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,300
but God who is rich in mercy

479
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,840
for his great love wherewith he loved us.

480
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,840
I'm so thankful for God's mercy and for God's love.

481
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
It says in verse number five,

482
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,160
even when we were dead in sins,

483
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,020
hath quickened us together with Christ by grace,

484
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,080
you're saved.

485
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,000
We've now read about the mercy, the love,

486
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,580
and grace of God Almighty.

487
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,320
I'm so thankful that our God is gracious

488
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,520
and merciful and loving.

489
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,160
But you understand this morning that our God is just.

490
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,640
He's just.

491
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,960
And his justice requires

492
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,120
that mankind is either redeemed,

493
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,360
and the wrath of God was poured on Jesus Christ

494
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,140
at the cross of Calvary,

495
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,300
or mankind that does not trust Christ as their Savior

496
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,080
will spend eternity in the lake of fire.

497
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,360
You say, that's harsh.

498
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,800
It's unfortunate, but it's the truth of the word of God.

499
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,480
The Bible says the wages of sin is death,

500
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,600
but the gift of God is eternal life

501
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,520
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

502
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,720
We find here that it says in verse number six,

503
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,160
and hath raised us up together and made us sit together

504
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,560
in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

505
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,680
that in the ages to come he might show

506
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,080
the exceeding riches of his grace

507
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,240
in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

508
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,760
Notice verse eight and nine.

509
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,640
For by grace are you saved through faith,

510
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
and that not of yourselves,

511
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
it is the gift of God,

512
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,440
not of works, lest any man should boast.

513
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,360
You say, well, I hear what you're saying, preacher,

514
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,760
but I'm gonna just try to get there myself.

515
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
It ain't gonna work.

516
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,560
I mean, I'm not trying to be unkind,

517
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm not trying to spoil your day,

518
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,960
but on the authority of the word of God,

519
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
you cannot get there on your own.

520
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,920
It's not by works of our righteousness

521
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,280
what Titus says in chapter three and verse number five.

522
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,040
Notice it says, and that not of yourselves.

523
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,760
But I'm a good person.

524
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,520
There's none good, no not one.

525
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,080
And you say, how can you say that?

526
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,560
Well, because you say you're a good person

527
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,720
when you compare yourself to your neighbor.

528
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,000
But you understand that the true comparison

529
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,520
that would have to be made is with the Lord Jesus Christ.

530
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
And all of our righteousness, as Isaiah said,

531
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,560
are as filthy rags.

532
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,560
We need to be clothed in the righteousness of Christ.

533
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
And that's the conversion.

534
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,400
But then we see in verse number 10,

535
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,400
it says, we are, for we are His workmanship

536
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,520
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

537
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,800
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

538
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,840
So we find that here, Paul is referring to salvation

539
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,640
in these first nine verses.

540
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,760
And then he's speaking about our service in verse number 10,

541
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,120
that we are His workmanship and that we are created

542
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,480
in Christ Jesus unto good works.

543
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,920
Listen, this morning, good works cannot save you.

544
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,520
It's very plain that it says in verse number nine,

545
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,720
not of works, but I will say this,

546
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,320
that if you are saved this morning,

547
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,880
that good works will follow your salvation.

548
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Why?

549
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,440
Because you're a servant of Jesus Christ.

550
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,240
You're committed to serving God as Phoebe is.

551
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,080
Why?

552
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,360
Because we've been saved.

553
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,080
We've been born again.

554
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,520
And now these good works will follow.

555
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,480
Understand this morning that the good works can't save you.

556
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,040
The good works can't keep you saved,

557
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,120
but the good works are the result of your salvation.

558
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,520
I noticed this morning I moved the church van.

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,920
I had it parked in the corner over here last week

560
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
while we were away.

561
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,320
And I went to move the church van this morning

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,360
to free up another parking spot.

563
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,680
And as I did, I noticed the beautiful roses

564
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
that line the side of the property

565
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,240
right there in the corner.

566
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,400
How many of you noticed the roses this morning we came in?

567
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
I mean, they're just beautiful.

568
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
What is that rose?

569
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,280
It shows us, it reveals to us that there's a root system

570
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,240
that's working, right?

571
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,240
And the flower is the fruit of that root system

572
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,480
working properly.

573
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,559
And so this morning, when we think about salvation,

574
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,880
when we think about service,

575
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,800
we understand that we are saved completely

576
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,760
by the grace of God.

577
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,800
For by grace are you saved through faith.

578
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,400
And the root of our salvation is in Jesus Christ,

579
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
the grace of God.

580
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,440
But the fruit, as James often talks about, are works.

581
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,640
That's the commitment that we see of Phoebe

582
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,559
here in verse number two, excuse me,

583
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,400
verse number.

584
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,080
1 of Romans 16. We notice that she was converted, but she was also committed. Go

585
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,160
back to Romans 16, if you will, and let's look at a couple other observations, or

586
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,360
make a couple of other observations from this text of Scripture. We notice, first

587
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,320
of all, that she was converted. We notice, number two, that she was committed. She

588
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,400
was a servant of the church. We notice, number three, the third observation that

589
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,320
we make, according to verse number two, is that she was compassionate. She was

590
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,640
compassionate. Notice what the Bible says in verse number two, that you receive

591
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,800
her in the Lord as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in what sort of

592
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,440
business she hath need of you. Notice this, for she, speaking of Phoebe, she hath

593
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,040
been a suckerer of many, and of myself also. Now, that word is a word that we do

594
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,160
not use very often in our vocabulary today, but really it means to

595
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,480
be a helper, a sucker, a helper, one that assists, one that helps, and we would find

596
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,200
that as she would help, it reveals to us that she has compassion, and that

597
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,400
she was compassionate. I'm thankful that as we would look at the Word of God, and

598
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,760
we would understand that our God, as we look to in Ephesians 2, is merciful, and

599
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,080
gracious, and loving, and kind, but we understand that God is compassionate.

600
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,180
Often, as you read through the gospel accounts, you'll read of Jesus that he

601
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:32,180
was moved with compassion on them, and here we find that Phoebe, I would say

602
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,460
that as the Bible says that she was hath been a suckerer of many, that she was

603
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,580
compassionate. Notice that she was compassionate towards the brethren. It

604
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,940
says here that she had been hath been a suckerer of many. Now, we don't know who

605
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,260
all of these people are. Paul's writing about somebody that he knows. No doubt

606
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,900
the people that he's writing to are gonna learn some things about Phoebe, as

607
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,820
this introduction is given in verses 1 and 2 about receiving her, as the Bible

608
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,380
says there in verse number 2. She's traveling, and she's going to be there. We

609
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,060
don't know even for how long she'll be there, but Paul is commending her, and

610
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,140
he's giving this word of information to the believers at Rome, and he says

611
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,980
that she hath been a suckerer of many. Now, think about that. Think about being

612
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,940
compassionate, being helpful, and being a help, a helper. I'm thankful this morning

613
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,580
that God is our helper. I will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence

614
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,540
cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth. But you

615
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,060
understand that as believers that we, too, have the privilege of being helpers?

616
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,260
The Bible speaks of, Paul talks about, being a fellow helper, a fellow laborer.

617
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,820
And we think about being a helper, coming alongside and assisting someone. I think

618
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,020
about what Paul said to the believers in Corinth, and you don't need to turn there,

619
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,540
but in 2 Corinthians chapter number 1, the Bible talks about God being our

620
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,260
comforter, and it says this in verse number 3 of 2 Corinthians 1,

621
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,460
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies

622
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,900
and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation. Notice that we

623
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,140
may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we

624
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,700
ourselves are comforted of God. And so God will allow, He will comfort us, and

625
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,940
then He'll allow us to be a comfort to others. And so as God helps us, He'll

626
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,100
allow us to help others, to lead them in truth. I think about the passage of

627
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,260
Scripture that was preached on Sunday evening from Acts chapter number 8. You

628
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,460
think about Acts 8 and the way in which Philip was given that responsibility to

629
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,900
go in to the Ethiopian eunuch, and he says, Understandest thou what thou readest?

630
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,180
Is that not what Philip asked him? And you know what the response of the eunuch

631
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:09,220
was? How can I, except some man should guide me? Philip was a help. Amen? I mean,

632
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,500
he saw that man trust Christ as his Savior. He was active in giving the

633
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,300
truth and helping that man understanding the truth of what he read from the book

634
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,740
of Isaiah. Who's this man speaking of, himself or some other? And then what'd he

635
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,460
do? He preached Christ unto him because it's a prophecy of the Lord Jesus Christ.

636
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,460
And so we find this morning that she, Phoebe, she was compassionate. She had

637
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,980
been a sucker of many. But then notice the last line of verse number 2 in

638
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:45,140
Romans 16. The Bible says this, And of myself also. Paul says this. He says,

639
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:52,020
Listen, not only has Phoebe helped many, but she helped me. Now think about Paul. I

640
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,740
mean, we know Paul. We understand God has given us much in the Word of God about

641
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,300
Paul, and we read much about his ministry and all of those things, and we have the

642
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,140
privilege of reading about those that were his fellow helpers and his fellow

643
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,740
laborers, and we get to read about those that he went on missionary journeys with.

644
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,740
And then as we come to Romans 16, we're introduced to someone that we know very

645
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,820
little about, but we find that as we read these two verses and we make these

646
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,340
observations, that Paul reveals to us that she has been a helper. She was

647
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:30,420
compassionate even to me, and of me, of myself also. Look over to the book of

648
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:38,060
Galatians in chapter number 6, if you will. Galatians chapter number 6.

649
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,220
Galatians chapter number 6 and verse number 2. The Bible says this, Bear ye

650
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:58,060
one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. Bear ye one another's

651
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:04,140
burdens. We understand this morning that there are a number of one another

652
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,340
commands in the New Testament with regard to believers as the family of

653
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,220
God, and the way that we interact one with another. We provoke one another into

654
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,260
good works, and we read about these one another commands, and that's why it's so

655
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,780
important that the church assembles. Amen? That we're able to fulfill those

656
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,900
commandments that God has given us. And we find here that in Romans 6 and verse

657
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:35,740
number 2, it says, Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

658
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,500
Listen, I'm so thankful that we have the privilege of meeting in person. The last

659
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,580
year has been a very interesting year. There's been many attacks and many

660
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,900
things that have happened, no doubt, in opposition to the work of God, and

661
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,380
there's absolutely a spiritual aspect to all the things that have happened in the

662
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,540
last year. I've gone by places where I read on signs where it says that they

663
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:05,900
have preschool open, church online. I'm thankful that we have online ministry,

664
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,220
but the church is supposed to assemble. We're to bear one another's burdens. How

665
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:19,460
was Phoebe a suckerer of many, and of Paul also? And they were they were

666
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,620
gathering together, they were meeting together, they were helping one another.

667
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:30,020
We read that this sister, Phoebe, she was compassionate. 1st Peter chapter number

668
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:37,540
4. Notice what the Word of God says here with regard to this same idea of being

669
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:46,820
compassionate, being a servant. In 1st Peter chapter number 4, I referenced

670
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,860
though we didn't turn here, verse number 10 a moment ago, that every man hath

671
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,900
received the gift, that if she was converted that she had been equipped

672
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,660
with a spiritual gift. You find that in 1st Peter 4 and verse number 10, but I

673
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,020
want you to notice verses 8 and 9 with regard to this idea of being

674
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,740
compassionate. The Bible says in verse number 8, and above all things, have

675
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,620
fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of

676
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:19,180
sins. Use hospitality one to another without grudging. You look at these two

677
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,460
verses of Scripture and you think about the fervent charity that we have among

678
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,260
ourselves. Remember it was the Lord Jesus Christ in John 13 that said, a new

679
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,020
commandment I give unto you that you love one another. And he said, as I have

680
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,940
loved you. Right? He said, by this, by what? By your love one for another shall all

681
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,540
men know that you're my disciples. That we have fervent charity among ourselves.

682
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,059
Notice verse number 9, that we use hospitality one to another. If you

683
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,700
understand anything about the time in which the New Testament was written, you

684
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,940
understand that there was much persecution and there were various

685
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,020
places and aspects in which an individual that trusted Christ as their

686
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,140
Savior, they would be absolutely excluded from the community. And many times even

687
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,740
happens still around the globe in some of the countries where we have

688
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,380
missionaries where an individual that trusts Christ as their Savior will be

689
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:22,300
excommunicated from their family. And guess what? They have a new family, the

690
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,420
family of God. The brothers and sisters in Christ. And they're to have fervent

691
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,260
charity one toward another. They're to use hospitality one toward another. You

692
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,740
read about Gaius, as John would refer to Gaius, and you believe or you begin to

693
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:44,020
understand about the the way in which John will reference this individual and

694
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:51,180
this servant of the Lord and how he was a man that showed compassion. He was a

695
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,340
man that showed hospitality. As we think of Phoebe this morning, we make these

696
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,380
observations from Romans 16, we notice number one that

697
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,700
she was converted. If you're not converted this morning, if you've not trusted Christ,

698
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:13,980
would you trust Christ today? What's holding you back? Today is the day of salvation. She

699
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:20,840
was committed. You know, you've got to be committed to serve God. We were down in the

700
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,860
Outer Banks and the pool water was a little bit cold, really, you know, the ocean. And

701
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,740
my brother, he just kept doing this, right? He goes, man, it's kind of cold, you know?

702
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,020
Kind of cold. Just kind of touching the water with his toe. I said, brother, you just got

703
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:48,140
to jump in. You just got to jump in. And so I'm the older brother and I said, do I have

704
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,340
to help you like I did when we were kids? Yeah, I just kind of messed around. Getting

705
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,980
the little nephews and nieces to laugh and all that sort of thing. I just jumped in.

706
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:05,580
Just go in. Listen. When you think about serving God, just get in. Just be committed to serving

707
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:17,380
Christ. Say, as Isaiah did, here am I. Send me. What can I do to serve God? She was compassionate.

708
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:24,740
Oh, that we would be compassionate one toward another. There would not be divisions and

709
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,780
all of those types of things that we see in the church in Corinth, but there would be

710
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:37,780
compassion, fervent charity amongst the brethren. The final observation that I make, number

711
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,420
four in your notes, it actually goes back to the first statement of Romans 16 in verse

712
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:52,980
number one. She was commended. She was commended. Notice that Paul begins this chapter by saying,

713
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:04,260
I commend unto you, Phoebe, our sister. This commendation that she received, I think is

714
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:12,820
of great value for us to understand and recognize that this sister Phoebe had a God honoring

715
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:22,940
testimony and Paul informed the believers at Rome about her and said, I commend. I commend

716
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:31,500
unto you, Phoebe, our sister. To me, that's impactful. That under the inspiration of the

717
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,900
Holy Spirit of God, that the Apostle Paul as the human penman would say, I commend unto

718
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:46,700
you, Phoebe, our sister. That's a great testimony that someone could make a recommendation.

719
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:53,260
I commend unto you her. Have you ever recommended anyone before and then regretted it? When

720
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:59,340
I was in Bible college, I made a recommendation for someone. I did. He wanted to get a job

721
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,340
at the place where I was employed. I didn't really know him very well, but I talked to

722
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,620
the manager and said, oh, yeah, he's a great guy. Hire him, whatever. I was just going

723
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,620
off of a few things that I understood and it came back to hurt me because that individual

724
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:19,380
was not a good worker. It came back to hurt me. But Paul, under the inspiration of the

725
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:28,620
Holy Spirit of God, the Apostle Paul, he says, I commend unto you, Phoebe, our sister. Wow.

726
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:38,580
Do we have the kind of testimony that someone could commend us, that God would commend us?

727
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:43,820
We speak about the truth of the Gospel, the Bible says, as we would enter into His presence,

728
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,740
well done, thou good and faithful servant. And this morning as we look at Phoebe, our

729
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:59,980
sister, and we think about the application of these four observations, it's really truth

730
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:09,820
that each one of us can take with us. It starts with conversion. That's the starting point.

731
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:16,460
Starts with conversion, being converted, being saved, born again. Listen, you're never going

732
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,820
to be able to fulfill the role of being a mother or any other role that God has in your

733
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:29,220
life without God's help. And we get that help by being His children or His child, is trusting

734
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:37,700
Him as our Savior, being converted. But not only was she converted, we understand that

735
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:44,339
she was committed. Are you committed to serving God? Or is it just kind of like a, if it's

736
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:49,580
convenient for me, if it's something... I remember talking to a man many, many years

737
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,820
ago, 15 years ago. He came to me, or he actually went to the pastor of the church and said

738
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,739
he wanted to serve God. And so the pastor came to me and said, hey, so-and-so wants

739
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,779
to serve, he came and talked to me and I want you to help him and get him in this position,

740
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:04,660
that position. There were a couple of ministries that I was overseeing at our church at that

741
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,380
particular time. And I went to that individual and I said, well, there's a Sunday school

742
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,700
class over here and we really need an assistant, we need a helper in this class, and that's

743
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,739
an opportunity. There's also a bus route over here that we're operating and we need another

744
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:24,580
worker on that bus route and it would be great if you want to help in that capacity. And

745
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,779
this individual had been saved for a short period of time. I was actually discipling

746
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:32,820
them. They'd been saved for a short period of time, never taught, no real experience.

747
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,540
And those were the two options of ministry opportunities that I presented. And he looked

748
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:44,540
at me as serious as could be and said, I want to teach the pastor's class. And I said,

749
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,860
I'm not sure that's available. And he said, well, then I'm not interested in those things.

750
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:59,220
That was really sad for that individual. See, it's a privilege to serve God. Are we committed

751
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:06,200
to serving God? Are we compassionate? Our God is compassionate and we as His children

752
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,279
were to be Christ-like, so we're to be compassionate. And then do we have the kind of testimony

753
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:17,640
that Phoebe had, which as we look at those three observations, makes sense to us why

754
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,920
Paul says, I commend unto you, Phoebe, our sister. Why does he commend her? Because she

755
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,059
was converted, committed, and compassionate. And therefore, Paul could make this commendation

756
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:35,839
upon Phoebe, our sister. This morning, I trust that the Word of God has been a help to us,

757
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:43,360
a challenge to us. And I hope that we'd respond, that we would take whatever of those points

758
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,440
that would be most appropriate or applicable in our lives and say, okay, that's what I

759
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,920
need to work on. That's where the Holy Spirit of God spoke to my heart about this area.

760
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
And that's what I need to get settled. That's what I need to take care of. Whichever of

761
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,880
those points it is, would you let God have His way? Would you say as we sing the song,

762
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,880
not all the time, but we sing it often, I'll say, yes, Lord, yes, to your will and to your

763
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,760
way. I'll say, yes, Lord, yes, I will trust you and obey. When your Spirit speaks to me,

764
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:25,600
with my whole heart, I'll agree. And my answer will be, yes, Lord, yes. We serve a great

765
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,860
God. It's such a privilege to serve Him. Phoebe, our sister. Let's pray. Father, we love you

766
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,020
this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege of having the

767
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,739
opportunity to gather together. We thank you for the Word of God and the truth contained

768
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:51,260
therein. We thank you for the testimony of Phoebe and how we are challenged by her testimony.

769
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,820
And I pray this morning that you'd use your Word as only you can. We pray that the Holy

770
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,360
Spirit would convict and work in the heart of each individual that's here this morning.

771
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,880
Maybe there's one that needs to be converted. Oh, God, would you help them to understand

772
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,679
their need for Christ? They would not leave this place without knowing for sure that heaven

773
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:23,440
is their home. Maybe there's one that's just not been committed. They have felt the Spirit

774
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,679
of God prompt their heart with regard to commitment to service. Maybe we lack compassion.

775
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:38,359
Lord, whichever area it is, I pray that you'd work and have your will in our lives. I pray

776
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:44,320
that as we have these moments of invitation, that we'd do business with you, that we'd

777
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:52,720
respond as we should. We pray that the decisions that are made are not made out of emotion,

778
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,520
but the decisions are made based upon the truth of thy Word. They would be decisions

779
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,919
that would endure. We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory for all that you'll

780
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:08,039
do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are

781
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:13,239
closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar is open.

782
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:17,200
You can make your seat an altar. You can come to this old-fashioned altar. If you're not

783
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,640
sure of heaven, would you let us take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that

784
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,000
heaven is your home? It'd be our great privilege to be able to do so. As Kimberly plays, the

785
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,880
altar is open.
