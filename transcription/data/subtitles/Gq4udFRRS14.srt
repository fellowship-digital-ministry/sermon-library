1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
First chapter number 21, and we'll be looking specifically

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,679
at verses four through nine.

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,760
It'll be a familiar passage of scripture for you

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,880
in those verses, but I trust that as we go to the word

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,460
of God this morning, and though the passage is familiar,

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,159
we understand that the lessons are valuable,

7
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:18,579
and I trust that that would be the case this morning.

8
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,219
As you read through the book of Numbers,

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,440
you will learn of the wilderness wanderings,

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,680
and you'll read about the children of Israel

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,079
as they're led by the Lord through the wilderness,

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,979
and of course, we understand that it was God's plan

13
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:32,459
to deliver them from Egypt and to take them

14
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:35,060
to the land of promise, but because of their unbelief

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,659
and their unwillingness to obey and to live by faith,

16
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,220
we find that they wandered there in the wilderness,

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,240
and we find that as we study through the book of Numbers,

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,299
there are several specific accounts

19
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,740
that God provides us with that help us understand

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,299
the importance of faith and obedience,

21
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,500
and we find that as we look at this particular book

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,900
and think about the content of the book of Numbers,

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,259
we are mindful of the fact that God

24
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,860
is leading the children of Israel.

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,580
We understand that Moses is the human leader,

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,139
but we are aware of the fact that God,

27
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:15,059
after the Passover, that he led his people

28
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:19,500
with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,800
and we understand the leadership that God provided.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,500
By the way, aren't you thankful for God's leadership?

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm thankful that today, though we do not have

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,760
a pillar of cloud by day or a pillar of fire by night,

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,199
we have the complete canon of scripture.

34
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,559
We have the word of God.

35
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,440
As New Testament believers, we have the Holy Spirit of God

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
who indwells us, and the scriptures tell us

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,800
that he will guide us into all truth,

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,779
and I am so thankful for God's leadership

39
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,959
and his direction in our lives.

40
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,000
We find that as we come to Numbers 21,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
the beginning of the chapter opens up

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,239
with providing us with a record of Israel's victory

43
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:58,400
over King Arad and the Canaanites.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,879
The Bible tells us, and when King Arad, the Canaanite,

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,480
which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,419
came by the way of the spies, then he fought against Israel

47
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,059
and took some of them prisoners.

48
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:13,479
We find that it's a very quick record that is provided,

49
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,000
but the children of Israel have victory,

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,479
for it tells us in verse number three

51
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,240
that the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel.

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,399
You can read their vow in verse number two,

53
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,320
and delivered up the Canaanites,

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,899
and so we find that Numbers 21 begins

55
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,059
with a record of victory.

56
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:32,179
We end the 21st chapter of the book of Numbers

57
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,779
in verse 10 all the way down through the end of the chapter

58
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,460
in verse number 35, and you'll read there

59
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,220
that God provides us with the record

60
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,179
of Israel's victory over Sihon and Og.

61
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,059
And so as we look at Numbers chapter 21,

62
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,259
it's a very interesting chapter in the word of God,

63
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,460
for you find that it begins with victory

64
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,600
and it ends with victory, but in these few verses,

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,580
these handful of verses that I wanna focus

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,259
our attention on this morning,

67
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,660
we find that God provides us in between

68
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,179
these great victories, really the failure of his people

69
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:07,179
and the judgment, and we look and we see

70
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,460
the record of those fiery serpents.

71
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,160
And it's very interesting to me how that you would read

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,479
in verses four through nine of these fiery serpents,

73
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,820
and you would read of the sin of the people,

74
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,740
the complaining of the people, and all that takes place,

75
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,320
and you would be mindful of the fact of the victory

76
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,559
that had just taken place at the beginning of the chapter.

77
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,440
We find that as you would study through the word of God,

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,639
that oftentimes you will find that God's people

79
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,559
become greatly vulnerable to the attack of the enemy

80
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:43,399
in times of victory, in times of victory.

81
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,919
It's in those times of victory that we can become

82
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,820
self-sufficient, self-dependent, we can come to the place

83
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,119
where we feel like we can handle this,

84
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,520
and we come to a place where we begin to think

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,960
that we may know more, that we may have a better plan,

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,279
and we find that in this particular chapter

87
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,559
that it was the plan that God had for the children of Israel

88
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:07,020
that they complained about the direction and the provision

89
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,080
that he had provided them with,

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,000
and we find that they complained about that.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,440
I'll take some time this morning to go through the nine,

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
these verses, verses four through nine,

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,279
provide you with some, an outline if you will,

94
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,160
but at the end of the message, and really the bulk

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,480
of the message this morning, I wanna focus upon Moses.

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,480
And I wanna look at the behavior of Moses

97
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,959
as it's provided to us here in this portion of scripture,

98
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,959
and trust that God would use his behavior and his example

99
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,760
to encourage us and to challenge us

100
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
in our own walk with God.

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,959
We find that in verse number seven, excuse me,

102
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,440
in verse number, let's see, verse number seven,

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,559
it says at the end of the verse,

104
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:51,000
and Moses prayed for the people,

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
and you see that we've used that title this morning,

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,279
Moses prayed for the people.

107
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,119
I want you to just take a quick outline

108
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,679
of the passage of scripture.

109
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,660
Notice with me number one, if you would,

110
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,480
consider the problem.

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,679
In verses four through six, God reveals to us

112
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,000
the problem that they encounter here.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,359
The Bible says in verse number four,

114
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,160
and they, the children of Israel,

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,600
they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,959
to compass the land of Edom,

117
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,980
and the soul of the people was much discouraged

118
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,100
because of the way.

119
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,619
I want you to think about verse number four here

120
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:28,820
and understand as we begin to dig into the problem

121
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,660
and we wanna be able to identify the cause of the problem,

122
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,059
if we were to say in this passage of scripture

123
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,359
that the problem is the fiery serpents,

124
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,299
then how did that come about?

125
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,059
Why did these fiery serpents come?

126
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:43,019
We find that the Bible begins to reveal to us

127
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,940
in verse number four about their journey,

128
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,660
the details concerning the path

129
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,700
that God would lead them on.

130
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,420
The Bible tells us that they journeyed from Mount Hor

131
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,420
by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom,

132
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,559
and we find that God reveals to us here

133
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,600
the direction that He's providing them with.

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,059
Again, by way of introduction, I made note

135
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:07,140
that the fact that God is the one

136
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,000
providing them with leadership.

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,619
It is God that is leading them and directing them.

138
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:16,220
Yes, Moses is the human leader of the children of Israel,

139
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,820
but God is providing that direction.

140
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,940
The Bible ends in verse number four with this note,

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,820
the soul of the people was much discouraged

142
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
because of the way.

143
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,459
You know, if we're not careful in our lives,

144
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,859
we can get discouraged because of the way, the journey.

145
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,540
It may not be the exact path

146
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,760
that we had laid out for ourselves.

147
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,899
It might not be the plan that we develop,

148
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,040
the plan that we think,

149
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,380
but we understand that God is sovereign

150
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,739
and God has a plan and God is the one

151
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,260
providing the leadership,

152
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,519
and if we're not careful this morning,

153
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,619
we can become discouraged just like the people.

154
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,859
Notice what happens after their heart is discouraged,

155
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,619
after the soul of the people was much discouraged

156
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:06,540
because of the way.

157
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,619
Notice how that they responded

158
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,220
to that measure of discouragement,

159
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,299
and by the way, understand this morning

160
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,700
that discouragement is unfortunate

161
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,739
and we find that many people in our society today

162
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,220
deal with disappointment and discouragement,

163
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,100
but how we respond in times of discouragement.

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,779
Notice, this is a poor example

165
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,980
of responding in time of discouragement.

166
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,500
The people, they spake against God.

167
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,959
Wow.

168
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,459
You say, I'd never do that.

169
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,779
Maybe not out loud.

170
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,619
Right?

171
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,339
They spake against God.

172
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,059
And the Bible says against Moses.

173
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,480
Their response was to speak against the Lord,

174
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,260
to question perhaps His goodness,

175
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,940
to question His understanding,

176
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,619
to question the direction in which they led them.

177
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,859
As they would be here in this desert place,

178
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,440
as they would be here in this difficult place,

179
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,179
we find that they respond to that way

180
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,980
that they were led by speaking against God

181
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,579
and against Moses, and notice what they say.

182
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,420
Notice their complaint.

183
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,859
It says, wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt

184
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:25,220
to die in the wilderness?

185
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,260
By the way, is not this a recurring theme

186
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,700
for the children of Israel?

187
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,579
They often would say, in fact,

188
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,280
immediately before they ever crossed the Red Sea,

189
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,179
when they're facing the Red Sea

190
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,320
and the Egyptians are in hot pursuit behind them,

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,700
they say that God led us here to die

192
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,020
because there weren't enough graves over in Egypt.

193
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,380
We find that they continue with this thought, this theme,

194
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,539
and they not only say that,

195
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,320
but I want you to notice how that their complaint,

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,419
what are they complaining about?

197
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,780
Number one, the direction that God provided,

198
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,460
but also they're complaining about God's provision.

199
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,219
Notice what they say.

200
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:07,859
And they say this, for there is no bread.

201
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,340
Now, is that true or false?

202
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,059
It's false.

203
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,479
They even say at the end of their statement,

204
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,780
after they say there is no bread,

205
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,539
they say, and our soul loatheth this light bread.

206
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,580
They've been deceived.

207
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,099
Their complaint about the provision.

208
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,500
I want you to think about this bread

209
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,780
that they refer to as light bread.

210
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,020
I want you to think about the provision of God,

211
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,260
the miraculous provision of God.

212
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,340
This is manna.

213
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,979
And God would rain down manna for them.

214
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,580
And it was so interesting.

215
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,840
They would go out and they would gather the manna

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,419
and they would have sufficient.

217
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,059
And of course, if they gathered more

218
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:54,940
than they were supposed to

219
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,299
and they tried to store it overnight,

220
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,340
those first days, what would happen?

221
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,299
Man, it would rot, it would grow worms.

222
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,019
stink, but we find that on day number six, they're to go out and they're to gather twice

223
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,499
as much.

224
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,859
Why?

225
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:14,859
For God was not going to send the manna on the Sabbath, and we find that there were some

226
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,659
that they did not gather twice as much.

227
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,139
They went out and they tried to find it and there was none.

228
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,139
Why?

229
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:27,639
They didn't follow the direction, but God miraculously had provided this manna.

230
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,839
It's His sustenance for His people.

231
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,079
It's His provision, and they're complaining about God's provision.

232
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:43,519
And then they say this, neither is there any water.

233
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:53,119
Now when they first leave Egypt, they come to a place of bitter water.

234
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:58,759
God miraculously heals those waters so that they could drink.

235
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:06,639
We find that they then would come to a place where there's no water, and what did God do?

236
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,519
He told Moses where to go and told him about a rock and told him to smite the rock and

237
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
waters would gush out, and what happened?

238
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,399
God provided water.

239
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,359
I mean, the miraculous provision of God.

240
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:24,359
Listen, the truth of the matter, Matthew tells us in the sixth chapter that God knows what

241
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,039
we have need of.

242
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,119
God knows our needs.

243
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:32,359
He's formed us, He's made us, and He knows what we need, and He graciously provides for

244
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,359
us.

245
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:39,079
And we find here that the children of Israel, the problem that is here, that they are complaining

246
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,239
about the direction that God has provided.

247
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:47,799
They're complaining about the provision that God has provided, and we find that their sin

248
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,479
of complaining would be judged.

249
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:54,999
Notice in verse number six, the Bible says, "...and the Lord sent fiery serpents among

250
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,519
the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died."

251
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,119
Isn't that a sad verse of Scripture?

252
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,599
The Bible tells us in verse number six that it was God who sent the fiery serpents.

253
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:10,639
The Bible tells us in verse number six that these fiery serpents, they bit the people.

254
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,199
The Bible tells us that many people, much people of Israel died.

255
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,879
God is just in all of His doings.

256
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,799
We find that their sin is met with judgment.

257
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,159
The justice of God is on display, and we find that as we look at this problem, and we consider

258
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,039
the problem this morning, and we think about their heart, their soul being discouraged

259
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,719
because of the way, and see their response to complaining not only about the direction

260
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:45,659
that God has provided, but even for the provision of God, we find that they failed to recognize

261
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,219
God's good hand that had been upon them.

262
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:55,259
You know, God had been so good to them, and God's been so good to us.

263
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:56,619
Amen?

264
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:01,419
When we complain, someone said it this way, when we complain, we're questioning the goodness

265
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,499
of God.

266
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,539
God is good all of the time.

267
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,419
And we find that in the passage of Scripture that is before us that they had this victory.

268
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,379
They made a vow to God in verse number two, and God hearkened to them, and God gave them

269
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,379
the victory, and immediately after the victory, they begin to journey following the leadership

270
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,659
that God would provide, and they begin to complain about the way, and as they complain

271
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,579
about the way, they say, by the way, there's no bread.

272
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,819
No, there is bread.

273
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:31,819
You had it this morning.

274
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,259
Yeah, but I don't like that bread.

275
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,699
I'm tired of that bread.

276
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:38,719
My soul loatheth this light bread.

277
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,899
There's no water.

278
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,379
Did you forget what God did?

279
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,899
Did you forget how God worked?

280
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,819
Did you forget the mighty hand of God?

281
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:54,939
Every step of the way, God had provided for His people, and yet they complain.

282
00:13:54,939 --> 00:14:01,099
We see the problem with the fiery serpents, and we find that they're in great distress

283
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,899
because of these fiery serpents.

284
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,939
All of a sudden, their mind is no more upon the direction, or the bread, or the water,

285
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,779
because they have fiery serpents that have entered into the camp that God has sent, and

286
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,419
people are being bitten, and people are dying from these serpents.

287
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:23,259
I want you to consider not only the problem, but consider God's provision.

288
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,339
We'll come back to verse number 7 in just a little while, but we find that the people

289
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:33,339
come, and they speak to Moses, and Moses prays, and verse number 8, notice the provision.

290
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,259
As we consider God's provision, God said unto Moses, and the Lord said unto Moses,

291
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:45,059
Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass that everyone

292
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:50,259
that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

293
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:55,099
We sing the song, Look and Live, and it's from this particular passage of Scripture

294
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:59,500
that the songwriter wrote those words to that familiar hymn.

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,940
We find that as we consider the provision of God, and we find here this morning that

296
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,859
God says to Moses to make a fiery serpent, to set it upon a pole.

297
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:14,659
He tells him that anyone, that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall

298
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,659
live.

299
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:16,659
Isn't that good news?

300
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,859
Isn't that miraculous to see how God is providing?

301
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:25,379
We find that here, just as we mentioned in verse number 6, that it was the judgment of

302
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,779
God, but now we see the grace and mercy of our God.

303
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm so thankful this morning that our God is gracious, and He's merciful.

304
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,259
His compassions, they fail not.

305
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,459
They're new every morning.

306
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,139
I'm thankful that He loves us.

307
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,099
As we begin to understand the provision of God as it's laid out in verse number 8, and

308
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:50,179
we find that Moses then responds in obedience, and we'll look at verse 7 and 9 here in just

309
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:55,019
a moment, but I want you to not only note the problem in the provision, but I want you

310
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,779
to consider the picture.

311
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,899
As we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that Jesus would make reference to this

312
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,159
Old Testament account when speaking to Nicodemus in John chapter number 3.

313
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,059
In John chapter number 3 and verse number 14, we find that Jesus would say this to Nicodemus.

314
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,419
With regard to this very account that we're looking at here in Numbers chapter 21, we

315
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:22,500
find that God, the Lord Jesus Christ, says to Nicodemus in verse number 14 of John 3,

316
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:29,279
and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be

317
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,539
lifted up.

318
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:35,019
We find that as we would consider the picture here of Numbers chapter 21, we find that it's

319
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,539
a picture of the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

320
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:45,139
We sang this morning the last song that we sang at the cross, and I'm so thankful for

321
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,419
the cross of Calvary.

322
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:52,379
I'm thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary in taking my place

323
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:58,739
and your place, and we think about this picture from Numbers chapter 21, and we see how Jesus

324
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:04,059
references this in John chapter number 3, and Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about being

325
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,579
born again.

326
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,220
And how is it that Nicodemus, how is it that any person can be born again?

327
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,459
It's through receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, and Jesus would have

328
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,979
to go to that cruel cross in order to pay for the sin of mankind.

329
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:25,139
He'd be buried in that borrowed tomb, and He would rise, conquering sin, death, and

330
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,139
the grave.

331
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:30,139
And we find that as we look at Numbers 21, and we understand there was a condition that

332
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:36,099
was affecting the people, there were fiery serpents and people were dying.

333
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:41,059
This morning we'd understand, as we use the parallel and consider the picture this morning,

334
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:47,579
that there's a universal condition of sin amongst people, human beings, and people that

335
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,379
die without Christ spend eternity in the lake of fire.

336
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:53,940
That's a biblical truth.

337
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,859
And I'm so thankful that even as the Lord provided for the children of Israel there

338
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:04,819
in Numbers 21, and He gave instruction there to Moses with regard to the brazen serpent,

339
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,859
I'm so thankful that God provided a way.

340
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,399
Aren't you thankful?

341
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:16,899
Remember the words of Jesus, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

342
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,859
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

343
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,139
I'm so thankful for His provision.

344
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,879
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves.

345
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:28,179
He did for us what no other person could do for us.

346
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:35,179
Only the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, could die in our place to provide us with

347
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,219
that gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

348
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,940
And so we're familiar with the passage of Scripture, we see the problem, the provision,

349
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
the picture.

350
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:49,559
But I want to spend the remainder of our time this morning focusing on Moses and looking

351
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,059
at his behavior in this particular situation.

352
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,219
And as we begin to look at Moses in this particular situation, I hope this morning that we could

353
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:04,679
relate to Moses and perhaps that as we look at his behavior and look at his testimony

354
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,380
here in these verses of Scripture, in this situation, that God would help us.

355
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,179
That we'd be encouraged, that we'd be challenged by the way in which Moses responded.

356
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,859
I want to remind you that in Numbers 21 and verse number 5, the Bible says, and the people

357
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:28,799
speak against God, and then notice what it says, and against Moses.

358
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,019
They spoke against Moses.

359
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,979
Not only against God, but against Moses.

360
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:40,320
Now we understand that the greater offense is speaking against God.

361
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,279
But Moses is the one that God had placed in that position of leadership, correct?

362
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:52,039
Moses is the one that really, he is there and he's seeking to obey the Lord, he's seeking

363
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,000
to be a faithful minister.

364
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
And we find that the people are speaking against Moses.

365
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,359
We find often throughout the Scriptures and the book of Numbers that there are many, many

366
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:00,359


367
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,139
many references in which the people

368
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,699
speak against God and against Moses.

369
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,279
They say, of Moses, you've led us here.

370
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,199
And I've often thought about Moses

371
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,919
and how he could say, did you not see?

372
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,819
I was just leading you in the direction

373
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,339
that God was leading us.

374
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:20,339
Surely, you saw the pillar of cloud.

375
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,359
The pillar of fire.

376
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,319
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

377
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,679
and we consider Moses

378
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,259
and we look at His behavior,

379
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:31,299
and we find that the people had spoken against Him,

380
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,979
but then notice in verse number seven,

381
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:37,979
the Bible says, therefore, the people came to Moses.

382
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:44,759
How do we respond when someone speaks against us

383
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,339
and then they come to us?

384
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,519
They come to Him and say, Moses,

385
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,879
they say this, we have sinned,

386
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,499
for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee.

387
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,979
Pray unto the Lord.

388
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:03,459
They recognize their sin.

389
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,219
They recognize their failure.

390
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:08,539
They recognize that they've sinned not only against Moses,

391
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,779
but they recognize that they've sinned against God.

392
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,179
We have sinned for we have spoken

393
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:16,039
against the Lord and against thee.

394
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,499
Forgiveness.

395
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,899
Oh, it's so important in the life of a believer.

396
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,019
Isn't it?

397
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,199
Forgiveness.

398
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,299
Moses in this situation,

399
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,559
we find that evidently through his behaviors,

400
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,639
we'll look at just a few things here in just a moment,

401
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,259
we find that he evidently forgave

402
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,479
these that had spoken against him.

403
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:43,019
But certainly, if we're not careful

404
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,699
and if we're operating in the flesh

405
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,099
more than we're operating in the spirit,

406
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,859
when someone speaks against us,

407
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,059
how ready are we to respond to their

408
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,259
seeking to make it right with forgiveness

409
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,039
and then with intercession?

410
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,019
See, why is it that we forgive?

411
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,979
Well, we forgive because we've been commanded to do so.

412
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:05,859
We forgive because we've been forgiven.

413
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,159
I won't go to the passage of Scripture,

414
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,859
but you look at Luke 17.

415
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,539
You look at the example of Jesus.

416
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,339
Remember when he says to the disciples,

417
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:16,079
Peter asked that question until seven times?

418
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,619
And Jesus says, I say not unto thee until seven times,

419
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,659
but until 70 times seven.

420
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:25,419
You read Luke 17 and you find there

421
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:26,499
in the passage of Scripture,

422
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,579
he speaks about somebody that comes multiple times

423
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,819
in the same day and offends you

424
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,539
and how you respond in forgiveness.

425
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,259
Someone said this about bitterness.

426
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,619
Bitterness destroys the vessel in which it's stored

427
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,159
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

428
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,019
And we fail to forgive that root of bitterness

429
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,739
that is spoken of in the book of Hebrews

430
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:54,059
begins to spring up in us.

431
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,979
And we find this morning that these people

432
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:01,979
that had spoken against God and they spoke against Moses,

433
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,399
they then come to Moses.

434
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,339
They confess, they acknowledge their sin,

435
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,179
and they say, Moses, would you pray for us?

436
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,379
Notice with me, as we note his behavior,

437
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,259
I note, first of all, his intercession.

438
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,819
His intercession, the Bible says that they say to Moses

439
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,619
after they had confessed and recognized their sin,

440
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,979
they said, pray unto the Lord

441
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:31,779
that he take away the serpents from us.

442
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,899
I want you to notice specifically

443
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:36,979
that they have a specific request.

444
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,179
What is their request?

445
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,879
That the serpents be taken away.

446
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,019
By the way, I don't fault them for that request.

447
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,299
Amen?

448
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,019
Praise God, take them away.

449
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,059
That'd be my request as well.

450
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:49,659
I don't like serpents,

451
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,659
I don't like the ones that they say are good, amen?

452
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,939
And so if they are fiery serpents

453
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:57,659
and people are being bitten and they are dying,

454
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,819
I want them taken away as well.

455
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,139
I get it, I understand why they make the request.

456
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:04,819
But we'll notice in just a few moments

457
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,859
that God doesn't answer specifically

458
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,699
the way that they request.

459
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,339
You know, sometimes God's not gonna take away

460
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,499
your problem or mine.

461
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,099
You say, but can't he?

462
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,259
Sure he can.

463
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,739
He has the ability to,

464
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:21,500
but sometimes he chooses not to.

465
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,739
Listen, just as God sent those fiery serpents,

466
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:28,099
certainly he could have removed those fiery serpents.

467
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,019
We see it in the plagues, right?

468
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:32,699
In Egypt, we read about the plagues

469
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,539
and God sent those particular things,

470
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,739
the frogs and the lice and so on and so forth,

471
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,679
the flies and all of those things,

472
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,459
and then God miraculously removed.

473
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:47,619
And we find here their request.

474
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,639
Their request is to pray.

475
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,179
The specific nature of their request

476
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,299
is that God would take away the serpents.

477
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,459
And I want you to notice,

478
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,419
and I've used it for the title this morning,

479
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,359
and Moses prayed for the people.

480
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,699
He prayed for the people.

481
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,379
I note his intercession.

482
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,299
You know, it's a great privilege to pray.

483
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,259
Prayer.

484
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:17,659
The time that we can commune with our God.

485
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:22,899
That we enter into that prayer closet

486
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,659
to get alone with God.

487
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,659
When we think about prayer,

488
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,019
there's many aspects of prayer

489
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,779
and we cannot deal with all of them

490
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,939
in just a few minutes that we have this morning.

491
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,139
But I want you to specifically note

492
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:35,979
where the Bible says,

493
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,579
and Moses prayed for the people.

494
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,679
This is intercessory prayer.

495
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,639
What a blessing to be able to take

496
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,459
before the throne of God the needs of others.

497
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:50,759
To pray for others.

498
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,559
We think about the ministry of intercessory prayer.

499
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,679
We think about the importance,

500
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,919
as we find in the New Testament,

501
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,659
that we're to pray one for another,

502
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,399
that we're to bear one another's burdens.

503
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,639
And we think about this interceding,

504
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,359
this intercessory prayer,

505
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,119
and that we have the privilege

506
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,479
of going to the throne room of heaven

507
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,379
and praying one for another.

508
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,919
That we can bring those requests.

509
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,219
Yes, we can pray for ourselves,

510
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:14,859
but what a blessing to be engaged

511
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,459
in that intercessory prayer.

512
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,479
And to know that others are praying for you.

513
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,859
It's a great encouragement

514
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:26,219
when someone sends a note or a card,

515
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,359
just says, I just want to let you know

516
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,459
that I'm praying for you.

517
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:30,459
I'm praying for you.

518
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,179
We find that he is going to pray.

519
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,659
We know his intercession.

520
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,779
We know that God answers prayer.

521
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:40,679
We've read it already,

522
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,139
but notice in verse number eight

523
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,859
that God answers the prayer,

524
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,159
and He answers it specifically.

525
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,099
By the way, I'm thankful that God hears

526
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,179
and answers prayer.

527
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,379
He hears and He answers.

528
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,659
He said, call unto Me and I will answer thee,

529
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,099
is what He said to Jeremiah

530
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,019
in chapter 33 and verse number three.

531
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,979
He says, and I will show thee great and mighty things

532
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:02,779
which thou knowest not.

533
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,339
And we find that as Moses is interceding,

534
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,379
as he's praying,

535
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,179
that the Lord then says unto Moses in verse number eight,

536
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,219
notice what he says,

537
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:14,019
make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole.

538
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,539
And it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten

539
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,500
when he looketh upon it shall live.

540
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,359
Now, is that what the people had requested?

541
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,579
No.

542
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,659
The people requested that the fiery serpents be removed.

543
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,739
He says this, this is what the people say,

544
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:34,619
that He, God, take away the serpents from us.

545
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,459
But when God answers, God says,

546
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,379
Moses, here's what I want you to do.

547
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,859
I want you to make a fiery serpent.

548
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,299
I want you to set it upon a pole

549
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,219
and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten

550
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:46,739
when he looketh upon it shall live.

551
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,139
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

552
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:51,579
They'd be bitten before they looked.

553
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,019
Think about that.

554
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:58,859
We find God's answer and God answered specifically.

555
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,419
And God gave specific direction to the request of Moses.

556
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,859
The prayer of Moses is not detailed for us.

557
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,259
It does not provide us here in the passage of Scripture

558
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,379
what specifically Moses prayed for.

559
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,619
The content of his prayer is not listed.

560
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,179
It just simply says that Moses prayed for the people

561
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:17,739
and God answered.

562
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:21,459
And God gave that specific instruction.

563
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:24,199
I know as we look at Moses and his behavior

564
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,500
in this situation, we find that we note first

565
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,379
his intercession, note now with me,

566
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:32,219
number two, his obedience.

567
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,039
His obedience.

568
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:38,880
The reality this morning is that it makes little sense

569
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,719
to ask God for direction and then to refuse to obey it.

570
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,559
It really makes little sense.

571
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,399
Correct?

572
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,479
We ask God, would you provide us with direction?

573
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,320
Would you give us an answer?

574
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,159
Would you do this?

575
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,880
And God answers because God is faithful and God provides

576
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,919
and God's given us His Word and we search the Scriptures

577
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,599
and we study the Word of God and we hear preaching

578
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,320
and we have our own personal devotions

579
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,799
and we see what God says in answering our prayer

580
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,679
for direction, it does little good if we do not obey it.

581
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:15,679
And we note the obedience of Moses in verse number nine,

582
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,679
the Bible says, and Moses made a serpent of brass

583
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,799
and put it upon a pole.

584
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,919
We'll come back to the rest of the verse in just a moment,

585
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,500
but I want you to notice the beginning of verse number nine

586
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,619
as we note the obedience, I believe that his obedience

587
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:36,119
is both immediate and complete.

588
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,140
We do not read in the context of Numbers chapter 21,

589
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,779
we do not read where there's any dialogue between Moses

590
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,260
and God saying, why should I have to do that?

591
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Or how does that, no, no, no, there's just stated obedience.

592
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:52,700
Okay, God.

593
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,380
Immediate.

594
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Sometimes, as we look at the.

595
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,980
the importance of obedience throughout the Word of God.

596
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,220
We could say of some that the record is given in the Word of God.

597
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,260
We could even say of our own lives that at times our obedience is not characterized by

598
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:21,940
being immediate and complete, but at times our obedience is delayed, partial.

599
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Someone said this about partial obedience, that partial obedience is still disobedience.

600
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,900
Complete obedience.

601
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:36,220
And we understand this morning as we begin to look at this text of Scripture, you say,

602
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,600
yeah, pastor, I understand there's immediate and there's complete obedience, but it's because

603
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
of the circumstances.

604
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,580
I mean, they were severe, they were dire.

605
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,620
People were being bitten and people were dying.

606
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
True.

607
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:54,220
But you know, obedience in your life and in my life is important to be immediate and complete

608
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,900
without delay.

609
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,420
For we know not what God has in store for us and what opportunities lie ahead as we

610
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,140
obey Him.

611
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,860
With that immediate and complete obedience, as we begin to evaluate our lives, we begin

612
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,020
to look at the example of Moses and say, man, I'm thankful for Moses.

613
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm thankful for his intercession.

614
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,560
I'm thankful that he forgave the people, the people that spoke against him.

615
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,760
He forgave them and he's interceding on their behalf.

616
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
He's praying and God answers prayer.

617
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,040
And as God gives direction, He obeys immediately and completely.

618
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
There's no discussion.

619
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,520
There's no, let's try to explain this some other way.

620
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,160
Let's try to see, does it have to be that way?

621
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,360
I mean, surely there could be a different way.

622
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,280
There ought to be something else we could do.

623
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,040
Could you imagine if they had a conference here amongst the children of Israel to determine

624
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
what they should do?

625
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,680
Can you imagine all of the different ideas they would come up with?

626
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,820
I'm pretty sure the one that God gave would probably not even have been thought of.

627
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:07,140
We find that it was not for Moses or for some other group of people to come up with a solution.

628
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,400
It was God who provided the solution and now it must simply be followed and obeyed.

629
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,480
And Moses immediately and completely obeyed what God had told him to do.

630
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,000
I find not only the intercession of Moses and the obedience of Moses, but I want you

631
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,919
to note and consider with me this morning, this third aspect as we think about Moses

632
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,000
and his behavior in this situation, I want you to note his faithfulness.

633
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,559
I want you to note the faithfulness of Moses.

634
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,980
I believe that Moses is a faithful minister, a faithful servant of the Lord, and evidently

635
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,520
as we look at this passage of Scripture, he communicated to the people of God the message

636
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,840
from God.

637
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,480
The Bible tells us just a few chapters back in Numbers chapter 12 and verse number 7,

638
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,120
God says this of Moses, He says,

639
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,480
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

640
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,800
Hebrews chapter 3 will repeat that same testimony of Moses of being faithful, and I'm thankful

641
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,919
for the faithfulness of Moses.

642
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,800
Listen, often we sing about God's faithfulness.

643
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

644
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Oh man, God is faithful.

645
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
He is trustworthy.

646
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,160
He is dependable.

647
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
He's never failed you.

648
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
He's never failed me.

649
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,440
He's never going to, and the reality is that as we sing of God's faithfulness, we understand

650
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,400
that we too as His people are to be faithful, and as we look at Moses in the passage of

651
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,160
Scripture, you will not see the word faithful.

652
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
You will not note it.

653
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,080
Here we see, as I referenced already in the 12th chapter, that God makes mention that

654
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,800
Moses is faithful, but we find that he was faithful to communicate this message that

655
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,440
God had given to Moses that needed to be given to the people.

656
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,120
Though the passage of Scripture does not record for us again the entirety of the prayer of

657
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,639
Moses, we do not find here either where Moses sits down and communicates with all the people,

658
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,480
but it's implied, it's evident that he communicated to the people.

659
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,040
For notice in verse number 9, and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole,

660
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,959
and notice what it says, and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, when

661
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:30,679
he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

662
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,119
Remember what God said in verse number 8?

663
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,920
He said, Moses, make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole, and it shall come

664
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,880
to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

665
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,800
Listen, it would not have been sufficient for Moses, say this is the congregation of

666
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,559
the nation of Israel, for him to make a brass, a brazen serpent, put it on a pole, and set

667
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,920
it there, and then go back to his tent.

668
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,000
What am I supposed to do with that?

669
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Isn't that what you'd ask?

670
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,279
That's great, Moses, but what does that mean?

671
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:13,839
Evidently, it seems implied in the text of Scripture when you read verse number 9, that

672
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,720
anyone that was bitten, when he looked, he lived.

673
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,559
How did he know to look?

674
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:32,239
Because Moses had communicated the message from God to the people.

675
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,040
Would you agree with that?

676
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,679
How else would they know?

677
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:43,040
And as we look at the text of Scripture, and that's where we see the faithfulness of Moses.

678
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,520
See, as Moses prays, and he prays for the people, and God gives him the answer, and

679
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,320
he provides him with the direction that he needs, we find that Moses was entrusted with

680
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,399
this responsibility of communicating this message to the masses.

681
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:08,720
To the people, the children of Israel, countless scores of people that he had been given the

682
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,800
responsibility from a human perspective of leadership, God was their leader, but God

683
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,640
had used Moses personally and humanly speaking, and now he has the responsibility of communicating

684
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,679
this message.

685
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,160
And the Bible tells us, listen, God could have removed the fiery serpents, but he chose

686
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,800
not to.

687
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,760
The remedy was in this brazen serpent.

688
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,559
And what the people needed to know as those serpents were still in the camp and they were

689
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:44,320
still biting people, that if you get bitten, you need to look.

690
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,239
And if you look, you'll live.

691
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:54,200
And it says that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass,

692
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,440
he lived.

693
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:06,559
This morning, as we think about the intercession, the obedience, and the faithfulness of Moses,

694
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,559
I hope that we would rejoice.

695
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,559
Amen?

696
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,760
Do you think that the congregation of the children of Israel were thankful that Moses

697
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,200
interceded?

698
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,920
Had he not interceded, they'd have no answer, right?

699
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,800
Had Moses not prayed, had he not forgiven the people, had he not sought the face of

700
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,279
God, had he not inquired of the Lord, God's not going to answer him.

701
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:35,119
God's not going to provide him with the direction, and the people are going to continue to deal

702
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,520
with these fiery serpents.

703
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,239
I believe this morning the people were thankful that Moses interceded.

704
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:51,839
Let me ask you this, do you think the people were thankful that Moses obeyed?

705
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,200
What happens if he doesn't obey?

706
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,200
What happens if Moses says, thanks for that information, God, I'll store that away somewhere

707
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,520
and maybe get to it at some point?

708
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm being a little fastidious this morning, but you understand.

709
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:19,279
I believe the people were very thankful that Moses responded in obedience and that it was

710
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:22,839
complete and immediate.

711
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,360
I mean, if Moses had just partially obeyed, if he had just made a brazen serpent but didn't

712
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:35,160
put it on a pole, if he had not communicated to the people, I mean, again, we see the seriousness

713
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,080
and the importance of the complete and the immediate obedience.

714
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,919
I believe that Moses was faithful.

715
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:50,479
I believe that the congregation of Israel were thankful for the faithfulness of Moses,

716
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:57,239
that Moses could be entrusted with the remedy, if we can call it that this morning, and that

717
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:05,559
Moses would be faithful to deliver the message to the people that they so desperately needed.

718
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,840
Now they were quite aware of their need.

719
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,400
We could argue today that many people are not aware of their needs, but we find these

720
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,160
people, they were quite aware of their need.

721
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
We think about the faithfulness.

722
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,599
I want you to consider this from the book of Proverbs, and there's some verses that

723
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,400
you know.

724
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,440
We think about the faithfulness of Moses and how thankful we are and how Solomon would

725
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,119
write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God this truth of faithfulness.

726
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,520
He said this in Proverbs 20 and verse number 6.

727
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,520
In Proverbs 20 and verse number 6, it says most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness.

728
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,119
But then notice this question, but a faithful man, who can find?

729
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,539
You know, it's not hard to find people that will proclaim their own goodness.

730
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:54,539
Is it?

731
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,659
I mean, just open your ears a little bit in our society today.

732
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:00,619
You can find all kinds of people proclaiming their own goodness.

733
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:08,179
But he says, but a faithful man, who can find?

734
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:18,219
Notice in chapter 25, in verse number 13, as the cold of snow in the time of harvest,

735
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:26,819
so is a faithful messenger to them that sent him, for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

736
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:34,359
The faithful messenger, that as he faithfully fulfills the task that had been given to him,

737
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:41,259
that he refresheth the soul of his masters or of those who had sent that message.

738
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:51,559
We find that in chapter 28, in verse number 20, notice the first statement here.

739
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:54,739
This is encouraging.

740
00:40:54,739 --> 00:41:03,019
In Proverbs 28, in verse number 20, a faithful man, notice what it says, shall abound with

741
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,759
blessings.

742
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,559
That's encouraging, isn't it?

743
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,139
The contrast there, but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

744
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:18,659
But I want you to focus on the faithful man, and I begin to think about this response of

745
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,179
Moses here in the passage of Scripture in Numbers 21, and I begin to see about this

746
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:27,899
man that he interceded for the people.

747
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:32,319
He obeyed God, and he was faithful.

748
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,599
A faithful man who can find, the book of Proverbs says, a faithful messenger refresheth the

749
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,219
soul of his masters.

750
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:44,419
And then the Bible says, a faithful man shall abound with blessings.

751
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:50,419
Man, I want to abound with blessings, faithfulness.

752
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:53,699
What did Paul say under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in 1 Corinthians chapter

753
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:54,699
number 4?

754
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:59,220
He's speaking of stewards, and he says, moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found

755
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,699
faithful.

756
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:06,679
God didn't call every one of us to do the same thing.

757
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:11,059
God didn't call everyone to be a Moses, amen?

758
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:20,159
And some people said, praise the Lord, because I couldn't have led those people, amen?

759
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:29,839
But God did call every one of us to be faithful, to be obedient, and to be intercessors.

760
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:33,259
And that's an example that we see in Numbers 21 of Moses.

761
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:38,519
See, each and every one of us can be an intercessor, amen?

762
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,860
We can pray one for another.

763
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,580
And by the way, we ought to be.

764
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:52,779
Every one of us can be obedient to the decision that we make.

765
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,099
We can obey or we disobey.

766
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,860
There's really no middle ground.

767
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:04,839
We find that this morning, just as Moses was obedient, every time God provides you or provides

768
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:09,159
me with direction, there's a choice to be made.

769
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:13,080
Will I obey or will I disobey?

770
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,479
You say, why do you boil it down so basic?

771
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:18,119
Because really that's just how basic it is.

772
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,080
It's really just what it boils down to.

773
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,559
And every single one of us can be faithful.

774
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:29,139
It's a choice that we make.

775
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,379
God requires faithfulness.

776
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:32,619
He blesses faithfulness.

777
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,459
He Himself is faithful.

778
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,360
It's amazing.

779
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,899
As we study the Word of God and we say, look, there's some things we can look at some people

780
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,619
and say, well, I can't do that, I can't do that.

781
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,619
God didn't call me to do that.

782
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:45,619
It's fine.

783
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,419
What did He call you to do?

784
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,220
Be obedient and be faithful.

785
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,959
And every single one of us, we can intercede, we can obey, and we can be faithful.

786
00:43:56,959 --> 00:44:00,759
It's just a matter of what we choose to do.

787
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:05,239
So this morning as we look at Numbers 21, again, a familiar portion of Scripture, but

788
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:12,199
as we focus in on the behavior of Moses, I hope this morning that we've been encouraged

789
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:17,799
by Moses' behavior, that we would be thankful and rejoice just as the nation of Israel would

790
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:18,799
have.

791
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,479
Oh, Moses, we're thankful that you prayed because you got an answer.

792
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:26,139
Oh, Moses, we're thankful that you obeyed because we have a solution, we have a remedy.

793
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:32,000
We're thankful that you're faithful, Moses, because how would we have known otherwise?

794
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,179
And we're encouraged by it.

795
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:39,399
But I hope this morning we'd be challenged by it in our own lives, and we'd examine ourselves.

796
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:43,880
Lord, how am I doing with the ministry of intercessory prayer?

797
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,799
Am I really going to God on the behalf of others?

798
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:50,160
What does my prayer life look like?

799
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,440
God, how's my obedience?

800
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
Is it immediate?

801
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,040
Is it complete?

802
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,760
God, how's my faithfulness?

803
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,320
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I hope that we could identify with Moses more

804
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,639
than with the people, because the people, their soul was much discouraged because of

805
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,359
the way they began to complain.

806
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,479
We have no bread, we have no water, and this light bread, our soul loatheth this light

807
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:23,479
bread.

808
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:28,880
Oh, I hope that we could identify more with Moses than with the children of Israel, the

809
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
people.

810
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,679
Listen, it's easy to complain, it really is, but God says that we're to be thankful, we're

811
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,040
to give thanks in everything, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning

812
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
you.

813
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,919
So, this morning, Moses prayed for the people, and I hope that as we examine these three

814
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:54,399
aspects of the behavior of Moses, that we just evaluate our own lives, say, God, would

815
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:56,239
You use us?

816
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,600
Would You use us in our little place, in our little opportunity of influence?

817
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,199
Use us, God, for Your glory.

818
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:11,720
Listen, we've been given, we've been entrusted with truth.

819
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,040
When Brother Michael shared from that prayer letter, and I'm thankful that he gave the

820
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:28,679
numbers, 30 people that are out weekly sharing the gospel, that's encouraging, that's exciting,

821
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:36,399
that's convicting, and what a joy to know that we can be faithful in our little place

822
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:40,760
where God has put us to do what God's called us to do.

823
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Let's pray together.

824
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
Father, we love You.

825
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,959
How we thank You for loving us.

826
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:47,919
We thank You for the Word of God.

827
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:53,579
We thank You for this great account of Your provision for Your people, and Lord, how they

828
00:46:53,579 --> 00:47:02,739
confessed their sin and they received an answer as Moses prayed, and God, You provided

829
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,699
them with deliverance.

830
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,820
We thank You for Your grace and for Your mercy.

831
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:14,019
We thank You for the picture of Calvary, and how Jesus referred to this passage of Scripture

832
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:19,859
speaking about the substitutionary atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary,

833
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:22,979
and how thankful we are that Jesus went to that cruel cross.

834
00:47:22,979 --> 00:47:27,699
He suffered, He bled and died, He was buried in a borrowed tomb, and He rose conquering

835
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,619
sin, death, and the grave.

836
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:31,359
We thank You that He lives forevermore.

837
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,779
We thank You that You have called us to be Your servants and Your ministers, and I pray

838
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:39,619
that as we examine this passage this morning that You'd help us, Lord, to be encouraged

839
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,779
by the behavior of Moses more than being encouraged by his behavior.

840
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:47,619
I pray, God, that You'd use Your Word to challenge us.

841
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:57,540
Lord, that we would evaluate our intercession, our obedience, and our faithfulness.

842
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,899
Lord, use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

843
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:08,139
I pray that in these moments that decisions would be made that would please Thee, that

844
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:12,380
decisions would be sealed, that, God, You'd be glorified.

845
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,940
We'll thank You for it, in Christ's name we pray.

846
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,940
Would You stand with me?

847
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,380
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

848
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,380
No one's looking around.

849
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,739
We have an opportunity to have a time of invitation, give you an opportunity to respond to the

850
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,419
Lord.
