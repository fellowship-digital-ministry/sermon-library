WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
First chapter number 21, and we'll be looking specifically

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.679
at verses four through nine.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.760
It'll be a familiar passage of scripture for you

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.880
in those verses, but I trust that as we go to the word

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.460
of God this morning, and though the passage is familiar,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.159
we understand that the lessons are valuable,

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.579
and I trust that that would be the case this morning.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.219
As you read through the book of Numbers,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.440
you will learn of the wilderness wanderings,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.680
and you'll read about the children of Israel

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.079
as they're led by the Lord through the wilderness,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.979
and of course, we understand that it was God's plan

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.459
to deliver them from Egypt and to take them

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.060
to the land of promise, but because of their unbelief

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.659
and their unwillingness to obey and to live by faith,

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.220
we find that they wandered there in the wilderness,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.240
and we find that as we study through the book of Numbers,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.299
there are several specific accounts

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.740
that God provides us with that help us understand

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.299
the importance of faith and obedience,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.500
and we find that as we look at this particular book

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.900
and think about the content of the book of Numbers,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.259
we are mindful of the fact that God

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.860
is leading the children of Israel.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.580
We understand that Moses is the human leader,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.139
but we are aware of the fact that God,

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.059
after the Passover, that he led his people

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:19.500
with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.800
and we understand the leadership that God provided.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500
By the way, aren't you thankful for God's leadership?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
I'm thankful that today, though we do not have

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.760
a pillar of cloud by day or a pillar of fire by night,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.199
we have the complete canon of scripture.

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:35.559
We have the word of God.

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:38.440
As New Testament believers, we have the Holy Spirit of God

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.440
who indwells us, and the scriptures tell us

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.800
that he will guide us into all truth,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.779
and I am so thankful for God's leadership

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.959
and his direction in our lives.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.000
We find that as we come to Numbers 21,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
the beginning of the chapter opens up

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.239
with providing us with a record of Israel's victory

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.400
over King Arad and the Canaanites.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.879
The Bible tells us, and when King Arad, the Canaanite,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.480
which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.419
came by the way of the spies, then he fought against Israel

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.059
and took some of them prisoners.

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.479
We find that it's a very quick record that is provided,

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.000
but the children of Israel have victory,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.479
for it tells us in verse number three

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.240
that the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.399
You can read their vow in verse number two,

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.320
and delivered up the Canaanites,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.899
and so we find that Numbers 21 begins

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.059
with a record of victory.

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.179
We end the 21st chapter of the book of Numbers

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.779
in verse 10 all the way down through the end of the chapter

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.460
in verse number 35, and you'll read there

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.220
that God provides us with the record

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.179
of Israel's victory over Sihon and Og.

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:46.059
And so as we look at Numbers chapter 21,

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.259
it's a very interesting chapter in the word of God,

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.460
for you find that it begins with victory

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.600
and it ends with victory, but in these few verses,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.580
these handful of verses that I wanna focus

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.259
our attention on this morning,

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.660
we find that God provides us in between

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.179
these great victories, really the failure of his people

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.179
and the judgment, and we look and we see

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.460
the record of those fiery serpents.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.160
And it's very interesting to me how that you would read

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.479
in verses four through nine of these fiery serpents,

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.820
and you would read of the sin of the people,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.740
the complaining of the people, and all that takes place,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.320
and you would be mindful of the fact of the victory

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.559
that had just taken place at the beginning of the chapter.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.440
We find that as you would study through the word of God,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.639
that oftentimes you will find that God's people

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.559
become greatly vulnerable to the attack of the enemy

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.399
in times of victory, in times of victory.

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.919
It's in those times of victory that we can become

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.820
self-sufficient, self-dependent, we can come to the place

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.119
where we feel like we can handle this,

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.520
and we come to a place where we begin to think

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.960
that we may know more, that we may have a better plan,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.279
and we find that in this particular chapter

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.559
that it was the plan that God had for the children of Israel

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:07.020
that they complained about the direction and the provision

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.080
that he had provided them with,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.000
and we find that they complained about that.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.440
I'll take some time this morning to go through the nine,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.000
these verses, verses four through nine,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.279
provide you with some, an outline if you will,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.160
but at the end of the message, and really the bulk

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.480
of the message this morning, I wanna focus upon Moses.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.480
And I wanna look at the behavior of Moses

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.959
as it's provided to us here in this portion of scripture,

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.959
and trust that God would use his behavior and his example

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.760
to encourage us and to challenge us

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760
in our own walk with God.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.959
We find that in verse number seven, excuse me,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.440
in verse number, let's see, verse number seven,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.559
it says at the end of the verse,

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.000
and Moses prayed for the people,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.160
and you see that we've used that title this morning,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.279
Moses prayed for the people.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.119
I want you to just take a quick outline

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:59.679
of the passage of scripture.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.660
Notice with me number one, if you would,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.480
consider the problem.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.679
In verses four through six, God reveals to us

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:08.000
the problem that they encounter here.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.359
The Bible says in verse number four,

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.160
and they, the children of Israel,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.600
they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.959
to compass the land of Edom,

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.980
and the soul of the people was much discouraged

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.100
because of the way.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.619
I want you to think about verse number four here

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.820
and understand as we begin to dig into the problem

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.660
and we wanna be able to identify the cause of the problem,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.059
if we were to say in this passage of scripture

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.359
that the problem is the fiery serpents,

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:38.299
then how did that come about?

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:40.059
Why did these fiery serpents come?

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.019
We find that the Bible begins to reveal to us

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.940
in verse number four about their journey,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.660
the details concerning the path

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.700
that God would lead them on.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.420
The Bible tells us that they journeyed from Mount Hor

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.420
by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.559
and we find that God reveals to us here

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.600
the direction that He's providing them with.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.059
Again, by way of introduction, I made note

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.140
that the fact that God is the one

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.000
providing them with leadership.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.619
It is God that is leading them and directing them.

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.220
Yes, Moses is the human leader of the children of Israel,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.820
but God is providing that direction.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.940
The Bible ends in verse number four with this note,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.820
the soul of the people was much discouraged

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.820
because of the way.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.459
You know, if we're not careful in our lives,

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.859
we can get discouraged because of the way, the journey.

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:39.540
It may not be the exact path

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.760
that we had laid out for ourselves.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.899
It might not be the plan that we develop,

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:46.040
the plan that we think,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.380
but we understand that God is sovereign

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.739
and God has a plan and God is the one

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:52.260
providing the leadership,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.519
and if we're not careful this morning,

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:57.619
we can become discouraged just like the people.

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:02.859
Notice what happens after their heart is discouraged,

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:05.619
after the soul of the people was much discouraged

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:06.540
because of the way.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.619
Notice how that they responded

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.220
to that measure of discouragement,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.299
and by the way, understand this morning

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.700
that discouragement is unfortunate

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.739
and we find that many people in our society today

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:22.220
deal with disappointment and discouragement,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.100
but how we respond in times of discouragement.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.779
Notice, this is a poor example

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.980
of responding in time of discouragement.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.500
The people, they spake against God.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.959
Wow.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.459
You say, I'd never do that.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:41.779
Maybe not out loud.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.619
Right?

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:47.339
They spake against God.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.059
And the Bible says against Moses.

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:56.480
Their response was to speak against the Lord,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.260
to question perhaps His goodness,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.940
to question His understanding,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.619
to question the direction in which they led them.

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.859
As they would be here in this desert place,

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:09.440
as they would be here in this difficult place,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.179
we find that they respond to that way

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.980
that they were led by speaking against God

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.579
and against Moses, and notice what they say.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:19.420
Notice their complaint.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.859
It says, wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:25.220
to die in the wilderness?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.260
By the way, is not this a recurring theme

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.700
for the children of Israel?

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.579
They often would say, in fact,

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:35.280
immediately before they ever crossed the Red Sea,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.179
when they're facing the Red Sea

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.320
and the Egyptians are in hot pursuit behind them,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.700
they say that God led us here to die

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.020
because there weren't enough graves over in Egypt.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.380
We find that they continue with this thought, this theme,

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.539
and they not only say that,

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:54.320
but I want you to notice how that their complaint,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.419
what are they complaining about?

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:57.780
Number one, the direction that God provided,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.460
but also they're complaining about God's provision.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.219
Notice what they say.

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:07.859
And they say this, for there is no bread.

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:11.340
Now, is that true or false?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.059
It's false.

00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:17.479
They even say at the end of their statement,

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:18.780
after they say there is no bread,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.539
they say, and our soul loatheth this light bread.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.580
They've been deceived.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.099
Their complaint about the provision.

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:33.500
I want you to think about this bread

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.780
that they refer to as light bread.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.020
I want you to think about the provision of God,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.260
the miraculous provision of God.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.340
This is manna.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.979
And God would rain down manna for them.

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:48.580
And it was so interesting.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.840
They would go out and they would gather the manna

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.419
and they would have sufficient.

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:54.059
And of course, if they gathered more

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:54.940
than they were supposed to

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.299
and they tried to store it overnight,

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:58.340
those first days, what would happen?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.299
Man, it would rot, it would grow worms.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.019
stink, but we find that on day number six, they're to go out and they're to gather twice

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:06.499
as much.

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:07.859
Why?

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:14.859
For God was not going to send the manna on the Sabbath, and we find that there were some

00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:17.659
that they did not gather twice as much.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.139
They went out and they tried to find it and there was none.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:21.139
Why?

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:27.639
They didn't follow the direction, but God miraculously had provided this manna.

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.839
It's His sustenance for His people.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:35.079
It's His provision, and they're complaining about God's provision.

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:43.519
And then they say this, neither is there any water.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:53.119
Now when they first leave Egypt, they come to a place of bitter water.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:58.759
God miraculously heals those waters so that they could drink.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:06.639
We find that they then would come to a place where there's no water, and what did God do?

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:11.519
He told Moses where to go and told him about a rock and told him to smite the rock and

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.399
waters would gush out, and what happened?

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.399
God provided water.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:19.359
I mean, the miraculous provision of God.

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:24.359
Listen, the truth of the matter, Matthew tells us in the sixth chapter that God knows what

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:26.039
we have need of.

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:27.119
God knows our needs.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:32.359
He's formed us, He's made us, and He knows what we need, and He graciously provides for

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.359
us.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:39.079
And we find here that the children of Israel, the problem that is here, that they are complaining

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:41.239
about the direction that God has provided.

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:47.799
They're complaining about the provision that God has provided, and we find that their sin

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:50.479
of complaining would be judged.

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:54.999
Notice in verse number six, the Bible says, "...and the Lord sent fiery serpents among

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.519
the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died."

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:01.119
Isn't that a sad verse of Scripture?

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:05.599
The Bible tells us in verse number six that it was God who sent the fiery serpents.

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:10.639
The Bible tells us in verse number six that these fiery serpents, they bit the people.

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:17.199
The Bible tells us that many people, much people of Israel died.

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:20.879
God is just in all of His doings.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:24.799
We find that their sin is met with judgment.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:30.159
The justice of God is on display, and we find that as we look at this problem, and we consider

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:35.039
the problem this morning, and we think about their heart, their soul being discouraged

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:39.719
because of the way, and see their response to complaining not only about the direction

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:45.659
that God has provided, but even for the provision of God, we find that they failed to recognize

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:49.219
God's good hand that had been upon them.

00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:55.259
You know, God had been so good to them, and God's been so good to us.

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:56.619
Amen?

00:12:56.619 --> 00:13:01.419
When we complain, someone said it this way, when we complain, we're questioning the goodness

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.499
of God.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:06.539
God is good all of the time.

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:12.419
And we find that in the passage of Scripture that is before us that they had this victory.

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:17.379
They made a vow to God in verse number two, and God hearkened to them, and God gave them

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:22.379
the victory, and immediately after the victory, they begin to journey following the leadership

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:26.659
that God would provide, and they begin to complain about the way, and as they complain

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:29.579
about the way, they say, by the way, there's no bread.

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:30.819
No, there is bread.

00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:31.819
You had it this morning.

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:33.259
Yeah, but I don't like that bread.

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.699
I'm tired of that bread.

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.719
My soul loatheth this light bread.

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:39.899
There's no water.

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:41.379
Did you forget what God did?

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:42.899
Did you forget how God worked?

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:47.819
Did you forget the mighty hand of God?

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:54.939
Every step of the way, God had provided for His people, and yet they complain.

00:13:54.939 --> 00:14:01.099
We see the problem with the fiery serpents, and we find that they're in great distress

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:02.899
because of these fiery serpents.

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:07.939
All of a sudden, their mind is no more upon the direction, or the bread, or the water,

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:12.779
because they have fiery serpents that have entered into the camp that God has sent, and

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:18.419
people are being bitten, and people are dying from these serpents.

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:23.259
I want you to consider not only the problem, but consider God's provision.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:28.339
We'll come back to verse number 7 in just a little while, but we find that the people

00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:33.339
come, and they speak to Moses, and Moses prays, and verse number 8, notice the provision.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:38.259
As we consider God's provision, God said unto Moses, and the Lord said unto Moses,

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:45.059
Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass that everyone

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:50.259
that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:55.099
We sing the song, Look and Live, and it's from this particular passage of Scripture

00:14:55.099 --> 00:14:59.500
that the songwriter wrote those words to that familiar hymn.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.940
We find that as we consider the provision of God, and we find here this morning that

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.859
God says to Moses to make a fiery serpent, to set it upon a pole.

00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:14.659
He tells him that anyone, that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall

00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:15.659
live.

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:16.659
Isn't that good news?

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:19.859
Isn't that miraculous to see how God is providing?

00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:25.379
We find that here, just as we mentioned in verse number 6, that it was the judgment of

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:28.779
God, but now we see the grace and mercy of our God.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:33.940
I'm so thankful this morning that our God is gracious, and He's merciful.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.259
His compassions, they fail not.

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:37.459
They're new every morning.

00:15:37.459 --> 00:15:40.139
I'm thankful that He loves us.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:45.099
As we begin to understand the provision of God as it's laid out in verse number 8, and

00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:50.179
we find that Moses then responds in obedience, and we'll look at verse 7 and 9 here in just

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:55.019
a moment, but I want you to not only note the problem in the provision, but I want you

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.779
to consider the picture.

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.899
As we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that Jesus would make reference to this

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:06.159
Old Testament account when speaking to Nicodemus in John chapter number 3.

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:12.059
In John chapter number 3 and verse number 14, we find that Jesus would say this to Nicodemus.

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:16.419
With regard to this very account that we're looking at here in Numbers chapter 21, we

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:22.500
find that God, the Lord Jesus Christ, says to Nicodemus in verse number 14 of John 3,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.279
and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.539
lifted up.

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:35.019
We find that as we would consider the picture here of Numbers chapter 21, we find that it's

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:40.539
a picture of the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:45.139
We sang this morning the last song that we sang at the cross, and I'm so thankful for

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.419
the cross of Calvary.

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:52.379
I'm thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary in taking my place

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:58.739
and your place, and we think about this picture from Numbers chapter 21, and we see how Jesus

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:04.059
references this in John chapter number 3, and Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about being

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:06.579
born again.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:11.220
And how is it that Nicodemus, how is it that any person can be born again?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.459
It's through receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, and Jesus would have

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:20.979
to go to that cruel cross in order to pay for the sin of mankind.

00:17:20.979 --> 00:17:25.139
He'd be buried in that borrowed tomb, and He would rise, conquering sin, death, and

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:26.139
the grave.

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:30.139
And we find that as we look at Numbers 21, and we understand there was a condition that

00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:36.099
was affecting the people, there were fiery serpents and people were dying.

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:41.059
This morning we'd understand, as we use the parallel and consider the picture this morning,

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:47.579
that there's a universal condition of sin amongst people, human beings, and people that

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:51.379
die without Christ spend eternity in the lake of fire.

00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:53.940
That's a biblical truth.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.859
And I'm so thankful that even as the Lord provided for the children of Israel there

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:04.819
in Numbers 21, and He gave instruction there to Moses with regard to the brazen serpent,

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:07.859
I'm so thankful that God provided a way.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:10.399
Aren't you thankful?

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:16.899
Remember the words of Jesus, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:18:16.899 --> 00:18:19.859
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:22.139
I'm so thankful for His provision.

00:18:22.139 --> 00:18:24.879
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves.

00:18:24.879 --> 00:18:28.179
He did for us what no other person could do for us.

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:35.179
Only the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, could die in our place to provide us with

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:40.219
that gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:43.940
And so we're familiar with the passage of Scripture, we see the problem, the provision,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940
the picture.

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:49.559
But I want to spend the remainder of our time this morning focusing on Moses and looking

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:54.059
at his behavior in this particular situation.

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:59.219
And as we begin to look at Moses in this particular situation, I hope this morning that we could

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:04.679
relate to Moses and perhaps that as we look at his behavior and look at his testimony

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:10.380
here in these verses of Scripture, in this situation, that God would help us.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.179
That we'd be encouraged, that we'd be challenged by the way in which Moses responded.

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:19.859
I want to remind you that in Numbers 21 and verse number 5, the Bible says, and the people

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:28.799
speak against God, and then notice what it says, and against Moses.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:33.019
They spoke against Moses.

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:34.979
Not only against God, but against Moses.

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:40.320
Now we understand that the greater offense is speaking against God.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.279
But Moses is the one that God had placed in that position of leadership, correct?

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:52.039
Moses is the one that really, he is there and he's seeking to obey the Lord, he's seeking

00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:54.000
to be a faithful minister.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.640
And we find that the people are speaking against Moses.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.359
We find often throughout the Scriptures and the book of Numbers that there are many, many

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:00.359


00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:02.139
many references in which the people

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:04.699
speak against God and against Moses.

00:20:04.699 --> 00:20:07.279
They say, of Moses, you've led us here.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:09.199
And I've often thought about Moses

00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:11.919
and how he could say, did you not see?

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.819
I was just leading you in the direction

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.339
that God was leading us.

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.339
Surely, you saw the pillar of cloud.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:22.359
The pillar of fire.

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:25.319
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:26.679
and we consider Moses

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:28.259
and we look at His behavior,

00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:31.299
and we find that the people had spoken against Him,

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:32.979
but then notice in verse number seven,

00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:37.979
the Bible says, therefore, the people came to Moses.

00:20:40.579 --> 00:20:44.759
How do we respond when someone speaks against us

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.339
and then they come to us?

00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:51.519
They come to Him and say, Moses,

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:53.879
they say this, we have sinned,

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:56.499
for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee.

00:20:56.499 --> 00:20:58.979
Pray unto the Lord.

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:03.459
They recognize their sin.

00:21:03.459 --> 00:21:05.219
They recognize their failure.

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:08.539
They recognize that they've sinned not only against Moses,

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.779
but they recognize that they've sinned against God.

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:13.179
We have sinned for we have spoken

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:16.039
against the Lord and against thee.

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:19.499
Forgiveness.

00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:21.899
Oh, it's so important in the life of a believer.

00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:25.019
Isn't it?

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.199
Forgiveness.

00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:29.299
Moses in this situation,

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:31.559
we find that evidently through his behaviors,

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:33.639
we'll look at just a few things here in just a moment,

00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:36.259
we find that he evidently forgave

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.479
these that had spoken against him.

00:21:40.219 --> 00:21:43.019
But certainly, if we're not careful

00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:44.699
and if we're operating in the flesh

00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:47.099
more than we're operating in the spirit,

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:49.859
when someone speaks against us,

00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:53.059
how ready are we to respond to their

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:55.259
seeking to make it right with forgiveness

00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:57.039
and then with intercession?

00:21:58.419 --> 00:22:00.019
See, why is it that we forgive?

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:02.979
Well, we forgive because we've been commanded to do so.

00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:05.859
We forgive because we've been forgiven.

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.159
I won't go to the passage of Scripture,

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.859
but you look at Luke 17.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:10.539
You look at the example of Jesus.

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:13.339
Remember when he says to the disciples,

00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:16.079
Peter asked that question until seven times?

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:19.619
And Jesus says, I say not unto thee until seven times,

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:21.659
but until 70 times seven.

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:25.419
You read Luke 17 and you find there

00:22:25.419 --> 00:22:26.499
in the passage of Scripture,

00:22:26.499 --> 00:22:28.579
he speaks about somebody that comes multiple times

00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:30.819
in the same day and offends you

00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:33.539
and how you respond in forgiveness.

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:37.259
Someone said this about bitterness.

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:41.619
Bitterness destroys the vessel in which it's stored

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:44.159
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:50.019
And we fail to forgive that root of bitterness

00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:51.739
that is spoken of in the book of Hebrews

00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:54.059
begins to spring up in us.

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:56.979
And we find this morning that these people

00:22:56.979 --> 00:23:01.979
that had spoken against God and they spoke against Moses,

00:23:02.739 --> 00:23:05.399
they then come to Moses.

00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:08.339
They confess, they acknowledge their sin,

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:11.179
and they say, Moses, would you pray for us?

00:23:12.339 --> 00:23:15.379
Notice with me, as we note his behavior,

00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:18.259
I note, first of all, his intercession.

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:21.819
His intercession, the Bible says that they say to Moses

00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:24.619
after they had confessed and recognized their sin,

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.979
they said, pray unto the Lord

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:31.779
that he take away the serpents from us.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:33.899
I want you to notice specifically

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:36.979
that they have a specific request.

00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:38.179
What is their request?

00:23:38.179 --> 00:23:39.879
That the serpents be taken away.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:43.019
By the way, I don't fault them for that request.

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:44.299
Amen?

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.019
Praise God, take them away.

00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:48.059
That'd be my request as well.

00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:49.659
I don't like serpents,

00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:52.659
I don't like the ones that they say are good, amen?

00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:54.939
And so if they are fiery serpents

00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:57.659
and people are being bitten and they are dying,

00:23:57.659 --> 00:23:59.819
I want them taken away as well.

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:03.139
I get it, I understand why they make the request.

00:24:03.139 --> 00:24:04.819
But we'll notice in just a few moments

00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.859
that God doesn't answer specifically

00:24:06.859 --> 00:24:08.699
the way that they request.

00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:10.339
You know, sometimes God's not gonna take away

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:11.499
your problem or mine.

00:24:13.239 --> 00:24:15.099
You say, but can't he?

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:16.259
Sure he can.

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:18.739
He has the ability to,

00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:21.500
but sometimes he chooses not to.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.739
Listen, just as God sent those fiery serpents,

00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:28.099
certainly he could have removed those fiery serpents.

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.019
We see it in the plagues, right?

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:32.699
In Egypt, we read about the plagues

00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:35.539
and God sent those particular things,

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:37.739
the frogs and the lice and so on and so forth,

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:39.679
the flies and all of those things,

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:43.459
and then God miraculously removed.

00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:47.619
And we find here their request.

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.639
Their request is to pray.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:53.179
The specific nature of their request

00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:55.299
is that God would take away the serpents.

00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:56.459
And I want you to notice,

00:24:56.459 --> 00:24:58.419
and I've used it for the title this morning,

00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:02.359
and Moses prayed for the people.

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:05.699
He prayed for the people.

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:08.379
I note his intercession.

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:11.299
You know, it's a great privilege to pray.

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:15.259
Prayer.

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:17.659
The time that we can commune with our God.

00:25:18.939 --> 00:25:22.899
That we enter into that prayer closet

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:26.659
to get alone with God.

00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:27.659
When we think about prayer,

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.019
there's many aspects of prayer

00:25:29.019 --> 00:25:30.779
and we cannot deal with all of them

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:32.939
in just a few minutes that we have this morning.

00:25:32.939 --> 00:25:35.139
But I want you to specifically note

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:35.979
where the Bible says,

00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:38.579
and Moses prayed for the people.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:40.679
This is intercessory prayer.

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:43.639
What a blessing to be able to take

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:48.459
before the throne of God the needs of others.

00:25:49.459 --> 00:25:50.759
To pray for others.

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:54.559
We think about the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.679
We think about the importance,

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.919
as we find in the New Testament,

00:25:56.919 --> 00:25:58.659
that we're to pray one for another,

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:00.399
that we're to bear one another's burdens.

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:02.639
And we think about this interceding,

00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:04.359
this intercessory prayer,

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:06.119
and that we have the privilege

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:08.479
of going to the throne room of heaven

00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:10.379
and praying one for another.

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:11.919
That we can bring those requests.

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:13.219
Yes, we can pray for ourselves,

00:26:13.219 --> 00:26:14.859
but what a blessing to be engaged

00:26:14.859 --> 00:26:17.459
in that intercessory prayer.

00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:20.479
And to know that others are praying for you.

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:22.859
It's a great encouragement

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:26.219
when someone sends a note or a card,

00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:27.359
just says, I just want to let you know

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:29.459
that I'm praying for you.

00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:30.459
I'm praying for you.

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:36.179
We find that he is going to pray.

00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.659
We know his intercession.

00:26:37.659 --> 00:26:39.779
We know that God answers prayer.

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:40.679
We've read it already,

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.139
but notice in verse number eight

00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:43.859
that God answers the prayer,

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:46.159
and He answers it specifically.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:48.099
By the way, I'm thankful that God hears

00:26:48.099 --> 00:26:49.179
and answers prayer.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:53.379
He hears and He answers.

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:55.659
He said, call unto Me and I will answer thee,

00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:57.099
is what He said to Jeremiah

00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:59.019
in chapter 33 and verse number three.

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:00.979
He says, and I will show thee great and mighty things

00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:02.779
which thou knowest not.

00:27:02.779 --> 00:27:05.339
And we find that as Moses is interceding,

00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:06.379
as he's praying,

00:27:06.379 --> 00:27:09.179
that the Lord then says unto Moses in verse number eight,

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:10.219
notice what he says,

00:27:10.219 --> 00:27:14.019
make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole.

00:27:14.019 --> 00:27:16.539
And it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:19.500
when he looketh upon it shall live.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.359
Now, is that what the people had requested?

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.579
No.

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:27.659
The people requested that the fiery serpents be removed.

00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:29.739
He says this, this is what the people say,

00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:34.619
that He, God, take away the serpents from us.

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.459
But when God answers, God says,

00:27:36.459 --> 00:27:38.379
Moses, here's what I want you to do.

00:27:38.379 --> 00:27:39.859
I want you to make a fiery serpent.

00:27:39.859 --> 00:27:41.299
I want you to set it upon a pole

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:43.219
and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten

00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:46.739
when he looketh upon it shall live.

00:27:46.739 --> 00:27:49.139
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:51.579
They'd be bitten before they looked.

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:54.019
Think about that.

00:27:55.219 --> 00:27:58.859
We find God's answer and God answered specifically.

00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:03.419
And God gave specific direction to the request of Moses.

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:05.859
The prayer of Moses is not detailed for us.

00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:09.259
It does not provide us here in the passage of Scripture

00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:11.379
what specifically Moses prayed for.

00:28:11.379 --> 00:28:13.619
The content of his prayer is not listed.

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:16.179
It just simply says that Moses prayed for the people

00:28:16.179 --> 00:28:17.739
and God answered.

00:28:19.139 --> 00:28:21.459
And God gave that specific instruction.

00:28:21.459 --> 00:28:24.199
I know as we look at Moses and his behavior

00:28:24.199 --> 00:28:27.500
in this situation, we find that we note first

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.379
his intercession, note now with me,

00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:32.219
number two, his obedience.

00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:34.039
His obedience.

00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:38.880
The reality this morning is that it makes little sense

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.719
to ask God for direction and then to refuse to obey it.

00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:44.559
It really makes little sense.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:45.399
Correct?

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:47.479
We ask God, would you provide us with direction?

00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:48.320
Would you give us an answer?

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.159
Would you do this?

00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:52.880
And God answers because God is faithful and God provides

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.919
and God's given us His Word and we search the Scriptures

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:58.599
and we study the Word of God and we hear preaching

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:01.320
and we have our own personal devotions

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.799
and we see what God says in answering our prayer

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:09.679
for direction, it does little good if we do not obey it.

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:15.679
And we note the obedience of Moses in verse number nine,

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:20.679
the Bible says, and Moses made a serpent of brass

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:24.799
and put it upon a pole.

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.919
We'll come back to the rest of the verse in just a moment,

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:29.500
but I want you to notice the beginning of verse number nine

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.619
as we note the obedience, I believe that his obedience

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:36.119
is both immediate and complete.

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:41.140
We do not read in the context of Numbers chapter 21,

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.779
we do not read where there's any dialogue between Moses

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:46.260
and God saying, why should I have to do that?

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.260
Or how does that, no, no, no, there's just stated obedience.

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:52.700
Okay, God.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:55.380
Immediate.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.380
Sometimes, as we look at the.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.980
the importance of obedience throughout the Word of God.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.220
We could say of some that the record is given in the Word of God.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.260
We could even say of our own lives that at times our obedience is not characterized by

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:21.940
being immediate and complete, but at times our obedience is delayed, partial.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:28.940
Someone said this about partial obedience, that partial obedience is still disobedience.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.900
Complete obedience.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.220
And we understand this morning as we begin to look at this text of Scripture, you say,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.600
yeah, pastor, I understand there's immediate and there's complete obedience, but it's because

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600
of the circumstances.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.580
I mean, they were severe, they were dire.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.620
People were being bitten and people were dying.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.620
True.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:54.220
But you know, obedience in your life and in my life is important to be immediate and complete

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.900
without delay.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.420
For we know not what God has in store for us and what opportunities lie ahead as we

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.140
obey Him.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.860
With that immediate and complete obedience, as we begin to evaluate our lives, we begin

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.020
to look at the example of Moses and say, man, I'm thankful for Moses.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.620
I'm thankful for his intercession.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:17.560
I'm thankful that he forgave the people, the people that spoke against him.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.760
He forgave them and he's interceding on their behalf.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.760
He's praying and God answers prayer.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:29.040
And as God gives direction, He obeys immediately and completely.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.040
There's no discussion.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.520
There's no, let's try to explain this some other way.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.160
Let's try to see, does it have to be that way?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.360
I mean, surely there could be a different way.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.280
There ought to be something else we could do.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.040
Could you imagine if they had a conference here amongst the children of Israel to determine

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.160
what they should do?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.680
Can you imagine all of the different ideas they would come up with?

00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:00.820
I'm pretty sure the one that God gave would probably not even have been thought of.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:07.140
We find that it was not for Moses or for some other group of people to come up with a solution.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.400
It was God who provided the solution and now it must simply be followed and obeyed.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:20.480
And Moses immediately and completely obeyed what God had told him to do.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.000
I find not only the intercession of Moses and the obedience of Moses, but I want you

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.919
to note and consider with me this morning, this third aspect as we think about Moses

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:35.000
and his behavior in this situation, I want you to note his faithfulness.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.559
I want you to note the faithfulness of Moses.

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:46.980
I believe that Moses is a faithful minister, a faithful servant of the Lord, and evidently

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:53.520
as we look at this passage of Scripture, he communicated to the people of God the message

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.840
from God.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.480
The Bible tells us just a few chapters back in Numbers chapter 12 and verse number 7,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.120
God says this of Moses, He says,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:10.480
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:17.800
Hebrews chapter 3 will repeat that same testimony of Moses of being faithful, and I'm thankful

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.919
for the faithfulness of Moses.

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:22.800
Listen, often we sing about God's faithfulness.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.800
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.400
Oh man, God is faithful.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.800
He is trustworthy.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.160
He is dependable.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160
He's never failed you.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200
He's never failed me.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.440
He's never going to, and the reality is that as we sing of God's faithfulness, we understand

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:44.400
that we too as His people are to be faithful, and as we look at Moses in the passage of

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.160
Scripture, you will not see the word faithful.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160
You will not note it.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.080
Here we see, as I referenced already in the 12th chapter, that God makes mention that

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.800
Moses is faithful, but we find that he was faithful to communicate this message that

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:03.440
God had given to Moses that needed to be given to the people.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.120
Though the passage of Scripture does not record for us again the entirety of the prayer of

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.639
Moses, we do not find here either where Moses sits down and communicates with all the people,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.480
but it's implied, it's evident that he communicated to the people.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.040
For notice in verse number 9, and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole,

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.959
and notice what it says, and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, when

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:30.679
he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.119
Remember what God said in verse number 8?

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:36.920
He said, Moses, make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole, and it shall come

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.880
to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.800
Listen, it would not have been sufficient for Moses, say this is the congregation of

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.559
the nation of Israel, for him to make a brass, a brazen serpent, put it on a pole, and set

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:54.920
it there, and then go back to his tent.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.000
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Isn't that what you'd ask?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.279
That's great, Moses, but what does that mean?

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:13.839
Evidently, it seems implied in the text of Scripture when you read verse number 9, that

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:19.720
anyone that was bitten, when he looked, he lived.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.559
How did he know to look?

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:32.239
Because Moses had communicated the message from God to the people.

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.040
Would you agree with that?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.679
How else would they know?

00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:43.040
And as we look at the text of Scripture, and that's where we see the faithfulness of Moses.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:50.520
See, as Moses prays, and he prays for the people, and God gives him the answer, and

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.320
he provides him with the direction that he needs, we find that Moses was entrusted with

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.399
this responsibility of communicating this message to the masses.

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:08.720
To the people, the children of Israel, countless scores of people that he had been given the

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.800
responsibility from a human perspective of leadership, God was their leader, but God

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.640
had used Moses personally and humanly speaking, and now he has the responsibility of communicating

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.679
this message.

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:26.160
And the Bible tells us, listen, God could have removed the fiery serpents, but he chose

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.800
not to.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.760
The remedy was in this brazen serpent.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.559
And what the people needed to know as those serpents were still in the camp and they were

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:44.320
still biting people, that if you get bitten, you need to look.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.239
And if you look, you'll live.

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:54.200
And it says that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass,

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.440
he lived.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:06.559
This morning, as we think about the intercession, the obedience, and the faithfulness of Moses,

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:08.559
I hope that we would rejoice.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.559
Amen?

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:14.760
Do you think that the congregation of the children of Israel were thankful that Moses

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.200
interceded?

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.920
Had he not interceded, they'd have no answer, right?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.800
Had Moses not prayed, had he not forgiven the people, had he not sought the face of

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.279
God, had he not inquired of the Lord, God's not going to answer him.

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:35.119
God's not going to provide him with the direction, and the people are going to continue to deal

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:38.520
with these fiery serpents.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.239
I believe this morning the people were thankful that Moses interceded.

00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:51.839
Let me ask you this, do you think the people were thankful that Moses obeyed?

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:55.200
What happens if he doesn't obey?

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.200
What happens if Moses says, thanks for that information, God, I'll store that away somewhere

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.520
and maybe get to it at some point?

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:11.640
I'm being a little fastidious this morning, but you understand.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:19.279
I believe the people were very thankful that Moses responded in obedience and that it was

00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:22.839
complete and immediate.

00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:28.360
I mean, if Moses had just partially obeyed, if he had just made a brazen serpent but didn't

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:35.160
put it on a pole, if he had not communicated to the people, I mean, again, we see the seriousness

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.080
and the importance of the complete and the immediate obedience.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.919
I believe that Moses was faithful.

00:38:42.919 --> 00:38:50.479
I believe that the congregation of Israel were thankful for the faithfulness of Moses,

00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:57.239
that Moses could be entrusted with the remedy, if we can call it that this morning, and that

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:05.559
Moses would be faithful to deliver the message to the people that they so desperately needed.

00:39:05.559 --> 00:39:10.840
Now they were quite aware of their need.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:15.400
We could argue today that many people are not aware of their needs, but we find these

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.160
people, they were quite aware of their need.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.160
We think about the faithfulness.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.599
I want you to consider this from the book of Proverbs, and there's some verses that

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:24.400
you know.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.440
We think about the faithfulness of Moses and how thankful we are and how Solomon would

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.119
write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God this truth of faithfulness.

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:37.520
He said this in Proverbs 20 and verse number 6.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.520
In Proverbs 20 and verse number 6, it says most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.119
But then notice this question, but a faithful man, who can find?

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:53.539
You know, it's not hard to find people that will proclaim their own goodness.

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:54.539
Is it?

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:57.659
I mean, just open your ears a little bit in our society today.

00:39:57.659 --> 00:40:00.619
You can find all kinds of people proclaiming their own goodness.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:08.179
But he says, but a faithful man, who can find?

00:40:08.179 --> 00:40:18.219
Notice in chapter 25, in verse number 13, as the cold of snow in the time of harvest,

00:40:18.219 --> 00:40:26.819
so is a faithful messenger to them that sent him, for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

00:40:26.819 --> 00:40:34.359
The faithful messenger, that as he faithfully fulfills the task that had been given to him,

00:40:34.359 --> 00:40:41.259
that he refresheth the soul of his masters or of those who had sent that message.

00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:51.559
We find that in chapter 28, in verse number 20, notice the first statement here.

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:54.739
This is encouraging.

00:40:54.739 --> 00:41:03.019
In Proverbs 28, in verse number 20, a faithful man, notice what it says, shall abound with

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:05.759
blessings.

00:41:05.759 --> 00:41:07.559
That's encouraging, isn't it?

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:11.139
The contrast there, but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

00:41:11.139 --> 00:41:18.659
But I want you to focus on the faithful man, and I begin to think about this response of

00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:23.179
Moses here in the passage of Scripture in Numbers 21, and I begin to see about this

00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:27.899
man that he interceded for the people.

00:41:27.899 --> 00:41:32.319
He obeyed God, and he was faithful.

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:36.599
A faithful man who can find, the book of Proverbs says, a faithful messenger refresheth the

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:38.219
soul of his masters.

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:44.419
And then the Bible says, a faithful man shall abound with blessings.

00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:50.419
Man, I want to abound with blessings, faithfulness.

00:41:50.419 --> 00:41:53.699
What did Paul say under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in 1 Corinthians chapter

00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:54.699
number 4?

00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:59.220
He's speaking of stewards, and he says, moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.699
faithful.

00:42:02.699 --> 00:42:06.679
God didn't call every one of us to do the same thing.

00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:11.059
God didn't call everyone to be a Moses, amen?

00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:20.159
And some people said, praise the Lord, because I couldn't have led those people, amen?

00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:29.839
But God did call every one of us to be faithful, to be obedient, and to be intercessors.

00:42:29.979 --> 00:42:33.259
And that's an example that we see in Numbers 21 of Moses.

00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:38.519
See, each and every one of us can be an intercessor, amen?

00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:41.860
We can pray one for another.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.580
And by the way, we ought to be.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:52.779
Every one of us can be obedient to the decision that we make.

00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:56.099
We can obey or we disobey.

00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:58.860
There's really no middle ground.

00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:04.839
We find that this morning, just as Moses was obedient, every time God provides you or provides

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:09.159
me with direction, there's a choice to be made.

00:43:09.159 --> 00:43:13.080
Will I obey or will I disobey?

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.479
You say, why do you boil it down so basic?

00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:18.119
Because really that's just how basic it is.

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:23.080
It's really just what it boils down to.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.559
And every single one of us can be faithful.

00:43:26.259 --> 00:43:29.139
It's a choice that we make.

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:30.379
God requires faithfulness.

00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:32.619
He blesses faithfulness.

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:35.459
He Himself is faithful.

00:43:35.459 --> 00:43:38.360
It's amazing.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.899
As we study the Word of God and we say, look, there's some things we can look at some people

00:43:41.899 --> 00:43:43.619
and say, well, I can't do that, I can't do that.

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:44.619
God didn't call me to do that.

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:45.619
It's fine.

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:47.419
What did He call you to do?

00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:50.220
Be obedient and be faithful.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:56.959
And every single one of us, we can intercede, we can obey, and we can be faithful.

00:43:56.959 --> 00:44:00.759
It's just a matter of what we choose to do.

00:44:00.759 --> 00:44:05.239
So this morning as we look at Numbers 21, again, a familiar portion of Scripture, but

00:44:05.239 --> 00:44:12.199
as we focus in on the behavior of Moses, I hope this morning that we've been encouraged

00:44:12.199 --> 00:44:17.799
by Moses' behavior, that we would be thankful and rejoice just as the nation of Israel would

00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:18.799
have.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.479
Oh, Moses, we're thankful that you prayed because you got an answer.

00:44:21.479 --> 00:44:26.139
Oh, Moses, we're thankful that you obeyed because we have a solution, we have a remedy.

00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:32.000
We're thankful that you're faithful, Moses, because how would we have known otherwise?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.179
And we're encouraged by it.

00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:39.399
But I hope this morning we'd be challenged by it in our own lives, and we'd examine ourselves.

00:44:39.399 --> 00:44:43.880
Lord, how am I doing with the ministry of intercessory prayer?

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.799
Am I really going to God on the behalf of others?

00:44:46.799 --> 00:44:50.160
What does my prayer life look like?

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.440
God, how's my obedience?

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.440
Is it immediate?

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.040
Is it complete?

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.760
God, how's my faithfulness?

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:06.320
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I hope that we could identify with Moses more

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:11.639
than with the people, because the people, their soul was much discouraged because of

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:15.359
the way they began to complain.

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:22.479
We have no bread, we have no water, and this light bread, our soul loatheth this light

00:45:22.479 --> 00:45:23.479
bread.

00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:28.880
Oh, I hope that we could identify more with Moses than with the children of Israel, the

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.880
people.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:35.679
Listen, it's easy to complain, it really is, but God says that we're to be thankful, we're

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:40.040
to give thanks in everything, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.040
you.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:46.919
So, this morning, Moses prayed for the people, and I hope that as we examine these three

00:45:46.919 --> 00:45:54.399
aspects of the behavior of Moses, that we just evaluate our own lives, say, God, would

00:45:54.399 --> 00:45:56.239
You use us?

00:45:56.239 --> 00:46:00.600
Would You use us in our little place, in our little opportunity of influence?

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.199
Use us, God, for Your glory.

00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:11.720
Listen, we've been given, we've been entrusted with truth.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.040
When Brother Michael shared from that prayer letter, and I'm thankful that he gave the

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:28.679
numbers, 30 people that are out weekly sharing the gospel, that's encouraging, that's exciting,

00:46:28.679 --> 00:46:36.399
that's convicting, and what a joy to know that we can be faithful in our little place

00:46:36.399 --> 00:46:40.760
where God has put us to do what God's called us to do.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760
Let's pray together.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.760
Father, we love You.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.959
How we thank You for loving us.

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:47.919
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:53.579
We thank You for this great account of Your provision for Your people, and Lord, how they

00:46:53.579 --> 00:47:02.739
confessed their sin and they received an answer as Moses prayed, and God, You provided

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:04.699
them with deliverance.

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:06.820
We thank You for Your grace and for Your mercy.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:14.019
We thank You for the picture of Calvary, and how Jesus referred to this passage of Scripture

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:19.859
speaking about the substitutionary atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary,

00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:22.979
and how thankful we are that Jesus went to that cruel cross.

00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:27.699
He suffered, He bled and died, He was buried in a borrowed tomb, and He rose conquering

00:47:27.699 --> 00:47:29.619
sin, death, and the grave.

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:31.359
We thank You that He lives forevermore.

00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:35.779
We thank You that You have called us to be Your servants and Your ministers, and I pray

00:47:35.779 --> 00:47:39.619
that as we examine this passage this morning that You'd help us, Lord, to be encouraged

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:43.779
by the behavior of Moses more than being encouraged by his behavior.

00:47:43.779 --> 00:47:47.619
I pray, God, that You'd use Your Word to challenge us.

00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:57.540
Lord, that we would evaluate our intercession, our obedience, and our faithfulness.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.899
Lord, use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

00:48:02.899 --> 00:48:08.139
I pray that in these moments that decisions would be made that would please Thee, that

00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:12.380
decisions would be sealed, that, God, You'd be glorified.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.940
We'll thank You for it, in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.940
Would You stand with me?

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.380
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.380
No one's looking around.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.739
We have an opportunity to have a time of invitation, give you an opportunity to respond to the

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:24.419
Lord.

00:48:24.419 --> 00:48:28.700
Perhaps this morning God has used His Word to speak to your heart.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.460
Would you respond?

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.059
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:48:33.059 --> 00:48:34.739
I'll say yes, Lord, yes.
