1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
of Joel. I understand when I made the announcement this morning that Joel was pretty excited

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,960
and actually I don't know if he was or wasn't, but preaching from the book of Joel, he seemed

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,159
like it was quite a surprise. And to be looking at the first several verses of this chapter,

4
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:20,739
it's quite interesting. The book of Joel is one of the oldest of the minor prophets and

5
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:26,200
it is written really predominantly, much of the context is dealing with Judah more than

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,959
Israel, but it's before the Assyrian captivity of Israel, it's before the Babylonian captivity

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:40,099
of Judah. In fact, the date of the writing is somewhere about 100, 110 years prior to

8
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:46,040
the Assyrian captivity of the nation of Israel. And so we find the age of this prophecy is

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,599
one of the first of the written prophecies we see here in the minor prophets. And it's

10
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:54,959
interesting when you begin to think about the content, we'll be just looking at the

11
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:58,799
first chapter, we're not studying through the book of Joel this evening, but it's interesting

12
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,160
for a theme throughout the book is the day of the Lord and really looking as far forward

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,239
from eschatology and looking at the tribulation of the day of the Lord and all of that. And

14
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,120
so it's quite interesting when you think about the eschatological calendar and how that one

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,959
of the oldest written prophets all the way through the day of the Lord. And what a blessing

16
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,080
and someone's phone is competing. Amen. I can talk louder than that Siri or whoever

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,879
that is. Amen. Ron's like, I am so sorry, but it's not my phone. Amen. And so this happened

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,120
to me many years ago, brother Ron, and I was in our church in Pennsylvania and I was sitting

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,680
right on the second row in our chair. It was kind of an auditorium where they kind of had

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,239
a, the center aisle was straight and then there were two side aisles and sitting right

21
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,440
over there. And Holly's phone started ringing and Holly was in the nursery and I was stone

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,760
cold, man. I didn't move. Ron was kind of like, how can I help you? I just kept on listening

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,199
to the preacher and I'm listening to the preacher and pastor says, he stops. He says, Chris,

24
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:09,080
is that your phone? No, sir. I mean, just, and he just, and Juliana's like, but daddy,

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,800
it's mommy's phone. It's not my phone. Amen. It is her phone. In this particular instance,

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,000
the two are not one, amen. But in any case, so I know, I know how it is, you know, it

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,880
doesn't matter what button you push. None of them seem to do anything, you know. But

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,279
Joel chapter number one will be the focus this evening. And you know, it's interesting

29
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:34,440
as you read the Bible in particular, thinking about the old Testament this evening, you

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,320
find periods of time in the record, in the history of the nation of Israel where there's

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,320
great rejoicing. And you see just amazing events and the rejoicing of the people, the

32
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:54,919
revivals in Judah. And you can read about the revivals and you can think about the rejoicing

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,360
and you find that there are times, no doubt, that the people of God had great joy. There

34
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:07,320
are times, however, that as you read through the old Testament, that you'll find that that

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,759
joy is missing. The joy's not there. And such is the case here in Joel chapter number one

36
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,839
as we're looking at what's going on here. In fact, we find that in verse number 12,

37
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:24,839
the Bible says this at the latter part, because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,960
And you read just a few verses down in verse number 16, notice what it says, is not the

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,960
meat cut off before our eyes? Yea, joy and gladness from the house is withered away.

40
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:44,839
Of our God. It's interesting even as I made comment this morning in Psalm 85 in verse

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,240
number 6 with the plea really for revival, that it's directly related to the subject

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,240
of rejoicing. Wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee? The word

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,800
rejoice really, rejoicing is the outward expression of that inward joy. And we find as we begin

44
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,639
to look at this passage of scripture and consider from a national perspective as we get near

45
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,600
the end of the message, we'll deal with it from a personal perspective, but we could

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,519
ask the question, what is it that would cause the joy to wither away? And once we are able

47
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,079
to identify what it is that would cause the joy to wither away, we then ask the question,

48
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:34,079
is how can that joy be restored? Can the joy be restored? I'm thankful that the answer

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,760
to that question is yes, a resounding yes, the joy absolutely can be restored. And we

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,440
find that as we look at this portion of scripture, I'm mindful as we would make application this

51
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,480
evening in our own lives, I've often said over the years that really the most miserable

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,519
person that you'll ever meet is a backslidden Christian. You know, the most miserable person

53
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,720
is not the lost person. There are lost people that are miserable, but there are some that

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,880
don't even know that they're lost and what's all at stake. They just are completely blinded

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,119
to it. But you think about a saved person that's a backslidden. They know what to do.

56
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:19,440
They know what is right, but they're not doing right. They're not walking with God. They've

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,040
grieved and quenched the Spirit of God. The joy is missing from that person and they become

58
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,040
miserable. We find here in Joel, as we'll look at these first 14 verses, I've titled

59
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:37,760
the message, joy is withered away there from verse number 12. But I want you to notice

60
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,200
with me if you're taking notes, notice the situation. I'm going to read through and make

61
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,959
comment. The Bible says the word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. Now

62
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,679
it's interesting as many of the prophets would begin and it speaks about the source of the

63
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:56,279
prophecy. It's the word of the Lord. This is God's word. And we understand all Scripture

64
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,959
is given by inspiration of God. And we find that He's now going to begin to describe for

65
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:07,399
us and help us to understand the situation in which they were dealing with. It says,

66
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:14,399
hear this, ye old men, and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in

67
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:22,040
your days or even in the days of your fathers? I notice in verse number two, the uniqueness

68
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,040
of the situation. You find that this situation is so dire that the verse begins by asking

69
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:36,279
this question, or the book begins with asking this question, hath this been in your days

70
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,679
or even in the days of your fathers? I mean, what is about to be described here, the situation

71
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:47,279
that is going to be unfolded for us in this passage of Scripture, we see the uniqueness

72
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,600
of the situation. And the book says, has it been in your days or even in the days of your

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,519
fathers? You know, I think about our own nation and I think about some applications that we

74
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,320
can make and we see some things that are taking place in our world and in our society. And

75
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,040
we can say, has this ever happened in our days? Have we ever seen this magnitude of

76
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,160
problem? Has it been in our fathers' days? We know that the world has been wicked. We

77
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,079
understand that all the way back in the book of Genesis that Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed

78
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,959
because of the wickedness of man. And even before that, we see the flood that God brought

79
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,440
upon the world because of the wickedness of man. But we see some things that are going

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,920
on and we begin to evaluate those things. And here in the timeline and the circumstances

81
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,839
and we find the uniqueness of the situation that Joel, under the inspiration of God Almighty,

82
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,799
says half this has been in your days or even in the days of your fathers. And then he tells

83
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:51,760
them this, tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and

84
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,160
their children another generation. And you think about the way in which the uniqueness

85
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
again of the situation that it was going to be so unique and it was going to be so intense

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,920
and such a dire set of circumstances that it would be something that would be talked

87
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:17,320
about for generations. That's pretty amazing. Notice in verse number 4, it says that which

88
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,600
the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left

89
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,920
hath the canker worm eaten and that which the canker worm hath left hath the caterpillar

90
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:39,479
eaten. You see the level of destruction. Maybe we've handled one level of this situation

91
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,960
that's come and we've dealt with the palmer worm but now the prophecy says no, after the

92
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,719
palmer worm, whatever they've left, now the locust. And after the locust is done, then

93
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:53,359
the canker worm and then the caterpillar. And you see this progression and you see the

94
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:59,299
utter destruction. It's a unique set of circumstances, it's a unique situation, but there's utter

95
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:05,179
destruction and we find that this idea will continue to unfold for us in the next several

96
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:10,940
verses as we see the extent of the destruction. It's interesting that in verse number 5, it's

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,739
an interesting verse of scripture. The Bible says, awake ye drunkards and weep and how

98
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:23,419
all ye drinkers of wine. It helps us to really get a glimpse into the drunkenness that was

99
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,260
prevalent in those days and to see what was taking place. But notice what it says, because

100
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,500
of the new wine, for it is cut off from your mouth, the destruction that was coming, it

101
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,219
would destroy the vineyards, thus leading to no wine. And he's saying even to these

102
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:46,260
drunkards he's saying, awake! I mean, consider that this which you have been given to, that

103
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,500
because of the extent of this destruction that is coming, you're not even going to be

104
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,580
able to have your wine because it's going to be destroyed. The vineyards are going to

105
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,059
be destroyed. We find that in verses 6 and 7.

106
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,019
and also in v. 10 and 11,

107
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,979
we see the extent of the destruction.

108
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,019
Notice what it says,

109
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,939
"'For a nation has come up upon My land,

110
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,439
strong and without number,

111
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,199
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion,

112
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,279
and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion.

113
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,219
He hath laid My vine waste

114
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,939
and barked My fig tree.

115
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,939
He hath made it clean, bare,

116
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,399
and cast it away.'"

117
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,519
Notice, the branches thereof are made white.

118
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,599
V. 10,

119
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,319
"'The field is wasted.

120
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:30,279
The land mourneth,

121
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,779
for the corn is wasted,

122
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,399
the new wine is dried up,

123
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,199
the oil languisheth.'"

124
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,699
It says this in v. 11,

125
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:37,859
"'Be ye ashamed,

126
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,079
O ye husbandmen, how!

127
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,399
O ye vinedressers,

128
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,159
for the wheat and for the barley.'"

129
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,159
Why?

130
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,699
Because the harvest of the field is perished.

131
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,079
You see, the extent of the destruction,

132
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,279
the uniqueness of the situation,

133
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,199
the utter destruction that is revealed to us

134
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,159
in these verses of Scripture,

135
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,859
and we find that as we continue

136
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,540
really analyzing this passage,

137
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,659
you find that not only would they be affected personally,

138
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,500
not only would even those that were given to wine

139
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,860
be affected as it's mentioned in v. 5,

140
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,579
but tragically, even the offerings

141
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,439
in the house of the Lord would cease.

142
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,360
Why?

143
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,739
Because they don't have the production

144
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,119
in order to bring these offerings.

145
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,360
Notice it says in v. 9,

146
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,819
"'The meat offering and the drink offering

147
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,439
is cut off from the house of the Lord.

148
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:38,079
The priests of the Lord's ministers mourn.'"

149
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,579
Wow.

150
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,239
When you read these verses of Scripture,

151
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,360
you say, this is a bad situation.

152
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,979
I mean, this is dire.

153
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,040
In v. 12, it says,

154
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,540
"'The vine is dried up,

155
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,239
and the fig tree languisheth,

156
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,360
the pomegranate tree,

157
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,159
the palm tree, also in the apple tree,

158
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:57,279
and even all the trees of the field are withered,

159
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,819
because joy is withered away from the sons of men.'"

160
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,279
I want to consider as we think about

161
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,119
this description that is given to us

162
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:09,000
and we note the situation that is explained

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,660
in these verses of Scripture,

164
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,279
I would submit to you this evening

165
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,319
that no doubt this situation is the direct result of sin.

166
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,660
It's the result of sin.

167
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,779
Hold your place here in Joel

168
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,539
because we'll be back here in just a few minutes,

169
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,739
but go over to the book of Leviticus, if you will,

170
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,940
in the 26th chapter.

171
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,360
Leviticus 26.

172
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,479
It's just a little bit before 630.

173
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,580
There are 46 verses in this chapter,

174
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,699
and I'm going to be honest with you,

175
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,660
I don't know where to cut it off.

176
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,899
I'm going to read the entire thing

177
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,860
because it's necessary.

178
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,940
Because we're going to see that this situation in Joel

179
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,199
is the direct result of sin.

180
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:54,699
In Leviticus 26, I want you to notice

181
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,360
the positive nature of the first 13 verses

182
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
of this chapter.

183
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,699
If you were to divide it,

184
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,619
really you would divide Leviticus 26

185
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,239
in verses 1-13,

186
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,739
and then in verses 14 through the end of the chapter.

187
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,399
But I want you to notice what it says.

188
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,779
"...Ye shall make you no idols or a graven image,

189
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,899
neither rear you up a standing image,

190
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,779
neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land

191
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,199
to bow down unto it,

192
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,319
for I am the Lord your God.

193
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,440
You shall keep My Sabbaths

194
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,679
and reverence My sanctuary.

195
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,639
I am the Lord."

196
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,979
And then notice the first word of v. 3.

197
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,440
If.

198
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
That's conditional, correct?

199
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,059
If ye walk in My statutes

200
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,020
and keep My commandments and do them,

201
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,360
what's the first word of v. 4?

202
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,520
Then.

203
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,679
This is a classic if-then promise

204
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,520
in the Word of God.

205
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,020
There are several of them in Proverbs 2.

206
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,440
We see here in Leviticus

207
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
that there are several throughout the entire Bible,

208
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,360
but here in Leviticus 26,

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,940
a classic if-then.

210
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,899
If ye do this,

211
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,099
then God says,

212
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,139
God Almighty,

213
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,940
the Creator and Sustainer of the universe,

214
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,899
the Ruler of all things,

215
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,319
says,

216
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,360
here's what I'm going to do.

217
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,899
Your responsibility?

218
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,559
Walk in My statutes,

219
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,179
keep My commandments,

220
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,480
and do them.

221
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Then, I, again, the Creator God,

222
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,260
I will give you rain in due season.

223
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,940
And the land shall yield her increase

224
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,679
and the trees of the field

225
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,179
shall yield their fruit.

226
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,440
Was that happening in Joel 1?

227
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,899
No.

228
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,720
Continue.

229
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,260
V. 5,

230
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,440
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage,

231
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time,

232
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,679
and ye shall eat your bread to the full

233
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,359
and dwell in your land safely.

234
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,940
And I will give peace in the land,

235
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,179
and ye shall lie down,

236
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,760
and none shall make you afraid.

237
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
And I will rid evil beasts out of the land,

238
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,440
neither shall the sword go through your land.

239
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
And ye shall chase your enemies,

240
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,859
and they shall fall before you by the sword.

241
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:02,440
And five of you shall chase an hundred,

242
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,859
and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to fight,

243
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:09,359
and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

244
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,059
For I will have respect unto you

245
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,139
and make you fruitful

246
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,059
and multiply you

247
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,820
and establish My covenant with you.

248
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,399
And ye shall eat old store

249
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,320
and bring forth the old because of the new.

250
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,279
And I will set My tabernacle among you,

251
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,320
and My soul shall not abhor you.

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,820
And I will walk among you

253
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,119
and will be your God,

254
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,739
and ye shall be My people.

255
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:28,160
I am the Lord your God,

256
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,399
which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt,

257
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,359
that you should not be their bondmen,

258
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,200
and I have broken the bands of your yoke

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,739
and made you go upright."

260
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,239
Isn't that awesome?

261
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,399
You say, man, I'm signing up for that.

262
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,160
Amen?

263
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,339
I want that.

264
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,919
I want verse 4 through verse 13.

265
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,839
Then, I want all of it.

266
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't want part of it.

267
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
I don't want half of it.

268
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,459
I want all of it.

269
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,500
Amen?

270
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,459
I want the blessing of God.

271
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,000
I want God's favor.

272
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,540
I want God to walk among us.

273
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,000
I want God to be welcomed in my home

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,959
in our church

275
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,959
and to have that sweet communion and fellowship

276
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,459
that we spoke of this morning.

277
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,619
I want God's blessing.

278
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,160
It's dependent upon our obedience.

279
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,919
It's an if-then promise.

280
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,040
And verse 14 begins with this word,

281
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,540
but.

282
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
I would encourage you,

283
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,959
I have it in my Bible.

284
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,119
I have circled verse 3, if.

285
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,459
I have circled verse 4, then.

286
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,660
And I have circled verse 14, but.

287
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,160
If ye do this, then, God says,

288
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,500
not Moses says I'm going to do all these things.

289
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,459
No, God Almighty, the omnipotent,

290
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,839
omniscient God says I will do all these things,

291
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,040
but, verse 14.

292
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,720
And then you see that word again, if.

293
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,839
But if ye will not hearken unto Me

294
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,380
and will not do all these commandments,

295
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,959
and if ye shall despise My statutes,

296
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,339
or if your soul abhor My judgments

297
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,299
so that you will not do all My commandments,

298
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,019
and that you break My commandment,

299
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:17,100
notice, I also will do this unto you.

300
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Now, I'm going to tell you,

301
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,299
you don't want to read verses 16-46.

302
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,139
You don't want any of it.

303
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,220
But God is gracious to tell His people

304
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,299
what the consequences are.

305
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,600
God was faithful to give the commandments, was He not?

306
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Amen.

307
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,440
He is faithful to give His Word.

308
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,119
In Deuteronomy, we find that Moses says,

309
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,700
listen, His Word is not far off.

310
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,820
No, no, His Word is nigh unto thee.

311
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,279
I'm thankful that we have the Bible.

312
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,359
The Word of God.

313
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,119
And God says if you do this,

314
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,820
then I'm going to do this.

315
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,019
Praise God for the first part of Leviticus 26.

316
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,940
But if you refuse, if you disobey,

317
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,320
if you abhor, if you despise,

318
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
then He says in the same way,

319
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,399
the same promise,

320
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,540
the same magnitude of the promise of v. 4,

321
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,160
He gives in v. 16,

322
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,200
I also will do this unto you.

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,320
I will even appoint over you terror,

324
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,859
consumption,

325
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:25,160
the burning egg-yew

326
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,859
that shall consume the eyes

327
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,500
and cause sorrow of heart.

328
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,460
And you shall sow your seed in vain,

329
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,039
for your enemies shall eat it.

330
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,599
I will set My face against you,

331
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,059
and you shall be slain before your enemies.

332
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,799
They that hate you shall reign over you,

333
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,900
and you shall flee when none pursueth you.

334
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,039
And if you will not yet for all this hearken unto Me,

335
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,940
then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

336
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,239
What's He saying?

337
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,479
I'm going to do these things,

338
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,580
and the purpose is to bring you back to Me.

339
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,099
Right? That you would return unto Me.

340
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,820
That chastening that we speak about as a believer.

341
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,719
Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

342
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,679
And we understand that not only in Proverbs,

343
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,039
that's an Old Testament and New Testament principle.

344
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

345
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,299
And you find it in Proverbs.

346
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:17,640
You find it in Hebrews.

347
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,299
And you say, listen, God is doing something

348
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,219
to get our attention.

349
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,760
To bring us back to Him.

350
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,719
And He says, if I do all of these things,

351
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,960
and you still, for all of this,

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,640
it says, and if you will not yet for all this

353
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
hearken unto Me,

354
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

355
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,179
V. 19,

356
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,500
And I will break the pride of your power,

357
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,340
and I will make your heaven as iron,

358
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,739
and your earth as brass.

359
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:49,820
And your strength shall be spent in vain,

360
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,539
for your land shall not yield her increase,

361
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,419
neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

362
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,380
And if you walk contrary unto Me,

363
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,940
and will not hearken unto Me,

364
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,299
I will bring seven times more.

365
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,899
seven times more plagues upon you

366
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,419
according to your sins.

367
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,519
I will also send wild beasts among you

368
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,059
which shall rob you of your children

369
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,379
and destroy your cattle

370
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:10,859
and make you few in number,

371
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,899
and your highways shall be desolate.

372
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:15,319
And if you will not be reformed by Me

373
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,379
by these things,

374
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,299
but will walk contrary unto Me,

375
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,779
then will I also walk contrary unto you

376
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,779
and will punish you yet seven times more

377
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:23,739
for your sins."

378
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:27,139
You say, we don't have to read anymore.

379
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,979
Really, honestly.

380
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,019
That's enough.

381
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,299
There's 20-plus more verses.

382
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,219
God is holy.

383
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:43,739
Notice v. 25,

384
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:45,339
And I will bring a sword upon you

385
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,639
that shall avenge the quarrel of My covenant.

386
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,259
And when you are gathered together

387
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,179
within your cities,

388
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,099
I will send the pestilence among you,

389
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,579
and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

390
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,899
When I have broken the staff of your bread,

391
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,219
men and women shall bake your bread in one oven

392
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:02,019
and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight,

393
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,339
and you shall eat and not be satisfied.

394
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,019
And if you will not for all this

395
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:09,019
hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me,

396
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,139
then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury,

397
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,699
and I even I will chastise you seven times for your sins.

398
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,139
It's almost like if I could use this analogy,

399
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,859
God's just turning up the heat on the oven.

400
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,139
Right? You understand what I'm saying?

401
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,019
Why? Because God wants us to return to Him.

402
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,659
God's not doing these things.

403
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,739
He's not telling them this is going to be the consequence

404
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,379
because He's a mean, angry God.

405
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:38,219
No, He wants His people to return to Him.

406
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,059
And He's saying, here's what I'm going to do.

407
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,219
I'm going to make you uncomfortable.

408
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:42,939
I'm going to bring judgment.

409
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:44,739
I'm going to do these things.

410
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,779
And through these things,

411
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,979
it ought to be a wake-up call of,

412
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:50,819
man, I need to examine what's going on.

413
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,579
Why are we dealing with these problems?

414
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,259
Why do we have these troubles?

415
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,899
This is the hand of God.

416
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,939
And if you read it in 2 Chronicles 7,

417
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:01,179
which I touched on this morning,

418
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,019
and you read all that's taking place,

419
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,539
and really when you connect that with Nehemiah,

420
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,299
when Nehemiah prays,

421
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,539
Nehemiah is praying according to the Word of God.

422
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,099
Nehemiah says, God, You said that if we're in this condition

423
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,459
and we turn to You and we pray and we seek Your face,

424
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,379
that You will do this.

425
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:20,139
What's Nehemiah doing?

426
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,979
He's saying, God, I'm taking You at Your Word.

427
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,099
I am praying Your Word back to You

428
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,259
and this is what we're doing.

429
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,659
Notice in verse 29,

430
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,939
and you shall eat the flesh of your sons,

431
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,339
and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.

432
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:40,259
You can read of that in 2 Kings.

433
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,059
The one woman boiled her son and they ate him

434
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,059
and the next woman was going to do it the next day

435
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,419
and they were going to eat him and she didn't

436
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,539
and it was a big problem for the king.

437
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,819
That's terrible.

438
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,219
Verse 30, and I will destroy your high places

439
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,899
and cut down your images

440
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:57,859
and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols

441
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,859
and My soul shall abhor you

442
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,539
and I will make your cities waste

443
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,619
and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation

444
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,179
and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors

445
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,099
and I will bring the land into desolation

446
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,699
and your enemies which dwell therein

447
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,259
shall be astonished at it

448
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,379
and I will scatter you among the heathen

449
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:15,339
and will draw out a sword after you

450
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,699
and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.

451
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,779
Can I ask you, did God do that?

452
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,739
Sure He did.

453
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,699
Babylonian captivity.

454
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,579
It's exactly what happened.

455
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,379
Why? Because for all of this, they returned not.

456
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:33,299
Verse 34, then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths

457
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,939
as long as it lieth desolate,

458
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,859
ye be in your enemies' land,

459
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,419
even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths.

460
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,179
That's why it was a 70 year captivity

461
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,019
for the nation of Judah in Babylon.

462
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,139
That's why Jeremiah, through the inspiration of God,

463
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:48,139
was preaching about 70 years.

464
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,099
And that's why Daniel understood in Daniel 9 or 10,

465
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,859
he understood by reading of the books

466
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,139
that 70 years were accomplished.

467
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,339
That 70 years was directly related

468
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,979
to what we're reading here in Leviticus 26

469
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:05,539
because of the land not having her sabbaths.

470
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,579
Verse 35, as long as it lieth desolate,

471
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,899
it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths

472
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:11,179
when you dwelt upon it.

473
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:13,219
And upon them that are left alive of you,

474
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,139
I will send a faintness into your hearts

475
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,379
and the lands of their enemies

476
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,899
and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them

477
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,339
and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword

478
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:23,539
and they shall fall when none pursueth

479
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,979
and they shall fall one upon another

480
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,779
as it were before a sword when none pursueth

481
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,500
and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies

482
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,299
and you shall perish among the heathen

483
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,619
and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

484
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:39,179
And they that are left of you shall pine away

485
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,059
in their iniquity in your enemies' lands

486
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,220
and also in the iniquities of their fathers

487
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,779
shall they pine away with them

488
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:47,019
if they shall confess their iniquity

489
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,179
and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass

490
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,579
which they trespassed against me

491
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:55,500
and that also they have walked contrary unto me

492
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,659
and that I also have walked contrary unto them

493
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,220
and have brought them into the land of their enemies.

494
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,379
If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled

495
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,940
and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity,

496
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,500
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob

497
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,899
and also my covenant with Isaac

498
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,539
and also my covenant with Abraham

499
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:16,579
will I remember and I will remember the land.

500
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:18,940
You read Daniel's prayer in Daniel chapter number nine,

501
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,220
it's exactly related to what we're reading in Leviticus 26.

502
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,220
Verse 43, the land also shall be left of them

503
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,500
and shall enjoy her sabbaths

504
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,419
while she lieth desolate without them

505
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,739
and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity

506
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,459
because even because they despised my judgments

507
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:38,699
and because their soul abhorred my statutes

508
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,220
and yet for all that when they be in the land

509
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,099
of their enemies, I will not cast them away,

510
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,619
neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly

511
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,339
and to break my covenant with them

512
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,859
for I am the Lord their God.

513
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,019
But I will for their sakes

514
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,299
remember the covenant of their ancestors

515
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,139
whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt

516
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,299
in the sight of the heathen that I might be their God,

517
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,500
I am the Lord.

518
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,379
These are the statutes and judgments and laws

519
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:02,739
which the Lord made between him

520
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,699
and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai

521
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,459
by the hand of Moses.

522
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:09,459
I understand that as we look at the book of Joel

523
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:12,299
and I understand that as we look at the passage here

524
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,819
in Leviticus chapter number 26,

525
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,940
I understand the context

526
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,139
and I understand being written to Israel

527
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:22,699
and I understand that listen, America is not Israel.

528
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:25,019
I understand all of those things.

529
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,299
But the reality is that our God changes not.

530
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,339
The reality is that our God is a holy God.

531
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,419
The reality is that we have,

532
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,539
we understand that the righteous God

533
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,539
loveth righteousness and he will exalt a righteous nation

534
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:45,419
but he will bring low a sinful nation.

535
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,139
And we find that these principles,

536
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,859
these truths that we find in the word of God

537
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,859
are impactful and helpful for us to understand.

538
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,019
And so as we begin to evaluate what's taking place here

539
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,419
in the book of Joel in the first chapter

540
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,699
and we notice this situation that is unfolding for us

541
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:07,500
and we say, listen, somebody needs to wake up here.

542
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,659
Somebody needs to understand

543
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,899
that this is the judgment of God.

544
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,339
Righteousness exalteth a nation

545
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:22,099
but sin is a reproach to any people.

546
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,379
That verse does not say righteousness exalteth Israel

547
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,220
and sin is a reproach to Israel.

548
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,459
It says righteousness exalteth a nation

549
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,819
and sin is a reproach to any people.

550
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,859
Therefore, I believe that we can take

551
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:40,859
and apply the truth of Proverbs 14.34 in our own lives.

552
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,779
And we begin to think about this situation

553
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:47,859
and we begin to understand from Joel chapter number one

554
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,619
as we analyze and understand what's going on here,

555
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:54,979
we would conclude that this is the result of sin.

556
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,059
The result of sin.

557
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,619
I wonder, as we think about all of the things

558
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,619
that have taken place in our nation,

559
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:10,459
it seems as if there's a lack of a turning to God.

560
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,899
I remember, I shared this with somebody just a few days ago,

561
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:20,539
but I remember September 11th, 2001.

562
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,659
I remember exactly where I was.

563
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,720
Many of you do as well.

564
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,239
You remember that day and all that took place.

565
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,899
There's something interesting that happened after that day.

566
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,539
There were people looking for church houses to go to.

567
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:35,299
There really were.

568
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
There was an increase in church attendance

569
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,779
shortly after those attacks.

570
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:43,979
People that just wanted to go pray.

571
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:45,179
People that didn't go to church.

572
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,619
People that didn't pray, but because of the circumstances,

573
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,140
because of the situation.

574
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,619
But you look at what's happened

575
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,779
in the last 18 months in America,

576
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:58,140
not just with COVID, but with all of the stuff

577
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,979
that's gone on.

578
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:01,299
There are fewer people in church today,

579
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,260
by far, across the board, by far.

580
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,700
We see a nation that is saying,

581
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,859
what can we do to fix these problems?

582
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,299
What is the cause of these troubles,

583
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,299
global warming, or some other excuse, reason,

584
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:29,779
anything to not acknowledge the judgment of God?

585
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:35,899
America, I believe, is a nation

586
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,940
that is ripe for the judgment of God.

587
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,539
Do you understand that historically,

588
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,339
if you look at the nations of the world,

589
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,380
that our nation, though we have plenty of problems

590
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,099
and we've had plenty of problems,

591
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,659
our nation is unique compared to many other nations

592
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:49,500
in this world.

593
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,820
We have a lot of problems.

594
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,140
We have a lot of problems.

595
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,779
We are unique compared to many other nations

596
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:57,580
in this world, and we have been given a lot of truth.

597
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:05,860
We've been given a lot of truth, and to whom much is given, much is required.

598
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,380
There are people groups and lands across this globe as you would consider the need for missions,

599
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,660
there are people groups across this globe that do not have the light that we've had

600
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,140
in America.

601
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,380
And therefore I do not believe that they are in the same place of judgment that we are

602
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
in.

603
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,940
Certainly they're accountable, I understand that, I'm not making an excuse for those people

604
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,180
groups, but I'm simply saying to whom much has been given, much is required.

605
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:41,860
And we started with God, but we left God, right?

606
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,700
Israel started with God, and they left God.

607
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,300
You think about the prevalent sin of Judah and Israel throughout their history was that

608
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,700
of idolatry.

609
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:02,100
They had forgotten God, they had forsaken God, and they had followed after idols.

610
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,660
Could that not be the description of the land in which we call home?

611
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:17,300
And yet for all of this, it seems as if there's a lack of repentance, and a lack of truly

612
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,060
seeing that we need to turn to God.

613
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,500
God is the answer.

614
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,300
I don't have time, but in Amos chapter number four, maybe you want to jot it down.

615
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:39,220
In Amos chapter number four, God goes through a series of dialogue, and in quick summary

616
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:47,780
review He says there was famine, there was drought, there was blight, there was pestilence,

617
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,660
and there was destruction.

618
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:58,820
Yet for all of this have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord.

619
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,300
Read Amos four.

620
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,340
That statement of yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord is listed really after

621
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
each of those.

622
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,400
The famine, the drought, the blight, the pestilence, the destruction.

623
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,100
And then you come down to verse number 12 of Amos four, and it says, therefore, in the

624
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,300
very end of the verses, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

625
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,100
This is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

626
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,700
Our God is a consuming fire.

627
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:35,420
The situation in Joel 1 is, it's unique, it's utter destruction, it's dire.

628
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,060
Joy is withered away, but there's a solution.

629
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,780
We see the situation.

630
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,500
I want you to note the solution in verses 13 and 14 back in Joel 1.

631
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,860
The solution that was given in Leviticus 26 near the end of the chapter, as we mentioned,

632
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,340
is that turning back, that repentance, that acknowledgement of the sin, the iniquity,

633
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,540
the transgression, and turning back to God, a confession.

634
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,980
We see that in Daniel 9.

635
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,340
We see that in Nehemiah 1, where they're confessing, they're saying, we, God, have forsaken you.

636
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,460
God, we're coming back to you.

637
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,980
We want your blessing.

638
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:22,100
Notice in verses 13 and 14, the solution, gird yourselves and lament, ye priests, how

639
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,100
ye ministers of the altar, come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God, for

640
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,660
the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.

641
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,260
We know as you read through the scriptures and you read about sackcloth, it's typical

642
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,380
of that of sorrow and repentance.

643
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,420
In fact, you see that in Jonah chapter number three, when the king of Nineveh, he declares

644
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,460
that they were going to be covered in sackcloth and ashes.

645
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Why?

646
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,780
Because of a message from a prophet that was disobedient and God had to smack around and

647
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,780
get them to go into Nineveh, and the message was simple, yet 40 days and Nineveh shall

648
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,300
be destroyed.

649
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,020
Simple message, but passionate, no doubt.

650
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,620
You'd be passionate if you spent some time in the belly of a great fish too, amen?

651
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:18,340
They repented, they had revival.

652
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:29,100
Notice verse number 14, sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly.

653
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:34,460
Notice what it says, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house

654
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,980
of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord.

655
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,900
It must begin at the house of God, according to what Peter tells us, and I believe that

656
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,980
as we look at a passage of scripture from the Old Testament such as this and we understand

657
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,860
what's going on and we note the situation and we note the solution, I trust that we

658
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:03,380
as the people of God would understand the need to return to God.

659
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,020
We'd understand that the answer in our world is Christ.

660
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,620
It's not more politics, it's not more red tape, it's not more vaccinations, it's not

661
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:19,140
more medicines, it's not more, it's not all those things.

662
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,180
It's God.

663
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,800
It's God, and we need to turn to Him.

664
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,700
We see this on a national level here and we've made some applications for what we've dealt

665
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,860
with, but I want you to think about the personal level.

666
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,420
Go back to Psalm 51 if you will.

667
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,580
We visited Psalm 51 this morning, I told you we'd be back tonight.

668
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:54,340
In Psalm 51, it's the psalm of repentance penned by David after the prophet Nathan.

669
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:02,320
With courage and boldness says, Thou art the man.

670
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,160
We find here in this passage of Scripture, as we mentioned this morning, we looked at

671
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,160
a number of the verses, but you find it begins in verse number one, Have mercy upon me, O

672
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,400
God, according to Thy loving kindness, according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies,

673
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,160
blot out my transgressions.

674
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,240
Aren't you thankful that our God is merciful?

675
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,440
The loving kindness of God.

676
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,320
We go to Him on the basis of that.

677
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,320
He says, Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, cleanse me from my sin, for I acknowledge

678
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
my transgressions.

679
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,320
My sin is ever before me against Thee.

680
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,840
Thee only have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight, that Thou mightest be justified

681
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,760
when Thou speakest and be clear when Thou judgest.

682
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,280
Behold, I was shaped in an iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

683
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,320
Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part Thou shalt make

684
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
me to know wisdom.

685
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,560
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.

686
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,600
Wash me now, excuse me, wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

687
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,480
Make me to hear joy and gladness.

688
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Verse 16 of Joel 1, joy and gladness were missing.

689
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,040
Make me to hear joy and gladness.

690
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,720
It says this, as we continue in verse number 8, that the bones which Thou hast broken may

691
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
rejoice.

692
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,920
Hide Thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities.

693
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,320
Make in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

694
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

695
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,880
Notice verse number 12, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy

696
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,960
free spirit.

697
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,240
Why is it that in verse number 12, does David cry out, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation?

698
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,040
Shall I ask it this way, is there joy in knowing Jesus?

699
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,320
Is there joy in being saved?

700
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,680
Absolutely.

701
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,800
In his presence, Psalm 16, is fullness of joy, and we understand that he gives us joy.

702
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,920
It's a joy unspeakable and full of glory.

703
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,280
He says to the disciples when they come back, talking about all of the powers that he had

704
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,600
given them, and they're rejoicing in those things, and Jesus says, rejoice not in this,

705
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:18,560
but rather, rejoice that your names are written in heaven.

706
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,920
There's a new name written down in glory, and it's mine.

707
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,360
You remember when he got saved, and that joy.

708
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,200
David doesn't pray in Psalm 51, 12, restore me my salvation.

709
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,280
No.

710
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,160
You're saved, you're saved.

711
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,840
You're kept by the power of God.

712
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,700
But he says, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

713
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,239
He lost his joy.

714
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,239
He lost his joy.

715
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,239
Why?

716
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,920
Well, you'd have to go back to 2 Samuel 11.

717
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,960
We don't have time tonight, because we read all of Leviticus 26.

718
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,200
But if you go back to 2 Samuel 11, and you read about the sin of David with Bathsheba,

719
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:15,720
the way in which he had Uriah the Hittite murdered, you will find why David lost his

720
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
joy.

721
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,600
And in one word, it's sin.

722
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:29,619
The same reason that the nation in Joel 1 was dealing with that utter destruction, sin.

723
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:38,700
And we find that David prays, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

724
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,100
I'm thankful that our God is interested in restoration.

725
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,960
He's a restoring God.

726
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,020
And I'm thankful for the truth that God gives us in His Word with regard to His restoration.

727
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,619
It's interesting, as you continue to read down through Psalm 51, skip down if you will

728
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,619
to verse number 15.

729
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:57,619
It says,

730
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,359
down my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise." Notice what it says,

731
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,959
for thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it. Thou delightest not in

732
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:10,679
burnt offering. Now let me ask you a question, who ordained sacrifice and

733
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:18,479
burnt offering? God. That was God's institution. I mean, He ordained it.

734
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:24,319
Why is David saying that thou desirest not those things? Because God cares more

735
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:30,799
about your heart than He does about your offering. He cares more about your heart

736
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:36,119
than He does about those outward things. He says the sacrifices of God in verse

737
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:43,519
17 are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God, thou wilt not

738
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:49,879
despise. You can bring every offering you want, but if your heart's far from God, He

739
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:55,399
says that's not a sweet-smelling savor to me. Do good in thy good pleasure and

740
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:59,719
design. Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Notice the then in verse number 19. Then

741
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:04,879
shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt

742
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,959
offering and whole burnt offering. Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine

743
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:12,799
altar. Why is he going to be pleased in verse number 19, but he's not going to

744
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:19,119
desire them in verse number 16? Because there's a right heart. There's the

745
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,959
sacrifice that's mentioned in verse number 17 of that broken spirit, a broken

746
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:27,839
and a contrite heart. We talked this morning about that cultivation of the

747
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,199
heart. We find that God is able to restore unto David the joy of his

748
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,999
salvation. Why did he lose the joy? What was the cause of the joy from a

749
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:44,399
personal perspective? We looked at Joel in the the national perspective, but we

750
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:48,799
look at the personal perspective and we say, hey, believer, Christian, have you

751
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:57,199
lost your joy? Why? The cares of this world, the sin. I read something this

752
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,719
afternoon and it really convicted me. Here's what it said. You know what worry

753
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:12,319
reveals? Your lack of faith. I said, smack. What does worry reveal? Your lack of

754
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,279
faith. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Stepped on my toes, just

755
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:27,720
stepped on my toes again. Joel 2, in verse number 25, we'll close with this.

756
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,440
What a great promise of God. I understand the context being more in a futuristic

757
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:45,440
perspective with the prophecy and view, but when David said in Psalm 51 12,

758
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,399
restoring to me the joy of thy salvation, we find that our God is a

759
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:56,839
restoring God. And in Joel 2 in verse 25, he says, I will restore to you the years

760
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:04,360
that the locust hath eaten, the canker worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer

761
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:14,799
worm, my great army which I sent among you. Who sent it? God. Well, it was because

762
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:24,599
of, no, no, God. God. In Joel chapter number one, when we were reading in verse

763
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,039
number four, we read about the palmer worm, the locust, the canker worm, and the

764
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,319
caterpillar. And we see here in verse number 25 of chapter number two, the

765
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:39,080
locust, the canker worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer worm. And God says, I will

766
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:48,159
restore to you the years that these things have eaten. Our God is a restoring

767
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:57,559
God. If your joy is missing, if your joy is withered away, you know that. There may

768
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,239
be some other people that know that too, quite honestly. It's hard to hide that

769
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,679
all the time. If your joy is gone, it's hard to hide that. You might get good at

770
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,440
it for a little while. It's hard to hide it. But I would submit to you this

771
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:20,079
evening that you know, I know, if my joy is missing. And what is it that took my

772
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:32,919
joy? Sin. Sin. And David says, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Oh, that God

773
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:39,399
would help us to understand, listen, we serve a holy God. I understand this message is not

774
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:44,959
the most popular message. I get it. Leviticus 26, they should read that in Congress every

775
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:56,000
day next week. It would be wonderful. Amen? Seriously. It might do us good if we read

776
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,399
some portions of God's Word, understanding that we serve a God who is holy. Judgment

777
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:10,720
must begin at the house of God. Oh, that we as the people of God would follow as David

778
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,199
did, as Nehemiah did, as Daniel did. Say, God, we've sinned. When's the last time we

779
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:24,079
wept over the sin of our nation? The wickedness that's so prevalent. I understand we complain

780
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,479
about it all the time. But when have we wept about it and confessed it? God, we live in

781
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:41,359
a wicked land. Wicked land. We really do. God is righteous. Righteousness exalteth the

782
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:48,459
nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank

783
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:56,979
you for loving us. Maybe there's one here as we think about it from a personal perspective

784
00:45:56,979 --> 00:46:11,899
that their joy has been lost. Their joy is withered away. I thank you that you are able

785
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:22,459
to restore that joy. I pray that we'd be honest, humble with you tonight. And over

786
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:29,100
these few moments of our invitation that we would truly allow the Holy Spirit of God to

787
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:39,139
have His will and way. We live in a wicked world, amongst a wicked people. They need

788
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:48,419
to see the light of Jesus Christ in our lives. We need to shine bright. We don't need the

789
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:57,940
lens to be dirty. Help us, God, to be clean. We'll commit these times to you, for it's

790
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,979
in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
