WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
of Joel. I understand when I made the announcement this morning that Joel was pretty excited

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:10.960
and actually I don't know if he was or wasn't, but preaching from the book of Joel, he seemed

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.159
like it was quite a surprise. And to be looking at the first several verses of this chapter,

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.739
it's quite interesting. The book of Joel is one of the oldest of the minor prophets and

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:26.200
it is written really predominantly, much of the context is dealing with Judah more than

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.959
Israel, but it's before the Assyrian captivity of Israel, it's before the Babylonian captivity

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:40.099
of Judah. In fact, the date of the writing is somewhere about 100, 110 years prior to

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:46.040
the Assyrian captivity of the nation of Israel. And so we find the age of this prophecy is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.599
one of the first of the written prophecies we see here in the minor prophets. And it's

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:54.959
interesting when you begin to think about the content, we'll be just looking at the

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:58.799
first chapter, we're not studying through the book of Joel this evening, but it's interesting

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:04.160
for a theme throughout the book is the day of the Lord and really looking as far forward

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.239
from eschatology and looking at the tribulation of the day of the Lord and all of that. And

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:15.120
so it's quite interesting when you think about the eschatological calendar and how that one

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.959
of the oldest written prophets all the way through the day of the Lord. And what a blessing

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.080
and someone's phone is competing. Amen. I can talk louder than that Siri or whoever

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.879
that is. Amen. Ron's like, I am so sorry, but it's not my phone. Amen. And so this happened

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:38.120
to me many years ago, brother Ron, and I was in our church in Pennsylvania and I was sitting

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.680
right on the second row in our chair. It was kind of an auditorium where they kind of had

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.239
a, the center aisle was straight and then there were two side aisles and sitting right

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:52.440
over there. And Holly's phone started ringing and Holly was in the nursery and I was stone

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.760
cold, man. I didn't move. Ron was kind of like, how can I help you? I just kept on listening

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.199
to the preacher and I'm listening to the preacher and pastor says, he stops. He says, Chris,

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:09.080
is that your phone? No, sir. I mean, just, and he just, and Juliana's like, but daddy,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.800
it's mommy's phone. It's not my phone. Amen. It is her phone. In this particular instance,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.000
the two are not one, amen. But in any case, so I know, I know how it is, you know, it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.880
doesn't matter what button you push. None of them seem to do anything, you know. But

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.279
Joel chapter number one will be the focus this evening. And you know, it's interesting

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:34.440
as you read the Bible in particular, thinking about the old Testament this evening, you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.320
find periods of time in the record, in the history of the nation of Israel where there's

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.320
great rejoicing. And you see just amazing events and the rejoicing of the people, the

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:54.919
revivals in Judah. And you can read about the revivals and you can think about the rejoicing

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.360
and you find that there are times, no doubt, that the people of God had great joy. There

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:07.320
are times, however, that as you read through the old Testament, that you'll find that that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.759
joy is missing. The joy's not there. And such is the case here in Joel chapter number one

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:17.839
as we're looking at what's going on here. In fact, we find that in verse number 12,

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:24.839
the Bible says this at the latter part, because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.960
And you read just a few verses down in verse number 16, notice what it says, is not the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.960
meat cut off before our eyes? Yea, joy and gladness from the house is withered away.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:44.839
Of our God. It's interesting even as I made comment this morning in Psalm 85 in verse

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.240
number 6 with the plea really for revival, that it's directly related to the subject

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.240
of rejoicing. Wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee? The word

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.800
rejoice really, rejoicing is the outward expression of that inward joy. And we find as we begin

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.639
to look at this passage of scripture and consider from a national perspective as we get near

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.600
the end of the message, we'll deal with it from a personal perspective, but we could

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.519
ask the question, what is it that would cause the joy to wither away? And once we are able

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.079
to identify what it is that would cause the joy to wither away, we then ask the question,

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:34.079
is how can that joy be restored? Can the joy be restored? I'm thankful that the answer

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.760
to that question is yes, a resounding yes, the joy absolutely can be restored. And we

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.440
find that as we look at this portion of scripture, I'm mindful as we would make application this

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.480
evening in our own lives, I've often said over the years that really the most miserable

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.519
person that you'll ever meet is a backslidden Christian. You know, the most miserable person

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:02.720
is not the lost person. There are lost people that are miserable, but there are some that

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.880
don't even know that they're lost and what's all at stake. They just are completely blinded

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.119
to it. But you think about a saved person that's a backslidden. They know what to do.

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:19.440
They know what is right, but they're not doing right. They're not walking with God. They've

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.040
grieved and quenched the Spirit of God. The joy is missing from that person and they become

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.040
miserable. We find here in Joel, as we'll look at these first 14 verses, I've titled

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:37.760
the message, joy is withered away there from verse number 12. But I want you to notice

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.200
with me if you're taking notes, notice the situation. I'm going to read through and make

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.959
comment. The Bible says the word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. Now

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:51.679
it's interesting as many of the prophets would begin and it speaks about the source of the

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:56.279
prophecy. It's the word of the Lord. This is God's word. And we understand all Scripture

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:01.959
is given by inspiration of God. And we find that He's now going to begin to describe for

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.399
us and help us to understand the situation in which they were dealing with. It says,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:14.399
hear this, ye old men, and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:22.040
your days or even in the days of your fathers? I notice in verse number two, the uniqueness

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.040
of the situation. You find that this situation is so dire that the verse begins by asking

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:36.279
this question, or the book begins with asking this question, hath this been in your days

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:42.679
or even in the days of your fathers? I mean, what is about to be described here, the situation

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:47.279
that is going to be unfolded for us in this passage of Scripture, we see the uniqueness

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:52.600
of the situation. And the book says, has it been in your days or even in the days of your

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.519
fathers? You know, I think about our own nation and I think about some applications that we

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:01.320
can make and we see some things that are taking place in our world and in our society. And

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.040
we can say, has this ever happened in our days? Have we ever seen this magnitude of

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.160
problem? Has it been in our fathers' days? We know that the world has been wicked. We

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.079
understand that all the way back in the book of Genesis that Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:22.959
because of the wickedness of man. And even before that, we see the flood that God brought

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.440
upon the world because of the wickedness of man. But we see some things that are going

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.920
on and we begin to evaluate those things. And here in the timeline and the circumstances

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.839
and we find the uniqueness of the situation that Joel, under the inspiration of God Almighty,

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:45.799
says half this has been in your days or even in the days of your fathers. And then he tells

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:51.760
them this, tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.160
their children another generation. And you think about the way in which the uniqueness

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
again of the situation that it was going to be so unique and it was going to be so intense

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.920
and such a dire set of circumstances that it would be something that would be talked

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:17.320
about for generations. That's pretty amazing. Notice in verse number 4, it says that which

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.600
the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.920
hath the canker worm eaten and that which the canker worm hath left hath the caterpillar

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:39.479
eaten. You see the level of destruction. Maybe we've handled one level of this situation

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.960
that's come and we've dealt with the palmer worm but now the prophecy says no, after the

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.719
palmer worm, whatever they've left, now the locust. And after the locust is done, then

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:53.359
the canker worm and then the caterpillar. And you see this progression and you see the

00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:59.299
utter destruction. It's a unique set of circumstances, it's a unique situation, but there's utter

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:05.179
destruction and we find that this idea will continue to unfold for us in the next several

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:10.940
verses as we see the extent of the destruction. It's interesting that in verse number 5, it's

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.739
an interesting verse of scripture. The Bible says, awake ye drunkards and weep and how

00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:23.419
all ye drinkers of wine. It helps us to really get a glimpse into the drunkenness that was

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:28.260
prevalent in those days and to see what was taking place. But notice what it says, because

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:34.500
of the new wine, for it is cut off from your mouth, the destruction that was coming, it

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.219
would destroy the vineyards, thus leading to no wine. And he's saying even to these

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:46.260
drunkards he's saying, awake! I mean, consider that this which you have been given to, that

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.500
because of the extent of this destruction that is coming, you're not even going to be

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.580
able to have your wine because it's going to be destroyed. The vineyards are going to

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.059
be destroyed. We find that in verses 6 and 7.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:02.019
and also in v. 10 and 11,

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.979
we see the extent of the destruction.

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:05.019
Notice what it says,

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:06.939
"'For a nation has come up upon My land,

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.439
strong and without number,

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:10.199
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion,

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:12.279
and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.219
He hath laid My vine waste

00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:15.939
and barked My fig tree.

00:10:15.939 --> 00:10:17.939
He hath made it clean, bare,

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:19.399
and cast it away.'"

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:25.519
Notice, the branches thereof are made white.

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.599
V. 10,

00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:28.319
"'The field is wasted.

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:30.279
The land mourneth,

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:31.779
for the corn is wasted,

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:33.399
the new wine is dried up,

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.199
the oil languisheth.'"

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:36.699
It says this in v. 11,

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:37.859
"'Be ye ashamed,

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:40.079
O ye husbandmen, how!

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.399
O ye vinedressers,

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.159
for the wheat and for the barley.'"

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.159
Why?

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:49.699
Because the harvest of the field is perished.

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:53.079
You see, the extent of the destruction,

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:55.279
the uniqueness of the situation,

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.199
the utter destruction that is revealed to us

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.159
in these verses of Scripture,

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.859
and we find that as we continue

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:05.540
really analyzing this passage,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.659
you find that not only would they be affected personally,

00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:12.500
not only would even those that were given to wine

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.860
be affected as it's mentioned in v. 5,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.579
but tragically, even the offerings

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.439
in the house of the Lord would cease.

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:21.360
Why?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.739
Because they don't have the production

00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:27.119
in order to bring these offerings.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.360
Notice it says in v. 9,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.819
"'The meat offering and the drink offering

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:33.439
is cut off from the house of the Lord.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:38.079
The priests of the Lord's ministers mourn.'"

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:39.579
Wow.

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:41.239
When you read these verses of Scripture,

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:44.360
you say, this is a bad situation.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.979
I mean, this is dire.

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:48.040
In v. 12, it says,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.540
"'The vine is dried up,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.239
and the fig tree languisheth,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:52.360
the pomegranate tree,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.159
the palm tree, also in the apple tree,

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:57.279
and even all the trees of the field are withered,

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:01.819
because joy is withered away from the sons of men.'"

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:04.279
I want to consider as we think about

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.119
this description that is given to us

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:09.000
and we note the situation that is explained

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.660
in these verses of Scripture,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.279
I would submit to you this evening

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:17.319
that no doubt this situation is the direct result of sin.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.660
It's the result of sin.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.779
Hold your place here in Joel

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:21.539
because we'll be back here in just a few minutes,

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:23.739
but go over to the book of Leviticus, if you will,

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:25.940
in the 26th chapter.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.360
Leviticus 26.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.479
It's just a little bit before 630.

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:34.580
There are 46 verses in this chapter,

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.699
and I'm going to be honest with you,

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:38.660
I don't know where to cut it off.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.899
I'm going to read the entire thing

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:42.860
because it's necessary.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.940
Because we're going to see that this situation in Joel

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.199
is the direct result of sin.

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:54.699
In Leviticus 26, I want you to notice

00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:57.360
the positive nature of the first 13 verses

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.399
of this chapter.

00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.699
If you were to divide it,

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:01.619
really you would divide Leviticus 26

00:13:01.619 --> 00:13:03.239
in verses 1-13,

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:05.739
and then in verses 14 through the end of the chapter.

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:07.399
But I want you to notice what it says.

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:09.779
"...Ye shall make you no idols or a graven image,

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.899
neither rear you up a standing image,

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:14.779
neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:16.199
to bow down unto it,

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:18.319
for I am the Lord your God.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.440
You shall keep My Sabbaths

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.679
and reverence My sanctuary.

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:21.639
I am the Lord."

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:25.979
And then notice the first word of v. 3.

00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:27.440
If.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.440
That's conditional, correct?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.059
If ye walk in My statutes

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:38.020
and keep My commandments and do them,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.360
what's the first word of v. 4?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.520
Then.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.679
This is a classic if-then promise

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:47.520
in the Word of God.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.020
There are several of them in Proverbs 2.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.440
We see here in Leviticus

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.639
that there are several throughout the entire Bible,

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.360
but here in Leviticus 26,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.940
a classic if-then.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.899
If ye do this,

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:02.099
then God says,

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:03.139
God Almighty,

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:05.940
the Creator and Sustainer of the universe,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.899
the Ruler of all things,

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:09.319
says,

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:11.360
here's what I'm going to do.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.899
Your responsibility?

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:14.559
Walk in My statutes,

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:16.179
keep My commandments,

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:17.480
and do them.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.760
Then, I, again, the Creator God,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.260
I will give you rain in due season.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.940
And the land shall yield her increase

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.679
and the trees of the field

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:32.179
shall yield their fruit.

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:34.440
Was that happening in Joel 1?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.899
No.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:36.720
Continue.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.260
V. 5,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.440
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.600
and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.679
and ye shall eat your bread to the full

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:46.359
and dwell in your land safely.

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:47.940
And I will give peace in the land,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.179
and ye shall lie down,

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.760
and none shall make you afraid.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.220
And I will rid evil beasts out of the land,

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.440
neither shall the sword go through your land.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.519
And ye shall chase your enemies,

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.859
and they shall fall before you by the sword.

00:14:59.859 --> 00:15:02.440
And five of you shall chase an hundred,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.859
and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to fight,

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:09.359
and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:11.059
For I will have respect unto you

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:12.139
and make you fruitful

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:13.059
and multiply you

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:14.820
and establish My covenant with you.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.399
And ye shall eat old store

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:18.320
and bring forth the old because of the new.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.279
And I will set My tabernacle among you,

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.320
and My soul shall not abhor you.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.820
And I will walk among you

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.119
and will be your God,

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:26.739
and ye shall be My people.

00:15:26.739 --> 00:15:28.160
I am the Lord your God,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.399
which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt,

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.359
that you should not be their bondmen,

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:35.200
and I have broken the bands of your yoke

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.739
and made you go upright."

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.239
Isn't that awesome?

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.399
You say, man, I'm signing up for that.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.160
Amen?

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.339
I want that.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:45.919
I want verse 4 through verse 13.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.839
Then, I want all of it.

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:49.000
I don't want part of it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.040
I don't want half of it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.459
I want all of it.

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:52.500
Amen?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.459
I want the blessing of God.

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:56.000
I want God's favor.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.540
I want God to walk among us.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.000
I want God to be welcomed in my home

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.959
in our church

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:05.959
and to have that sweet communion and fellowship

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:07.459
that we spoke of this morning.

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:10.619
I want God's blessing.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.160
It's dependent upon our obedience.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.919
It's an if-then promise.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:19.040
And verse 14 begins with this word,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.540
but.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540
I would encourage you,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.959
I have it in my Bible.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.119
I have circled verse 3, if.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.459
I have circled verse 4, then.

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:32.660
And I have circled verse 14, but.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.160
If ye do this, then, God says,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.500
not Moses says I'm going to do all these things.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.459
No, God Almighty, the omnipotent,

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:46.839
omniscient God says I will do all these things,

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:50.040
but, verse 14.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.720
And then you see that word again, if.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.839
But if ye will not hearken unto Me

00:16:56.839 --> 00:17:00.380
and will not do all these commandments,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.959
and if ye shall despise My statutes,

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:06.339
or if your soul abhor My judgments

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.299
so that you will not do all My commandments,

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.019
and that you break My commandment,

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:17.100
notice, I also will do this unto you.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.100
Now, I'm going to tell you,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.299
you don't want to read verses 16-46.

00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:25.139
You don't want any of it.

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:28.220
But God is gracious to tell His people

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.299
what the consequences are.

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:35.600
God was faithful to give the commandments, was He not?

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600
Amen.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.440
He is faithful to give His Word.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.119
In Deuteronomy, we find that Moses says,

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:44.700
listen, His Word is not far off.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.820
No, no, His Word is nigh unto thee.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.279
I'm thankful that we have the Bible.

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:51.359
The Word of God.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:54.119
And God says if you do this,

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.820
then I'm going to do this.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.019
Praise God for the first part of Leviticus 26.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:00.940
But if you refuse, if you disobey,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.320
if you abhor, if you despise,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.320
then He says in the same way,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.399
the same promise,

00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:11.540
the same magnitude of the promise of v. 4,

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.160
He gives in v. 16,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.200
I also will do this unto you.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.320
I will even appoint over you terror,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.859
consumption,

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:25.160
the burning egg-yew

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.859
that shall consume the eyes

00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:29.500
and cause sorrow of heart.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.460
And you shall sow your seed in vain,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.039
for your enemies shall eat it.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.599
I will set My face against you,

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:40.059
and you shall be slain before your enemies.

00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:42.799
They that hate you shall reign over you,

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:45.900
and you shall flee when none pursueth you.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.039
And if you will not yet for all this hearken unto Me,

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:53.940
then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.239
What's He saying?

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.479
I'm going to do these things,

00:18:56.479 --> 00:18:59.580
and the purpose is to bring you back to Me.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.099
Right? That you would return unto Me.

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:06.820
That chastening that we speak about as a believer.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.719
Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:10.679
And we understand that not only in Proverbs,

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:13.039
that's an Old Testament and New Testament principle.

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.799
Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.299
And you find it in Proverbs.

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:17.640
You find it in Hebrews.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.299
And you say, listen, God is doing something

00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:22.219
to get our attention.

00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:24.760
To bring us back to Him.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.719
And He says, if I do all of these things,

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:28.960
and you still, for all of this,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.640
it says, and if you will not yet for all this

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
hearken unto Me,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.919
then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:38.179
V. 19,

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:41.500
And I will break the pride of your power,

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.340
and I will make your heaven as iron,

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.739
and your earth as brass.

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:49.820
And your strength shall be spent in vain,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.539
for your land shall not yield her increase,

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:55.419
neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:57.380
And if you walk contrary unto Me,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.940
and will not hearken unto Me,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.299
I will bring seven times more.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.899
seven times more plagues upon you

00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:03.419
according to your sins.

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:05.519
I will also send wild beasts among you

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:08.059
which shall rob you of your children

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:09.379
and destroy your cattle

00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:10.859
and make you few in number,

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:12.899
and your highways shall be desolate.

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:15.319
And if you will not be reformed by Me

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.379
by these things,

00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:18.299
but will walk contrary unto Me,

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:20.779
then will I also walk contrary unto you

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:22.779
and will punish you yet seven times more

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:23.739
for your sins."

00:20:23.739 --> 00:20:27.139
You say, we don't have to read anymore.

00:20:27.139 --> 00:20:28.979
Really, honestly.

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:31.019
That's enough.

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:35.299
There's 20-plus more verses.

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:40.219
God is holy.

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:43.739
Notice v. 25,

00:20:43.739 --> 00:20:45.339
And I will bring a sword upon you

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:47.639
that shall avenge the quarrel of My covenant.

00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:49.259
And when you are gathered together

00:20:49.259 --> 00:20:50.179
within your cities,

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:52.099
I will send the pestilence among you,

00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:54.579
and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:56.899
When I have broken the staff of your bread,

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:59.219
men and women shall bake your bread in one oven

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:02.019
and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight,

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:05.339
and you shall eat and not be satisfied.

00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:07.019
And if you will not for all this

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:09.019
hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me,

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.139
then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury,

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:15.699
and I even I will chastise you seven times for your sins.

00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:18.139
It's almost like if I could use this analogy,

00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:20.859
God's just turning up the heat on the oven.

00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:23.139
Right? You understand what I'm saying?

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:27.019
Why? Because God wants us to return to Him.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.659
God's not doing these things.

00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:30.739
He's not telling them this is going to be the consequence

00:21:30.739 --> 00:21:34.379
because He's a mean, angry God.

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:38.219
No, He wants His people to return to Him.

00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:40.059
And He's saying, here's what I'm going to do.

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:41.219
I'm going to make you uncomfortable.

00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:42.939
I'm going to bring judgment.

00:21:42.939 --> 00:21:44.739
I'm going to do these things.

00:21:44.739 --> 00:21:46.779
And through these things,

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:48.979
it ought to be a wake-up call of,

00:21:48.979 --> 00:21:50.819
man, I need to examine what's going on.

00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:52.579
Why are we dealing with these problems?

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:54.259
Why do we have these troubles?

00:21:54.259 --> 00:21:56.899
This is the hand of God.

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.939
And if you read it in 2 Chronicles 7,

00:21:58.939 --> 00:22:01.179
which I touched on this morning,

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:03.019
and you read all that's taking place,

00:22:03.019 --> 00:22:05.539
and really when you connect that with Nehemiah,

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:07.299
when Nehemiah prays,

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:09.539
Nehemiah is praying according to the Word of God.

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:13.099
Nehemiah says, God, You said that if we're in this condition

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:16.459
and we turn to You and we pray and we seek Your face,

00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:18.379
that You will do this.

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:20.139
What's Nehemiah doing?

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:21.979
He's saying, God, I'm taking You at Your Word.

00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:24.099
I am praying Your Word back to You

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:26.259
and this is what we're doing.

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:29.659
Notice in verse 29,

00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:32.939
and you shall eat the flesh of your sons,

00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:35.339
and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:40.259
You can read of that in 2 Kings.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:43.059
The one woman boiled her son and they ate him

00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:45.059
and the next woman was going to do it the next day

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:46.419
and they were going to eat him and she didn't

00:22:46.419 --> 00:22:48.539
and it was a big problem for the king.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.819
That's terrible.

00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:53.219
Verse 30, and I will destroy your high places

00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:54.899
and cut down your images

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:57.859
and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols

00:22:57.859 --> 00:22:59.859
and My soul shall abhor you

00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:01.539
and I will make your cities waste

00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:03.619
and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:06.179
and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors

00:23:06.179 --> 00:23:08.099
and I will bring the land into desolation

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:09.699
and your enemies which dwell therein

00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:11.259
shall be astonished at it

00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:13.379
and I will scatter you among the heathen

00:23:13.379 --> 00:23:15.339
and will draw out a sword after you

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:17.699
and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.

00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:19.779
Can I ask you, did God do that?

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:21.739
Sure He did.

00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:23.699
Babylonian captivity.

00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:25.579
It's exactly what happened.

00:23:25.579 --> 00:23:28.379
Why? Because for all of this, they returned not.

00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:33.299
Verse 34, then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:34.939
as long as it lieth desolate,

00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:36.859
ye be in your enemies' land,

00:23:36.859 --> 00:23:39.419
even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.179
That's why it was a 70 year captivity

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:44.019
for the nation of Judah in Babylon.

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:46.139
That's why Jeremiah, through the inspiration of God,

00:23:46.139 --> 00:23:48.139
was preaching about 70 years.

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:52.099
And that's why Daniel understood in Daniel 9 or 10,

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.859
he understood by reading of the books

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:56.139
that 70 years were accomplished.

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:59.339
That 70 years was directly related

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:01.979
to what we're reading here in Leviticus 26

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:05.539
because of the land not having her sabbaths.

00:24:05.539 --> 00:24:07.579
Verse 35, as long as it lieth desolate,

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:09.899
it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:11.179
when you dwelt upon it.

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:13.219
And upon them that are left alive of you,

00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:15.139
I will send a faintness into your hearts

00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:16.379
and the lands of their enemies

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.899
and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:21.339
and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword

00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:23.539
and they shall fall when none pursueth

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.979
and they shall fall one upon another

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:28.779
as it were before a sword when none pursueth

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:31.500
and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.299
and you shall perish among the heathen

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:36.619
and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:39.179
And they that are left of you shall pine away

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:41.059
in their iniquity in your enemies' lands

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:43.220
and also in the iniquities of their fathers

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.779
shall they pine away with them

00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:47.019
if they shall confess their iniquity

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:50.179
and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass

00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:52.579
which they trespassed against me

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:55.500
and that also they have walked contrary unto me

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.659
and that I also have walked contrary unto them

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:00.220
and have brought them into the land of their enemies.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.379
If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled

00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:07.940
and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.500
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.899
and also my covenant with Isaac

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:13.539
and also my covenant with Abraham

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:16.579
will I remember and I will remember the land.

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.940
You read Daniel's prayer in Daniel chapter number nine,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.220
it's exactly related to what we're reading in Leviticus 26.

00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:27.220
Verse 43, the land also shall be left of them

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.500
and shall enjoy her sabbaths

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.419
while she lieth desolate without them

00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:32.739
and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.459
because even because they despised my judgments

00:25:35.459 --> 00:25:38.699
and because their soul abhorred my statutes

00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:41.220
and yet for all that when they be in the land

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.099
of their enemies, I will not cast them away,

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:45.619
neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:47.339
and to break my covenant with them

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:50.859
for I am the Lord their God.

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:52.019
But I will for their sakes

00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:54.299
remember the covenant of their ancestors

00:25:54.299 --> 00:25:56.139
whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.299
in the sight of the heathen that I might be their God,

00:25:58.299 --> 00:25:59.500
I am the Lord.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.379
These are the statutes and judgments and laws

00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:02.739
which the Lord made between him

00:26:02.739 --> 00:26:04.699
and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai

00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:07.459
by the hand of Moses.

00:26:07.459 --> 00:26:09.459
I understand that as we look at the book of Joel

00:26:09.459 --> 00:26:12.299
and I understand that as we look at the passage here

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:13.819
in Leviticus chapter number 26,

00:26:13.819 --> 00:26:15.940
I understand the context

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.139
and I understand being written to Israel

00:26:19.139 --> 00:26:22.699
and I understand that listen, America is not Israel.

00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:25.019
I understand all of those things.

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:28.299
But the reality is that our God changes not.

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:31.339
The reality is that our God is a holy God.

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:33.419
The reality is that we have,

00:26:33.419 --> 00:26:36.539
we understand that the righteous God

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:41.539
loveth righteousness and he will exalt a righteous nation

00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:45.419
but he will bring low a sinful nation.

00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:48.139
And we find that these principles,

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.859
these truths that we find in the word of God

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.859
are impactful and helpful for us to understand.

00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:57.019
And so as we begin to evaluate what's taking place here

00:26:57.019 --> 00:27:00.419
in the book of Joel in the first chapter

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:03.699
and we notice this situation that is unfolding for us

00:27:03.699 --> 00:27:07.500
and we say, listen, somebody needs to wake up here.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.659
Somebody needs to understand

00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:11.899
that this is the judgment of God.

00:27:15.419 --> 00:27:18.339
Righteousness exalteth a nation

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:22.099
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:25.379
That verse does not say righteousness exalteth Israel

00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:27.220
and sin is a reproach to Israel.

00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:30.459
It says righteousness exalteth a nation

00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:32.819
and sin is a reproach to any people.

00:27:33.699 --> 00:27:35.859
Therefore, I believe that we can take

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:40.859
and apply the truth of Proverbs 14.34 in our own lives.

00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:44.779
And we begin to think about this situation

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:47.859
and we begin to understand from Joel chapter number one

00:27:47.859 --> 00:27:50.619
as we analyze and understand what's going on here,

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:54.979
we would conclude that this is the result of sin.

00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:56.059
The result of sin.

00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:02.619
I wonder, as we think about all of the things

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:04.619
that have taken place in our nation,

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.459
it seems as if there's a lack of a turning to God.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.899
I remember, I shared this with somebody just a few days ago,

00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:20.539
but I remember September 11th, 2001.

00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:21.659
I remember exactly where I was.

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:22.720
Many of you do as well.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.239
You remember that day and all that took place.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.899
There's something interesting that happened after that day.

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:32.539
There were people looking for church houses to go to.

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:35.299
There really were.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.700
There was an increase in church attendance

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.779
shortly after those attacks.

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:43.979
People that just wanted to go pray.

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:45.179
People that didn't go to church.

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:49.619
People that didn't pray, but because of the circumstances,

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:51.140
because of the situation.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.619
But you look at what's happened

00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:55.779
in the last 18 months in America,

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:58.140
not just with COVID, but with all of the stuff

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.979
that's gone on.

00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:01.299
There are fewer people in church today,

00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:06.260
by far, across the board, by far.

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:11.700
We see a nation that is saying,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.859
what can we do to fix these problems?

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:19.299
What is the cause of these troubles,

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:24.299
global warming, or some other excuse, reason,

00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:29.779
anything to not acknowledge the judgment of God?

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:35.899
America, I believe, is a nation

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:37.940
that is ripe for the judgment of God.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.539
Do you understand that historically,

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:41.339
if you look at the nations of the world,

00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:44.380
that our nation, though we have plenty of problems

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.099
and we've had plenty of problems,

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:48.659
our nation is unique compared to many other nations

00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:49.500
in this world.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.820
We have a lot of problems.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.140
We have a lot of problems.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.779
We are unique compared to many other nations

00:29:53.779 --> 00:29:57.580
in this world, and we have been given a lot of truth.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:05.860
We've been given a lot of truth, and to whom much is given, much is required.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.380
There are people groups and lands across this globe as you would consider the need for missions,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.660
there are people groups across this globe that do not have the light that we've had

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.140
in America.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:23.380
And therefore I do not believe that they are in the same place of judgment that we are

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.380
in.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.940
Certainly they're accountable, I understand that, I'm not making an excuse for those people

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:34.180
groups, but I'm simply saying to whom much has been given, much is required.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:41.860
And we started with God, but we left God, right?

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.700
Israel started with God, and they left God.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:52.300
You think about the prevalent sin of Judah and Israel throughout their history was that

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.700
of idolatry.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:02.100
They had forgotten God, they had forsaken God, and they had followed after idols.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.660
Could that not be the description of the land in which we call home?

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:17.300
And yet for all of this, it seems as if there's a lack of repentance, and a lack of truly

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.060
seeing that we need to turn to God.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.500
God is the answer.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:31.300
I don't have time, but in Amos chapter number four, maybe you want to jot it down.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:39.220
In Amos chapter number four, God goes through a series of dialogue, and in quick summary

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:47.780
review He says there was famine, there was drought, there was blight, there was pestilence,

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.660
and there was destruction.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:58.820
Yet for all of this have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.300
Read Amos four.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.340
That statement of yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord is listed really after

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.340
each of those.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.400
The famine, the drought, the blight, the pestilence, the destruction.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.100
And then you come down to verse number 12 of Amos four, and it says, therefore, in the

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:18.300
very end of the verses, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.100
This is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:26.700
Our God is a consuming fire.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:35.420
The situation in Joel 1 is, it's unique, it's utter destruction, it's dire.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:41.060
Joy is withered away, but there's a solution.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.780
We see the situation.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.500
I want you to note the solution in verses 13 and 14 back in Joel 1.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.860
The solution that was given in Leviticus 26 near the end of the chapter, as we mentioned,

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.340
is that turning back, that repentance, that acknowledgement of the sin, the iniquity,

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.540
the transgression, and turning back to God, a confession.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.980
We see that in Daniel 9.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:07.340
We see that in Nehemiah 1, where they're confessing, they're saying, we, God, have forsaken you.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:12.460
God, we're coming back to you.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.980
We want your blessing.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:22.100
Notice in verses 13 and 14, the solution, gird yourselves and lament, ye priests, how

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:28.100
ye ministers of the altar, come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God, for

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.660
the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.260
We know as you read through the scriptures and you read about sackcloth, it's typical

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.380
of that of sorrow and repentance.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.420
In fact, you see that in Jonah chapter number three, when the king of Nineveh, he declares

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.460
that they were going to be covered in sackcloth and ashes.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460
Why?

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.780
Because of a message from a prophet that was disobedient and God had to smack around and

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.780
get them to go into Nineveh, and the message was simple, yet 40 days and Nineveh shall

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.300
be destroyed.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.020
Simple message, but passionate, no doubt.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.620
You'd be passionate if you spent some time in the belly of a great fish too, amen?

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:18.340
They repented, they had revival.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:29.100
Notice verse number 14, sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.460
Notice what it says, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:40.980
of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:46.900
It must begin at the house of God, according to what Peter tells us, and I believe that

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.980
as we look at a passage of scripture from the Old Testament such as this and we understand

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:57.860
what's going on and we note the situation and we note the solution, I trust that we

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.380
as the people of God would understand the need to return to God.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.020
We'd understand that the answer in our world is Christ.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:13.620
It's not more politics, it's not more red tape, it's not more vaccinations, it's not

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.140
more medicines, it's not more, it's not all those things.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.180
It's God.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.800
It's God, and we need to turn to Him.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.700
We see this on a national level here and we've made some applications for what we've dealt

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.860
with, but I want you to think about the personal level.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.420
Go back to Psalm 51 if you will.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.580
We visited Psalm 51 this morning, I told you we'd be back tonight.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:54.340
In Psalm 51, it's the psalm of repentance penned by David after the prophet Nathan.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:02.320
With courage and boldness says, Thou art the man.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.160
We find here in this passage of Scripture, as we mentioned this morning, we looked at

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.160
a number of the verses, but you find it begins in verse number one, Have mercy upon me, O

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.400
God, according to Thy loving kindness, according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.160
blot out my transgressions.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.240
Aren't you thankful that our God is merciful?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.440
The loving kindness of God.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.320
We go to Him on the basis of that.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.320
He says, Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, cleanse me from my sin, for I acknowledge

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.360
my transgressions.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.320
My sin is ever before me against Thee.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.840
Thee only have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight, that Thou mightest be justified

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.760
when Thou speakest and be clear when Thou judgest.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.280
Behold, I was shaped in an iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.320
Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part Thou shalt make

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.320
me to know wisdom.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.560
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:59.600
Wash me now, excuse me, wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.480
Make me to hear joy and gladness.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.480
Verse 16 of Joel 1, joy and gladness were missing.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.040
Make me to hear joy and gladness.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.720
It says this, as we continue in verse number 8, that the bones which Thou hast broken may

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.720
rejoice.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.920
Hide Thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.320
Make in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.000
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.880
Notice verse number 12, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.960
free spirit.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:42.240
Why is it that in verse number 12, does David cry out, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation?

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.040
Shall I ask it this way, is there joy in knowing Jesus?

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.320
Is there joy in being saved?

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.680
Absolutely.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.800
In his presence, Psalm 16, is fullness of joy, and we understand that he gives us joy.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.920
It's a joy unspeakable and full of glory.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.280
He says to the disciples when they come back, talking about all of the powers that he had

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.600
given them, and they're rejoicing in those things, and Jesus says, rejoice not in this,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:18.560
but rather, rejoice that your names are written in heaven.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.920
There's a new name written down in glory, and it's mine.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.360
You remember when he got saved, and that joy.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:32.200
David doesn't pray in Psalm 51, 12, restore me my salvation.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.280
No.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.160
You're saved, you're saved.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.840
You're kept by the power of God.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:46.700
But he says, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.239
He lost his joy.

00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:50.239
He lost his joy.

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:51.239
Why?

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:54.920
Well, you'd have to go back to 2 Samuel 11.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.960
We don't have time tonight, because we read all of Leviticus 26.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:07.200
But if you go back to 2 Samuel 11, and you read about the sin of David with Bathsheba,

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:15.720
the way in which he had Uriah the Hittite murdered, you will find why David lost his

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720
joy.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.600
And in one word, it's sin.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:29.619
The same reason that the nation in Joel 1 was dealing with that utter destruction, sin.

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:38.700
And we find that David prays, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.100
I'm thankful that our God is interested in restoration.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.960
He's a restoring God.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.020
And I'm thankful for the truth that God gives us in His Word with regard to His restoration.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.619
It's interesting, as you continue to read down through Psalm 51, skip down if you will

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:56.619
to verse number 15.

00:39:56.619 --> 00:39:57.619
It says,

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:01.359
down my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise." Notice what it says,

00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:05.959
for thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it. Thou delightest not in

00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:10.679
burnt offering. Now let me ask you a question, who ordained sacrifice and

00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:18.479
burnt offering? God. That was God's institution. I mean, He ordained it.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:24.319
Why is David saying that thou desirest not those things? Because God cares more

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:30.799
about your heart than He does about your offering. He cares more about your heart

00:40:30.799 --> 00:40:36.119
than He does about those outward things. He says the sacrifices of God in verse

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:43.519
17 are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God, thou wilt not

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:49.879
despise. You can bring every offering you want, but if your heart's far from God, He

00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:55.399
says that's not a sweet-smelling savor to me. Do good in thy good pleasure and

00:40:55.399 --> 00:40:59.719
design. Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Notice the then in verse number 19. Then

00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:04.879
shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:08.959
offering and whole burnt offering. Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine

00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:12.799
altar. Why is he going to be pleased in verse number 19, but he's not going to

00:41:12.799 --> 00:41:19.119
desire them in verse number 16? Because there's a right heart. There's the

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:22.959
sacrifice that's mentioned in verse number 17 of that broken spirit, a broken

00:41:22.959 --> 00:41:27.839
and a contrite heart. We talked this morning about that cultivation of the

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:35.199
heart. We find that God is able to restore unto David the joy of his

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:39.999
salvation. Why did he lose the joy? What was the cause of the joy from a

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:44.399
personal perspective? We looked at Joel in the the national perspective, but we

00:41:44.399 --> 00:41:48.799
look at the personal perspective and we say, hey, believer, Christian, have you

00:41:48.799 --> 00:41:57.199
lost your joy? Why? The cares of this world, the sin. I read something this

00:41:57.199 --> 00:42:01.719
afternoon and it really convicted me. Here's what it said. You know what worry

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:12.319
reveals? Your lack of faith. I said, smack. What does worry reveal? Your lack of

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:16.279
faith. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Stepped on my toes, just

00:42:16.279 --> 00:42:27.720
stepped on my toes again. Joel 2, in verse number 25, we'll close with this.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.440
What a great promise of God. I understand the context being more in a futuristic

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:45.440
perspective with the prophecy and view, but when David said in Psalm 51 12,

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.399
restoring to me the joy of thy salvation, we find that our God is a

00:42:49.399 --> 00:42:56.839
restoring God. And in Joel 2 in verse 25, he says, I will restore to you the years

00:42:56.839 --> 00:43:04.360
that the locust hath eaten, the canker worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:14.799
worm, my great army which I sent among you. Who sent it? God. Well, it was because

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:24.599
of, no, no, God. God. In Joel chapter number one, when we were reading in verse

00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:28.039
number four, we read about the palmer worm, the locust, the canker worm, and the

00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:33.319
caterpillar. And we see here in verse number 25 of chapter number two, the

00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:39.080
locust, the canker worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer worm. And God says, I will

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:48.159
restore to you the years that these things have eaten. Our God is a restoring

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:57.559
God. If your joy is missing, if your joy is withered away, you know that. There may

00:43:57.559 --> 00:44:02.239
be some other people that know that too, quite honestly. It's hard to hide that

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:07.679
all the time. If your joy is gone, it's hard to hide that. You might get good at

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:12.440
it for a little while. It's hard to hide it. But I would submit to you this

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:20.079
evening that you know, I know, if my joy is missing. And what is it that took my

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:32.919
joy? Sin. Sin. And David says, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Oh, that God

00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:39.399
would help us to understand, listen, we serve a holy God. I understand this message is not

00:44:39.399 --> 00:44:44.959
the most popular message. I get it. Leviticus 26, they should read that in Congress every

00:44:44.959 --> 00:44:56.000
day next week. It would be wonderful. Amen? Seriously. It might do us good if we read

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.399
some portions of God's Word, understanding that we serve a God who is holy. Judgment

00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:10.720
must begin at the house of God. Oh, that we as the people of God would follow as David

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:18.199
did, as Nehemiah did, as Daniel did. Say, God, we've sinned. When's the last time we

00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:24.079
wept over the sin of our nation? The wickedness that's so prevalent. I understand we complain

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:31.479
about it all the time. But when have we wept about it and confessed it? God, we live in

00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:41.359
a wicked land. Wicked land. We really do. God is righteous. Righteousness exalteth the

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:48.459
nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank

00:45:48.459 --> 00:45:56.979
you for loving us. Maybe there's one here as we think about it from a personal perspective

00:45:56.979 --> 00:46:11.899
that their joy has been lost. Their joy is withered away. I thank you that you are able

00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:22.459
to restore that joy. I pray that we'd be honest, humble with you tonight. And over

00:46:22.459 --> 00:46:29.100
these few moments of our invitation that we would truly allow the Holy Spirit of God to

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:39.139
have His will and way. We live in a wicked world, amongst a wicked people. They need

00:46:39.139 --> 00:46:48.419
to see the light of Jesus Christ in our lives. We need to shine bright. We don't need the

00:46:48.419 --> 00:46:57.940
lens to be dirty. Help us, God, to be clean. We'll commit these times to you, for it's

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.979
in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
