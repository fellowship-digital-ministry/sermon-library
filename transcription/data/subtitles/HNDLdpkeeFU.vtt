WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
23 through 31, and I'm taking this passage to look at this evening.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.319
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message A Prayer for Boldness.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600
A Prayer for Boldness.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.239
The disciples in the first century are facing various aspects of persecution.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.000
Really, what we're looking at here in Acts chapter four is the persecution was

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.879
beginning to build and rise, and of course, we find that it's in the eighth

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.879
chapter, really, when that persecution reaches a high point.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.719
And we find that the the believers are

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.200
scattered around abroad and they go everywhere.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.720
The Bible tells us preaching the word

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:43.439
and what a blessing that is to see how the gospel was going forward.

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:48.080
But as we look at this passage of Scripture, I'll deal with as we look at it,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.400
really kind of in the middle of a bunch of things that are going on.

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.720
And I'll do my best to provide you with all of the backdrop so that we can

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:59.720
understand the prayer that is recorded for us.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.599
In Acts chapter four, verses 23 through 31.

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:06.599
Not only do we read of the prayer, but we see how God answers the prayer.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.279
I'm so thankful for the privilege of prayer.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.239
I'm so thankful that God hears and answers prayer.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.199
We often speak of that truth and we often use that phraseology.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.480
But we ought never

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.879
get over the fact that the God of the universe hears me singularly as I pray.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.959
I mean, just wrap your mind around that for a moment.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.279
That little old me that we get to pray

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.400
to the creator God and he hears us and he answers us.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.599
It's amazing.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.400
And what a joy to understand the privilege of prayer that is ours.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.199
And we find in the text of Scripture, the Bible says in verse number 23,

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:53.800
I'm going to read the text and then I'll give you the backdrop and we'll get

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.919
into the message this evening, but the Bible says and being let go.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.559
They speaking of the disciples,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.000
these, of course, that are specifically mentioned were those that were dealing

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:10.279
with the persecution, Peter and John in that scenario.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.639
And we'll look at that in just a moment.

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.639
But the Bible says they went to their own

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:19.320
company and reported all that the chief priest and elders had said unto them.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.880
And they threatened them is what happened.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.279
And we'll notice that it says in verse 24.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.119
And when they heard that notice what it says in verse 24,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.399
they lifted up their voice to God with one accord.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.479
And said, and here's the recorded prayer, Lord, thou art God.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:50.960
Which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.600
That's a good way to start a prayer, is it not?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.160
I mean, just right away, get into the spirit of worship,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.320
understanding who he is, understanding who it is that we're praying to.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.320
Remember, when Jesus was giving that model prayer, it's not the Lord's prayer.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.559
It's the model prayer.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.759
When he said, when you pray, pray like this.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.559
Our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.679
He's holy. He's God.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.520
And we enter into his presence with a measure of reverence.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.720
And we find this worship and they come and they say, Lord, thou art God.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.360
And then they speak about the fact that he's creator God, which has made heaven

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.919
and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.600
David has said, why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.600
The kings of the earth stood up and the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.759
rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.399
against the holy thy holy child, Jesus, whom thou hast anointed.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.080
Both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.839
gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:18.359
before to be done in a great to see the sovereignty of God, says in verse 29.

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:27.279
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.679
boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.399
signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child, Jesus.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600
Notice the Bible says in verse 31.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:43.119
And when they had prayed,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.279
the place was shaken where they were assembled together.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.480
They were all filled with the Holy Ghost

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:52.720
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.440
As we look at the passage of Scripture and we see what's taking place.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.040
And I want you to just consider with me as we kind of go through the passage this

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.320
evening, if you're taking notes, number one, notice what prompted their prayer.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.799
What prompted their prayer?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.640
What led them to pray this prayer that's recorded for us in this passage of

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.760
Scripture? Well, again, we find contextually that in Acts chapter

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:19.839
number three, there was a great miracle that was performed.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.440
You'll recall with me that this miracle

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040
was when Peter and John were on the way to the temple.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.959
And as they're there, the Bible says that there was a man that was

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.440
begging at the gate, beautiful.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.559
And he was asking alms to all that were entering in.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.799
And the Bible tells us that this man was

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.040
above 40 years old to whom this miracle took place on.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.920
And the Bible says that Peter in verse

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:45.839
number four, fastening his eyes upon him with John said, look on us.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.519
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.239
And Peter said, silver and gold have I none.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.920
But such as I have give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.600
Rise up and walk.

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:04.799
And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.440
and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up, stood and walked and entered

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.799
with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.880
Can you imagine?

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.040
The Bible says in verse nine and all

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:24.000
the people saw him walking and praising God, and they knew it was him notice in

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.799
verse 10, and they knew that it was him by excuse me, that it was he which sat for

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.399
alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.040
amazement at that which had happened unto him.

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:37.480
You would be, too.

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:39.920
Amen. You knew this fellow was over here

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.559
begging and he was not able to walk.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.040
And now you see that he's up and he's leaping and he's praising God and he's

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:52.519
walking and you would be filled with amazement and wonder as well.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.359
We find that this notable miracle takes place in Acts chapter number three,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.880
and the Bible tells us that there were a great host of people that assembled

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:04.359
together, they were greatly wondering, they come to the porch that is called

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:08.959
Solomon's Porch, and we find that Peter sees this group of people gathered

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.640
together and he begins to preach.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.760
And I'm so thankful that the Bible records the the preaching of Peter,

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:19.839
of course, of others that are contained in the book of Acts, the messages

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.799
that they preach.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.239
But you see in the early portions of the book of Acts, several messages that Peter

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.279
preaches, and I love his boldness and his directness and how he stands up and just

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.760
gives the truth of the word of God.

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:35.559
And we find that he's preaching and you

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.880
find that the message is not well received by everyone.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:45.160
There are some, of course, that are noticing what's taking place and there

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.920
are some that are going to respond and just certainly have

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:54.359
wonder of all that's been said and all that they've seen.

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:55.320
And they're going to trust.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.160
The Bible tells us in verse number four

00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:01.399
of chapter number four, how be it many of them which heard the word believed.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.799
And the number of the men was about five thousand.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.480
That's a lot of people.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:08.839
We often speak about Pentecost where there were three thousand.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.200
Right.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:13.119
And then we find here in Acts chapter four that there are five thousand.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.720
And before long, you'll see that the numbers are not recorded with numeric

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.359
characters, but rather by saying a multitude and multitudes were saved.

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:27.440
And we find that this was a great opportunity.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.000
But there were religious leaders in this day that were not very excited about all

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.159
that was taking up taking place.

00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:37.960
And these religious leaders show up and the persecution begins.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.840
Notice I read verse four of chapter four where you see about the people that

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.320
believe, but notice in verse number one, it says, as they speak into the people,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.919
the priest and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them being

00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:56.520
grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:02.520
from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in hold until the next day.

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:07.080
We find that after they're there and they're being put in hold,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.039
that the rulers come in verse number five, that there are rulers, elders,

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:15.440
scribes, the anise, the high priest and Caiaphas and John Alexander.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.919
All of these folks come according to verse number six.

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:20.479
And they then set them in the midst.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.679
And they say this in verse number seven,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.760
by what power or by what name have you done this?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.239
And I'm so thankful that Peter did not stand up and say it's through our own power.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.440
See, Peter knew that it was not in himself.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.520
He knew that it was not his power.

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:40.280
He knew that it was not anything that that was in of himself,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.320
that it was through the power of the name of Jesus.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.080
And we find that Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.840
he says to them in verse number eight of chapter four,

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:57.479
ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.840
of the good deed done to the impotent man.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.520
by what means he has made whole, be it known unto you all,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.960
and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.120
whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.800
even by him doth this man stand here before you whole."

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.560
I mean, he's got boldness, amen? He's preaching.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.760
And he's standing before these religious leaders.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.840
He's standing before these that had the power to hold them in ward,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520
according to what we read already.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.560
In verse number three, they put them in ward until the next day,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.840
put them in hold, and we find that Peter is preaching,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.880
and we find that he uses that verse that we so often quote.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.240
In verse number 12,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.800
"'Neither is there salvation in any other,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360
for there's none other name under heaven given among men,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.720
whereby we must be saved.'"

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.520
I mean, he's confronting these religious leaders with their need for Christ.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.680
You know what's possible to be religious and be lost?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.480
Nicodemus was in that situation.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.200
He came to Jesus by night in John chapter number three,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.720
and he was religious, but Jesus said,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.320
"'Ye must be born again, ye must be born again.'"

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.000
And we find here that Peter has preached with boldness.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.240
Notice the observation of the religious leaders in verse 13.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.400
They saw the boldness of Peter and John

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.240
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.360
They marveled.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.960
Notice what it says.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.560
They took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.520
Man, that's a powerful statement.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.920
They had been with Jesus.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.440
You know, when we spend time with the Lord,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.120
it shows in our lives.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.840
It really does.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.360
These men, Peter and John,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.280
they had walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.800
They had been taught.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.360
During those three and a half or so years of earthly ministry,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.160
we find that Peter and John were in that inner circle,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.320
if you will, of the disciples.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.280
And they were there at the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.120
I mean, they got to see God work.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.240
They saw the miracles.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.720
They were eyewitnesses of these things.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.040
And we find here that these men, these religious leaders,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.240
they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.840
but then they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.600
Makes a huge difference.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:28.800
It says,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200
Beholding the man which was healed standing with them,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.640
they could say nothing against it.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.320
Now, see the scene.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.200
These religious leaders are beside themselves.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.440
They, look, we mentioned already that in verse number six,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.000
it says that Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.280
these other folks are all there.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.920
They're the same ones that put Jesus to death.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.560
That's why Peter says,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400
Whom ye crucified, but God raised from the dead.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.280
This was not long after the death,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.480
the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.200
We know that Acts 1 records His ascension,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.720
but not much time has passed.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.880
And we find here that He, Peter, is standing before them.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.760
And these religious leaders, they hate God.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.240
They hate all that's taking place.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.720
They put Jesus to death.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.800
And they want to silence Peter and John.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.080
But there's this guy standing there that was lame,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.960
that was now able to walk.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.080
And they were really in a situation

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.360
because they say in verse number 16,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.960
What shall we do to these men?

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.240
For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.480
by them is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.760
and we cannot deny it.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.800
I love it when God works.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.280
And He works in such a way that there's no possibility

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.960
that it can be explained by any natural causes,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.840
anything of our own power and our own strength

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.960
and our own might.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.440
No, we find that these religious leaders,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.200
they want to silence Peter and John.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.760
They want to silence the disciples

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.760
from going forth and preaching.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.560
But yet, they've acknowledged

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.280
that there's this notable miracle that's taking place,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.720
and they can't deny it.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.160
It's not like they could tell all of the people in Jerusalem

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.520
that this thing didn't really happen,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.920
because all the people in Jerusalem saw it.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.000
And they greatly wondered.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.000
And they heard Peter preach.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.920
The Bible tells us, as we begin to understand what led,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.800
remember, we're talking about what prompted their prayer.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.400
It's the miracle of chapter 3.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.480
It's the persecution of chapter 4.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.640
Notice it says in verse 17,

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.400
but that it spread no further among the people.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.080
So they didn't want to have anybody else

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.720
be influenced by the preaching of the Word of God.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.320
They didn't want more people being saved.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.120
And it says this,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.160
let us straightly threaten them

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.880
that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.560
And it tells us in verse number 18,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.200
that they called them and commanded them

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.160
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.480
Now, I can't imagine being told that.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.360
I hope, I pray that in my lifetime, in your lifetime,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.600
that we'd never be in this situation

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200
that these disciples are in.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.640
The Bible says that Peter and John answered in verse 19

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.440
and said unto them,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.040
whether it be right in the sight of God

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.280
to hearken unto you more than unto God,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.480
judge ye.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.360
4, verse 20,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.400
we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.880
You'll know that in chapter 5,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.120
when they're facing more persecution

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.800
and they're dealing with all of those things,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.360
they say in verse 28 of chapter 5,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.720
those same religious leaders,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.720
they said, did not we straightly command you

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.880
that you should not teach in this name?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.600
And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.640
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.000
Isn't that a great testimony?

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.480
Hey, you don't speak in his name.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.680
And then you say, you filled Jerusalem with his doctrine.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.640
Praise the Lord.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.920
But Peter in that verse and the others that were with him

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.120
answered and said, we ought to obey God rather than men.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.120
Here in chapter 4,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.880
he says, we cannot but speak the things

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.080
which we have seen and heard.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.440
So when they had further threatened them,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.400
they let them go,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.160
finding nothing how they might punish them

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.360
because of the people.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.080
For all men glorified God for that which was done.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.680
For the man was about 40 years old

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.600
on whom this miracle of healing was showed.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.080
Then we get to verse number 23,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.320
the prayer that we're dealing with this evening,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.680
a prayer for boldness.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.480
And being let go, they went to their own company.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.160
They come back, they begin to report.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.360
Notice verse 24.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.600
And when they heard that, what did they hear?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.200
Well, it says in verse number 23,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.920
and reported all that the chief priest

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.640
and elders had said unto them.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.040
They go back to their company

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.160
and they say, here's what they said.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.960
They said that we can't speak any longer

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.000
in the name of Jesus.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.480
We can't teach or preach in his name.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080
This was the report that was brought back.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.800
And so we see what prompted their prayer

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.960
was all that backdrop

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.080
that we've just looked through

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.000
and we see the persecution.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.480
And we notice that the Bible says

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.600
in verse number 13,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.640
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.680
I've already made note

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.720
that when Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.920
in verse number eight

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.400
and down through verse number 12,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.160
when he gives them an answer

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.640
that they've requested,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.920
they ask a question,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.520
he provides an answer.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.920
He's speaking with boldness.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.440
We find that they go to God in prayer.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.280
We see what prompted their prayer.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.120
I noticed as I study the prayer

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.720
that is given to us here,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.000
I noticed that the prayer

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.680
reveals some things to us.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.560
I believe that it reveals to us

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.440
that they are depending upon the Lord.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.800
There's no self-dependence.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.320
There's God dependence.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.000
The reality is that we need God.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.320
We need Him.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.040
Every moment of every day,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.320
we need God.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.400
He said in John 15,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.920
without Me, ye can do nothing.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.760
That's Bible.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.000
And we find here

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.800
that these immediately respond in prayer.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.000
They immediately lift up their voice to God

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.440
with one accord.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.200
They are revealing to me

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.040
as I look at the passage of Scripture

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.440
that they are depending upon God.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.200
They did not immediately set a date

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.160
for a conference

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.559
where they would sit around a round table

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.480
and figure out what they were going to do

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.760
and how they were going to scheme

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.200
and what plan they were going to devise.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.800
No, they go to God in prayer.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.640
They seek the face of God.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.960
I believe that prayer is

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.000
one of the greatest expressions

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.920
of our dependence upon the Lord.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.640
When we pray as we ought,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.120
we're revealing that we're depending upon Him.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.120
We notice,

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:29.920
as I mentioned by way of introduction in verse 24,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.680
that this prayer reveals to us

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.680
that they had an understanding of who God is.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.280
I think this is important for us to understand.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.080
See, our view of God

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.600
is of significant importance.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.400
There are some that have a wrong view of God.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.600
They do not understand the God of the Bible.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.480
They don't understand what He's capable of doing.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.559
The Bible tells us in Isaiah chapter 6

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.680
that Isaiah saw Him, God, high and lifted.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.740
lifted up, that His train filled the temple,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.100
He saw Him in all of His holiness.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.000
We begin to consider the view that we have of God

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.740
and when we have a proper view of God,

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.100
when we understand who He is,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.560
it causes us to have greater faith

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.420
and greater dependence upon Him.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.760
See, these individuals, these disciples

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.840
in the early church,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.020
they understood that He was the Creator God.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.680
He spoke it all into existence.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.240
Now certainly if He could say,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.340
let there be light and there was light,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.940
certainly if He could create everything out of nothing,

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.380
He could deal with these religious leaders.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.360
Amen?

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.040
This was nothing for God.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.640
Oh, it's beyond their ability.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.740
It's beyond their ability to do something,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.540
to change the hearts of these individuals,

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.500
but we find that they understand who God is.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.420
I'm mindful of a verse that we've often referenced

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.820
from Psalm 121.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.740
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.500
from whence cometh my help.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.980
My help cometh from the Lord

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.940
which made heaven and earth.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.700
What a powerful truth.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.500
I'm mindful of what the psalmist says

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.700
and we can read in Genesis 1

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.620
and you read repeatedly how the Bible says

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.220
that God said and it was so.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.500
And we find that in Psalm 34,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.340
the Bible says,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.940
by the word of the Lord in verse 6,

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.180
where the heavens made and all the host of them

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.940
by the breath of His mouth,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.740
for He spake, verse number 9,

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.860
and it was done, He commanded,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.900
and it stood fast.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.980
That's our God.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.340
In Psalm 48, the psalmist is lifting up the Lord.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.860
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.540
And he's speaking about the greatness of God

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.700
and as he goes through that psalm,

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.860
and again, I made reference to this last week,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.020
but we see that he's lifting up God

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.300
and speaking about the greatness

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.300
and he says at the end of the passage,

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.060
for this God is our God forever and ever.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:07.140
He will be our guide even unto death.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.260
Our God is great.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.100
Our God is all powerful.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.780
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.740
He revealed Himself to Abraham

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.420
as being El Shaddai,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.620
the Lord God Almighty.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.380
And just after He reveals Himself to Abraham

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.820
as being El Shaddai,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.180
He then asks Abraham,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.500
is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.820
See, God has revealed Himself to us in His Word.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.420
I want you to think about the disciples.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.580
I want you to think about what they had experienced

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.700
in their life and their understanding

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.420
of who God is

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.100
and their understanding of the power of God.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.660
Think about Peter and John.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.020
I mean, it was Peter and John

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.980
that saw great miracles.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.940
It was Peter and John that participated

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.260
in the feeding of the 5,000,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.940
the feeding of the 4,000.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.380
It was Peter that,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.580
John of course as well,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.460
saw the Lord walking on the water,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.780
but it was Peter that got out of the boat, remember?

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.420
And he walks on the water.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.900
He said, Lord, if it be Thee, bid me come to Thee.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.220
And Peter got out of the boat

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.980
and he began to walk on the water.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.180
You say, but he didn't make it far.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.300
He made it further than me

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.100
and further than you.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.180
No one else got out of the boat.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.140
Amen.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.820
Peter had seen the Lord do some amazing things.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.860
You know, in John 21,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.220
the Bible tells us that Peter says,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.020
I go a-fishing.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.260
We can criticize Peter all day if we want.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.340
But I'll tell you, I think we can relate to Peter.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.500
Peter said, I go a-fishing.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.900
They go fishing

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.540
and Jesus is there on the shore

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.580
and He says,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.420
children,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.180
did you catch anything?

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.420
And they said, no.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.980
He said, cast your net on the right side.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.380
And they did.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.220
Man, they got a great host of fish.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.940
I think it was probably the largest catch

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.260
of their time of being fishermen

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.380
for the Bible gives us the exact count

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.220
of how many fish it were.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.500
But you find that they say,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.260
no, we have nothing.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.660
And they cast and the Bible says

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.420
that they were not able to draw

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.980
for the multitude of fishes.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.180
And then it was John,

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.300
the disciple whom the Lord loved,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.740
and this is how John referred to him.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740
And he said to Peter,

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.460
Peter, it is the Lord.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.460
And what does Peter do?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.460
He jumps out of the boat

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.260
and he swims to the shore.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.220
See, these guys had seen the Lord work.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.060
They knew what He was capable of doing.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.740
Their prayer reveals to us

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.020
their dependence.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.180
Their prayer reveals to us

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.180
that they had an understanding

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180
of who God is.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.340
Their prayer reveals to us,

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.340
I believe, their own inability.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.940
Notice in verse 29, it says,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.060
Now, Lord, behold their threatenings

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.780
and grant unto Thy servants

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.380
that with all boldness

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.460
they may speak Thy Word.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.060
They knew they had an understanding

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.340
that it was not within themselves.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.260
They needed God to give them boldness.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.940
I believe that they had an understanding

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.700
of the plan of God.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.820
See you notice that here in verse 29,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.420
the verse that I just read,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.420
that their singular prayer request

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.740
was that God would give them boldness.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.220
Grant unto Thy servants

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.140
that with all boldness

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.660
they may speak Thy Word.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.500
Perhaps, if I were in the situation,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.100
I would have prayed for deliverance.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.060
And maybe you would have too.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.980
Maybe you would have prayed

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.220
some type of prayer

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.220
with regard to these religious leaders

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.420
and that God would deal with them.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.580
We find that they just simply

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.540
pray for boldness.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.860
God, give us boldness to speak Thy Word.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.500
See, it's interesting because

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.020
Jesus had warned them,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.340
had given them the truth

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.940
that they would face opposition.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.860
That they would encounter

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.340
those that would hate them

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.860
and oppose them

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.540
during their earthly ministry.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.380
If you hold your place there in Acts 4,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.020
I want you to see in John 15,

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.860
we mentioned earlier about the truth

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.780
in the beginning of the passage of Scripture.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.220
Without Me, you can do nothing.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.860
But we find that as Jesus continues

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.500
to give instruction to His disciples

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.740
before He would go to the cross of Calvary,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.060
that He says to them in verse 18 of John 15,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.580
if the world hates you,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.980
you know that it hated Me

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.900
before it hated you.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.980
If you were of the world,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.820
the world would love His own.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.340
Because you're not of the world,

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.260
but I have chosen you out of the world,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.540
therefore the world hateth you.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.060
Remember the word that I said unto you,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.140
the servant is not greater than his Lord.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.300
If they have persecuted Me,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.700
they will also persecute you.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.860
If they have kept My saying,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.820
they will keep yours also.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.860
Notice if you skip over to verse 1 of chapter 16,

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.300
these things have I spoken unto you

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.420
that you should not be offended.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.060
They shall put you out of the synagogues, yea?

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.660
The time cometh that whosoever killeth you

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.780
will think that he doeth God's service.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.620
And these things will they do unto you

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.780
because they have not known the Father nor Me.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.140
But these things have I told you

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.660
that when the time shall come,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.340
you may remember that I told you of them.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.220
These things I said not unto you

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.860
at the beginning because I was with you.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.860
He tells them He's going to go away,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.500
but of course He tells them that He was going to send

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.340
the Comforter, the Holy Spirit of God.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.860
We go back to Acts chapter 4,

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.860
and we notice that as we examine their prayer

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.820
that it reveals to us their dependence.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.500
It reveals their understanding of who God is.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.300
It reveals that they had an understanding,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.220
an awareness of their own inability

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.460
and an understanding of what God's plan is.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.740
God's plan is that His Word would go forth

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.260
unto all the world.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.100
It's His plan.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.380
And we are His witnesses.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.860
Remember, that's what the disciples said.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.060
That's what Peter and John said there in chapter 4

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.460
as we've read already in verse 20.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.340
For we cannot but speak the things

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.980
which we have seen and heard.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.420
So we find that they pray for boldness.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.740
We've noticed as we've looked at this passage

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.500
what prompted their prayer.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.540
We've noticed what their prayer reveals.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.020
And now I want you to see how their prayer is answered.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.060
I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.820
it's such a joy to know that our God hears

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.100
and answers prayer.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.980
The Lord said to Solomon,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.820
I have heard thy prayer.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.340
2 Chronicles chapter number 7.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.620
We've referenced that truth throughout the Scriptures

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.900
many times in which you see that God

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.460
would just reassure His people

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.620
of the fact that He hears us.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.940
He hears us when we pray.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.380
And as we look here and we notice

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.900
how this prayer is answered,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.420
the Bible says in verse number 31,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.780
and when they had prayed,

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.460
the place was shaken where they were assembled together.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.500
They were all filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.420
And notice the last phrase of verse number 31,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.700
when they spake the Word of God, how?

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.100
With boldness.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.260
What did they pray for?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.580
Lord, grant unto thy servants

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.620
that with all boldness

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.060
they may speak thy Word.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.220
I'll tell you this evening,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.140
what's prompted the message tonight

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.300
is a conversation I had with a ministry friend this week.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.140
And as we were just speaking and chatting

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.980
about various things that are going on

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.860
in our world today and our society

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.500
and all that's taking place even here in America,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.460
the comment was made,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.940
we need boldness.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.860
And immediately the thought

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.940
between me and this evangelist,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.660
Brother Hummel is who it was,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.220
immediately went to Acts 4.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.940
Thinking about the situation

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.740
in which these disciples face,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.540
I don't think it's the same situation

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.180
that we face today.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.020
Though I...

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:05.740
I think it could be at some point in our lives.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.340
We notice how these disciples,

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.060
they pray for boldness.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.600
And I wonder, how often do I pray for boldness?

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.000
How often do we pray for boldness?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.220
The reality is that no one's even made a threat

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.500
to me or to you probably.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.320
No one's beaten us as we see

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.960
at the end of Acts 5

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.360
where they get beaten because of their

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.900
speaking the name of the Lord and preaching.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.580
The Bible tells us in Acts 5,

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.500
then verse number 40 that to him they agreed.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.020
That was to Gamaliel as he gave some information

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.860
with regard to what they would do.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.340
And he says that they had called the apostles

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.540
and beaten them.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.260
They commanded that they should not speak

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.620
in the name of Jesus and let them go.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.220
The Bible tells us in verse 41,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.900
they departed from the presence of the council

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.580
rejoicing that they were accounted worthy

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.500
to suffer shame for his name

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.760
and daily in the temple and every house

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.720
they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.880
Now if you follow verse 40 through 42,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.760
you find that they were beaten

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.020
and then they were commanded not to speak.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.220
They leave and they rejoice that they were beaten,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.540
that they were accounted worthy

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.760
to suffer shame for his name's sake.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.000
And then they daily in the temple

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.440
and in every house, what do they do?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.100
They cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.320
They had boldness.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.760
They're filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.800
We see that in Acts 4 in verse number 8,

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.040
then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost, right?

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.440
And then they perceived,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.120
they saw the boldness of Peter in verse 13.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.440
We find in verse 29, they pray for boldness

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.400
and in verse number 31, the Bible says

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.240
that the place was shaken where they were assembled

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.360
and they were filled with the Holy Ghost

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.200
and they spake with the Word of God

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.300
or they spake the Word of God with boldness.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.720
The Bible teaches that at the moment of salvation,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.360
we are indwelled by the Spirit of God.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.920
I'm very thankful for that teaching.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.040
I dealt with it a little bit this morning in our message

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.440
and as we understand the truth

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.440
that we are indwelled by the Spirit of God

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.660
at the moment of salvation,

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.480
the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit of God

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.040
is the earnest of our salvation.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.000
Remember, it was Paul that said

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.740
that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.680
which we have of God, which of course,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.500
we understand there in 1 Corinthians 6,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.100
the truth of what he's teaching with regard to surrender,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.080
but we find that we're not always filled

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.020
with the Spirit of God.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.060
We can be indwelled by the Spirit of God,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.700
but not filled with the Spirit of God.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.200
The indwelling of the Spirit of God,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.560
really, if I could use this terminology,

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.620
would refer to how much of the Holy Spirit I have.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.260
I have all the Holy Spirit I'm ever gonna have.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.540
I was indwelled with the Spirit of God

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.300
at the moment of salvation.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.840
But the filling of the Spirit of God

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.280
is how much of me does he have, right?

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.420
How much of me controls me

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.480
versus how much is filled with the Holy Spirit of God?

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.900
I've used the illustration before

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.220
that if I had a bottle of water,

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.800
and I have a bottle of water here,

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.880
and I have one that's completely full,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.960
so I won't use that, but I have this one,

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.680
and that's not quite halfway full,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.880
but it's close, probably 40%.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.560
And if I wanna put some other drink in here,

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.120
I wanna put sweet tea in here,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.460
because I like sweet tea,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.480
I would want to empty this 40% of water

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.280
before I put the sweet tea in here.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.440
I don't like my juice watered down.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.720
I remember when the kids were little, right?

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.760
You water their juice down, you put half and half,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.040
and man, that's disgusting.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.420
I want the full, just give me the full thing, right?

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.280
I mean, give me all of it.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.720
And so if I put sweet tea in here,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.200
it's gonna water it down.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.000
But in order for me to fill this with sweet tea,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.640
I need to first empty the water.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.400
If I'm gonna be filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.180
I must be emptied of self.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.260
And we find that here in the passage of Scripture,

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.660
the Bible says that they were filled with the Holy Ghost,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.620
and then they spake the word with boldness.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.940
Remember, it's in Ephesians 5, in verse 18,

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.780
where the Bible says,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.460
and be not drunk with wine, wherein his excess,

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.560
but be filled with the Spirit.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.580
And it's a command that we are given

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.540
to be filled with the Spirit.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.860
He gives us what the evidence of that filling is,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.780
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.660
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.880
in your heart to the Lord,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.600
giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.000
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.280
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.860
A prayer for boldness.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.820
We read in Acts 4,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.660
this powerful prayer of the early church.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.980
They were facing some difficulties.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.640
In no way am I saying, suggesting to you this evening

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.380
that what we face is in like manner of what they face.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.540
We face our own difficulties, our own challenges,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.340
our own obstacles, our own oppositions,

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.100
our own adversities.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.220
They exist.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.820
But I wonder if we're praying for boldness.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.220
It's easy for us to complain about the circumstances.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.660
It's easy for us to devise a plan.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.840
But oh, how we need to pray that God would work,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.980
that God would give us boldness,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.680
that God would fill us with His Spirit,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.280
that we'd be emptied of self.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.720
We notice this prayer was answered.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.840
See, God delights in answering prayer.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840
He really does.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.400
When we pray according to His will,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.360
it was God's will that they speak the word

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.280
and that they speak it with boldness.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.780
And they were praying in accord to the will of God.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.660
And God answered.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.780
This evening, I wanna challenge you,

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.300
challenge myself to pray for boldness.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.260
That we would look at this passage of Scripture

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.740
and we see all of the historical setting

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.740
and we understand at a certain level

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.520
all that was taking place and these things

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.520
during the early church and this first century situation.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.540
But oh, that God would help us in 2020

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.400
to pray a similar prayer.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:27.180
God, Lord, You are God.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.060
You're the creator.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.660
You're in control of everything.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.880
You're the redeemer, You're sovereign.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.740
Lord, we need Your boldness.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.520
We pray that You would grant us boldness,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.100
that we would speak Your word

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.680
and how we would let the Lord have His way in our lives.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.400
Father, we love You.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.200
And we thank You so much for loving us.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.400
We thank You for Your word

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.120
and the truth that's contained therein.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.520
We thank You for the examples

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.040
of those that have gone before us.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.640
We thank You for Peter and John

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.880
in this portion of Scripture.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
We thank You for how they immediately respond

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.720
by seeking Your face in prayer.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.720
What a pattern for us to follow,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.020
how we're challenged by their behavior.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.240
Lord, I pray You'd help us to have a proper view

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.200
of who You are, that we'd have that understanding

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.960
that You are God, the Lord God omnipotent,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.840
that You reign, that You are King of kings,

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.580
Lord of lords, the great I am.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.520
And God, we pray You'd fill us with Your power,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.680
fill us with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.280
In Acts 1 and verse number eight,

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.360
but You shall receive power

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.040
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon You.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.120
You shall be witnesses unto me,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.680
both in Jerusalem and Judea, Samaria,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.480
the uttermost part of the earth.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.440
Oh God, I pray that You'd give us that power,

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.760
the filling of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.840
Help us to be emptied of self

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.460
and help us, Lord, to speak Thy word with boldness.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.820
We pray that You'd have Your will and way

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.980
in each of our lives and we'll thank You for what You'll do

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.780
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
