00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a joy to have these great hymns of the faith that remind us of great Bible truth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.279
And I hope that your heart and your mind has stayed upon Jehovah and you find that He is

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:17.000
able to do for you what no other could ever do for you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.959
And of course, as we would mention often as we think about the great songs of the faith

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:28.959
and the opportunity that we have to sing these great hymns and to be encouraged by them,

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:32.479
that we have the privilege of knowing the Lord.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:39.880
I mentioned to somebody not long ago how encouraging it is that we have the opportunity to have

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.439
the Word of God.

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:47.000
You know, we'd be in the same amount of confusion and chaos that the rest of the world seems

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.959
to be in apart from having the Word of God.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:55.680
And I'm so thankful that God has chosen to give us His precious book, the Bible.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.919
It's interesting as we sang that song and you think about the truth in Isaiah 26, it's

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:03.439
not part of the message this morning, we'll get to Colossians in just a moment, but the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.879
Bible says in verse number 3 of Isaiah 26,

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:14.959
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee, because he trusteth

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:15.959
in Thee.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.239
Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:31.360
What a wonderful truth from the Word of God, Isaiah 26, verses 3 and 4.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.260
This morning we'll be in the book of Colossians.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.519
If you have your Bible with you there, turn to the book of Colossians if you will.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.199
Colossians chapter number 1, we'll be looking at verses 9 through 14.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:45.400
I will acknowledge to you this at the very onset of the message that verses 13 and 14

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360
are kind of transitional verses, I'll deal with them in the text of Scripture this morning,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.239
and most likely we'll deal with them again next week as we get into the next section

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.500
of Colossians chapter number 1.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.080
But I'm so thankful for this book and I'm thankful that we have the opportunity to study

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.000
this book together here in 2021.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.199
This is our fourth message through the book of Colossians.

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:10.399
And you'll recall with me, I hope at least, that last week we focused upon the last four

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.440
words of verse number 3.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.759
Verses 1-3, if you note those last four words, the Apostle Paul said,

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.360
"...praying always for you."

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.000
What a great statement that is.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.600
What great encouragement the believers at Colossae must have received as they read those

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.800
words.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.800
And we find that as we took note of the example of intercessory prayer, not only here in the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.039
book of Colossians, but really throughout the New Testament.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:43.000
We looked at a number of passages of Scripture last week and understood the importance of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.339
intercessory prayer and how that the Apostle Paul was regularly communicating to those

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.919
that God would give him the opportunity to minister to, and he was communicating to them,

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.639
I'm praying for you.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.919
And not only does he say he's praying for them, but we find, as we'll study this morning

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:04.679
in verses 9-14, often he communicates how he is praying for them.

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:09.199
Not only does Paul offer to those that he's ministered to the way in which he's praying

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:14.000
for them, but on a number of occasions we find that Paul himself is requesting that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.039
the brethren would pray for him.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:22.000
Thus we see in the New Testament the example of intercessory prayer.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.639
We went through and looked at that, and we confirmed all that we understood about this

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.279
subject matter of intercessory prayer, and then we said this, that we need to purpose

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.800
in our lives to engage in intercessory prayer.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.520
And as we begin to look at the challenge and we make that purpose, I hope that in the last

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.039
week from the message last Sunday morning that we've put these things into practice

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:53.360
in our lives, that we have understood the importance of intercessory prayer, that we

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.000
are going before the throne room of heaven before God Almighty on the behalf of our brothers

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.919
and sisters in Christ.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.539
What a great privilege.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:13.440
I said this near the end of the message last week, that intercessory prayer requires information

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.160
and commitment.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.760
I made the statement a number of times over the years that prayer is work.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.119
Prayer is hard work.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:25.959
The devil doesn't want you to pray, the enemy doesn't want you to pray, but we understand

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:28.040
that God has called us to pray.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.079
You know, it's interesting.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.279
It's the only thing within the Word of God that God says to do without ceasing.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.440
Pray without ceasing.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.920
You see the significance and the importance that God has placed upon prayer, to be in

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.299
that spirit of prayer regularly in our lives, and as we would look at this prayer that the

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:55.799
Apostle Paul would make on the behalf of these believers in Colossae, we take note that he

00:04:55.799 --> 00:05:00.239
had some information and he was committed.

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.839
By way of introduction, we understand that Paul knew some things.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.640
Number one, the Apostle Paul knew that they were saved.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.760
Remember, in verse number two, he said, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.920
Jesus, which are at Colossae.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.079
So he's writing to believers, the book of Colossians is a book that was written to people

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.079
that were saved.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:25.519
Thus, he does not pray for their salvation, they're already saved.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.559
He understood they were saved.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.679
He understood, look in verse five and six, as we continue to see how that he had this

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:36.559
information, this knowledge, he says, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:41.440
whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.799
as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, notice, as it doth also in you, since

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:53.359
the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth.

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:59.679
We find also in verses 13 and 14, and we'll get into those verses as we study the passage

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:05.359
this morning, but we see that he speaks about redemption in those verses of Scripture.

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:09.880
And so we understand that Paul had some information about these that he's ministering to, that

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.239
he's seeking to encourage through this letter.

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.660
Number one, he knew that they were saved.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.079
Number two, he knew that they were instructed.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:21.279
In verse number seven, remember, as he made comment about Epaphras, he says this in verse

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:28.000
number seven, as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who was for you a

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.720
faithful minister of Christ.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.799
Several weeks ago, as we looked at that passage of Scripture, we dealt with the fact that

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:41.519
these believers in Colossae, they had been discipled, they had been instructed, they

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.480
had been taught, and we also understood that there's some truth in the word of God that

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.880
would help us to be able to understand what makes a minister a faithful minister of Christ.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.839
And as we examined those portions of Scripture, we concluded with confidence that this was

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:04.579
a church in which they were receiving instruction from the word of God.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:07.160
But we also understand that Paul knew something else.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.200
There's a third thing that the apostle Paul knew, and he knew that there were false teachers

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.480
that were active.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.760
He knew that there were some false teachers that were active.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.000
We'll get into it as we study the remainder of the book of Colossians here in this calendar

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
year.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.079
But let me just make note of Colossians 2, in verse number eight, this morning, by way

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:28.119
of introduction, we find that the Bible says this, beware.

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:34.640
Now, any time you see a beware or a warning, I warn you in the word of God, we ought to

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.959
take note to that, and we ought to kind of perk up our ears.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.239
I mean, we ought to be attentive and take note of all of the Scripture, because all

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:47.079
Scripture is profitable, but when a warning is being issued, we ought to pay closest attention

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:48.079
to that.

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:54.679
Notice what he says to these believers, beware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy

00:07:54.679 --> 00:08:02.899
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.959
after Christ.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.799
There's some specific things that are dealt with in the book of Colossians with regard

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:14.760
to false teachers, but we understand that Paul, as he is seeking to minister to these

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.160
believers in Colossae, he knew some things.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.320
And remember, if I'm going to engage in intercessory prayer, I need to have a certain amount of

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.459
information.

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.040
What information did Paul have?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.600
They were saved, they were taught, they were discipled, and there were false teachers that

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.880
were active.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.159
And it will be interesting, as we study the prayer of Paul, that we will see how the information

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.520
that he had influenced the way in which he prayed.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.359
I mentioned not only does it require information, but it also requires a commitment.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:51.080
How do we know that Paul was committed to this ministry of intercessory prayer?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.000
Well, remember the title for last week's lesson, Praying Always for You.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.840
We see that at the end of verse number three in Colossians 1, and Paul is revealing to

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.039
the believers in Colossae that he is committed to this ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.679
He says, praying always for you.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:11.679
Not only that, but I want you to take note in verse number nine, the Bible says, for

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:19.559
this cause we also, since the day we heard it, notice these words, do not cease to pray

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.559
for you.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:24.159
You think Paul was committed to the ministry of intercessory prayer?

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.159
Absolutely.

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:31.460
I mean, as we took the opportunity last week to survey through a number of scriptures and

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.739
to deal with the example of intercessory prayer, we found how that he would make the

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:41.619
statement of, I give thanks without ceasing, I'm praying for you, and the way in which

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:47.400
he used the always, I'm praying for you always, and he talked to Timothy, and he said to Timothy

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.059
that I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.659
And here, as he's writing to these believers, he says, I'm praying always for you, and then

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:59.900
he says, I do not cease to pray for you.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.900
He does not cease to pray.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.900
He does not cease to pray.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:01.900


00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.460
take note in verse number nine that the word we is used obviously as you look at

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.620
verse number one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.380
Timotheus our brother and so Paul and Timothy obviously Timothy was his son in

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.980
the faith and he's mentioning as he's writing this book about the prayers not

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.780
only that he is praying for them but also Timothy as he would use that word

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.100
we now as we look at this passage of scripture if you're taking notes I'd

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.420
give you this title this morning very simply Paul's prayer for the Colossians

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.740
Paul's prayer for the Colossians we'll look at Colossians 1 verses 9 through

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:47.980
14 and I would say this as we evaluate this passage of scripture as we kind of

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:54.380
dig in and look at the the the nuts and bolts if you will of the the prayer of

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.820
Paul for these believers in Colossae I hope that we would be encouraged and

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:06.140
strengthened but I also hope that we would evaluate our own prayer life in

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.020
light of the example in scripture as we look here in Colossians 1 even as you

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.380
look over the book of Ephesians in chapter 1 and chapter 3 as you look at

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.580
the prayers that Paul made mention to the believers in Ephesus and how he was

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.900
praying for them you will understand some very important aspects of prayer

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:33.300
and how our prayer lives should be modeled now as you look at the passage

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.780
of scripture we'll dig in number one if you're taking notes consider how Paul

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.740
prayed number one consider how Paul prayed in verses 9 through 11 we'll have

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.820
the privilege of being able to see how Paul prayed for these believers notice

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.620
in verse number 9 the Bible says this for this cause we also since the day we

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.860
heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:00.260
with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.340
you might walk worthy of the Lord and all-pleasing being fruitful in every

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.700
good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.540
might according to his glorious power and all patience and long-suffering with

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.500
joyfulness we'll get into the remainder of the passage here in just a moment but

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.580
as we really consider how Paul prayed immediately upon reading verse 9 10 in

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.940
the first half of verse number 11 you will immediately note that spiritual

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.940
growth was the main aspect and emphasis of the prayer of the Apostle Paul we

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.460
would understand that Paul is praying about the spiritual need of these

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:47.100
believers in Colossae oftentimes as we would seek to evaluate our own prayers

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.460
on the behalf of others we could ask ourselves this question are our prayers

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.340
is our prayer life mostly physical request or is it mostly spiritual

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.700
request that maybe we could say it this way are we praying more about the

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.900
temporal things or the spiritual things the reality is that we understand that

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:15.740
God has instructed us to pray about physical things in fact in James chapter

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:22.700
5 God very clearly said if any are sick let him pray and so I would never

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.780
suggest that it would be inappropriate for us to pray for physical needs we

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:34.260
ought to it is in obedience that we pray to God with regard to physical needs but

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:40.420
the reality is that we can't miss out on praying about the spiritual aspect do

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.420
you know that there are times in life when somebody may be dealing with a

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:50.220
physical situation they may be dealing with a period of adversity a time of

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.980
affliction if you will and they're in this manifold temptation this heaviness

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.060
this trial if you will and they're going through that and we could pray that it

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.500
would be removed we can pray that they'd be delivered but you know we all also be

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:09.300
praying that they would be developed spiritually through that no doubt in my

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:17.100
in my mind that God desires to teach us lessons and to grow us spiritually

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.380
through those things that we encounter in life as we begin to pray one for

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.500
another and we're praying for someone with regard to a physical need oh that

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.420
God would help us to not miss out on the opportunity to also pray about the

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.420
spiritual aspect of this God would you help them to learn that your grace is

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.340
sufficient would you help them to grow in grace and knowledge would you help

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.300
them to learn something about you in the midst of this storm in this trial that

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:53.060
they're currently going through that they would not learn any other way I've

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.060
often said throughout the years that there are some things that we can only

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:04.580
learn about God in the storms it's just the way it is God has a purpose in those

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:10.660
storms by the way we understand that biblically and it needs to shape our

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.260
prayer life that we pray not only about the physical but also about the

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.460
spiritual and we see immediately here in the text of Scripture that Paul's

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.860
emphasis in the main thrust or aspect of this prayer is one of spiritual growth I

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:30.100
would ask myself this question why is that why is it the case that the

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.900
Apostle Paul is is praying about this spiritual growth of these believers

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.380
will remember as we mentioned by way of introduction there were some things that

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.140
Paul knew some things that he understood he understood that they were they were

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.300
saved people and so guess what we need to pray for our brothers and sisters in

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.500
Christ that we would grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.340
Christ we understand that it's important that we would pray for the spiritual

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.860
growth of of those within our church and that you as a parent of children

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.220
that are saved that you would pray for their spiritual growth that that they

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:08.300
would grow spiritually certainly were desirous to see our children grow

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.900
physically and emotionally and intellectually but all that we would not

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:19.300
fail to pray about their spiritual growth they would grow spiritually so he

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.260
knew they were saved but he also knew that there were some false teachers you

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:30.740
know what the best way is for us to combat false teaching is by knowing the

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.460
truth you know the people that are most vulnerable to the false teachers are the

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.620
ones that are immature spiritually and let me say this maturity spiritually is

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.900
not based upon our age it's not even based upon the number of years that

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.420
we've been saved remember as Paul was writing to the believers in Corinth he

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.340
said that he could not write to them as being spiritual but he had to write it

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.220
to them as being carnal they were babes in Christ he says this you don't need to

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.380
turn there but in 1st Corinthians chapter 3 in verse number 1 he says and

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.620
I brethren could not speak and do as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:16.100
as unto babes in Christ now Paul had ministered in Corinth for an extensive

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.260
period of time those people had been trained and taught and discipled yet

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.660
they were carnal and Paul says I have to feed you with milk and not with meat for

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:33.300
hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able see we need

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.700
to pray for the spiritual growth the spiritual maturity of one another

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.740
because the false teachers are active today just as they were in the time in

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.180
which Paul was writing to the believers in Colossae we understand that as you

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.620
study the Word of God that God has given us the truth throughout the New

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.100
Testament about the false teachers that would be prevalent in fact Jude says

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.660
that they creep in they have crept in unawares is what it says in the book of

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.100
Jude we understand that Peter says this as he's ministering to those and

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.900
teaching them and admonishing them and encouraging them with regard to being

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:15.460
settled and being just mature in Christ he says there are false teachers just as

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.420
there were false prophets and so those believers could look back to the Old

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.380
Testament they could see the presence of false prophets throughout the Old

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.420
Testament you can do the same thing and you can read throughout the historical

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.780
books and the prophetical books of the Old Testament you can see the false

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.100
prophets that were active and Peter says in like manner there will be false

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:47.660
teachers there amongst us they they seek to to deceive I've often said that

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.660
they'll use our vocabulary but not our dictionary and how is it that we are

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:59.020
able to combat false teaching we must be settled and grounded in the Word of God

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.180
we must know with confidence with assurance what thus sayeth the Lord what

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:11.900
does God's Word say well this guy on YouTube has 2.5 million followers and

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:19.100
he's saying this and he's saying that and he's teaching this beware beware you

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.940
understand the right way isn't always the popular way amen the reality is that

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.500
we need to know what God says and I don't care how many followers somebody

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.780
has on some social media platform if they're not teaching what God's Word

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.220
says then they're not teaching what we ought to be allowing to enter into our

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.220
ears we need to know the Word of God so Paul says I'm praying for their

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:51.780
spiritual growth remember what we know and what Paul knew impacted how he

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.820
prayed that's why I mentioned last week about the importance of having

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.900
information if we're going to be engaged in intercessory prayer now let's look at

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.860
what he prays number one

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.780
He prays this, that they would know the will of God.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.980
Notice in v. 9, He says,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.300
for this cause we also since the day we heard it

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.620
do not cease to pray for you and to desire,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.260
notice this, that you might be filled

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.620
with the knowledge of His will

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.620
in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.960
Oh, what a blessing to know that the Apostle Paul

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.800
is praying for these believers in Colossae

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.480
and he's saying, I am praying

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.540
that you would know the will of God.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.440
Remember, His will, the will of God,

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.380
is revealed in His word.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.840
It is important, I know it's often been said

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.840
throughout the ages, that His will, the will of God,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.800
will never contradict His word.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.040
His will will never contradict His word.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.120
Someone comes to me and says,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.440
I believe it's God's will that I fill in the blank.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.040
And I say, well, I'm pretty confident

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040
that's not the will of God

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.520
because here's what God's word says.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.480
You understand what I'm saying?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.760
And so God's will will never contradict His word.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.920
And so how is it that we now having

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.560
the whole canon of Scripture,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.000
how is it that we begin to understand the will of God?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.560
Well, we better get into the word of God.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.160
And as we get into the word of God,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.720
God reveals, if you will,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.280
His general will for all believers.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.280
His general will for all people

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.920
is that none would perish,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.360
but that all would come to repentance.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.520
We understand that there in 2 Peter 3,

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.440
in verse number nine,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.800
the Lord is not slack concerning His promises.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.880
Some men count slackness,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.960
but as longsuffering to us,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.280
we're not willing that any should perish,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.080
but that all should come to repentance.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.960
We understand that God's will for mankind

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.840
is that they would be saved.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.680
We understand not only in 2 Peter 3,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.520
in verse number nine,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.120
but in 1 Timothy 2, in verse number four,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.080
in verse number three says,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.520
for this is good and acceptable

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.000
in the sight of God our Savior,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.080
who will have all men to be saved

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.000
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.560
left the throne room of heaven

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560
to come to this sin-cursed world

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.440
to pay for the sin of mankind,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.560
and He is not willing that any should perish.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.680
Paul said this,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.280
this is a faithful saying

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.120
and worthy of all acceptation

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.600
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.600
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.960
Oh, praise the Lord.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.840
God's general will.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.200
All people to be saved,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.760
but then we can think about His general will

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.040
for His people, for those that are saved,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.960
for these believers in Colossae.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.000
You understand that it's God's will

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.640
for you to attend church.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.240
It's God's will for you to give to God.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.920
It's God's will for you to serve Him.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.320
It's God's will for you to share your faith.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.240
Those are all things that are revealed

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.240
in the Word of God that are His will for your life.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.840
Now you begin to understand

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840
that there are people that come

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.400
and they want to know God's specific will in their lives.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.400
What does God want me to do specifically?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.840
Generally speaking, we understand there's some things

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.920
that God has revealed with regard to His will

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.840
for all of His children,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.920
but then there's some specific things.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.440
I would say this,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.720
if you're not doing the general things

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.880
that are revealed in the Word of God

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.200
with regard to His will,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.520
don't expect God to show you the specifics.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.680
If you're not going to church faithfully,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.920
if you're not giving to God,

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.040
if you're not serving God,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.680
if you're not witnessing for God,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.680
if you're not doing the things

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.680
that are generally revealed in this precious book

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.720
with regard to His will for His people,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.560
why in the world would you think

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.720
that He is going to reveal to you

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.760
His specific will for your life?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.680
No, no.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.760
Do the will of God that you know

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.160
and seek God for the specific aspect

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.480
of His will for your life.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.480
Let me use this passage as an example.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.360
Acts chapter 16.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.160
Hold your place here in the book of Colossians.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.360
Go over to Acts chapter number 16, if you will.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.080
Acts chapter number 16 reveals to us

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.240
the passage of Scripture

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.720
in which they're going to go on this missionary journey

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.080
and all that's taking place.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:26.920
And it's interesting.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.200
I would ask this question.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.840
Is it God's will for us to preach the gospel?

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.680
Absolutely.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.200
Is it God's will that we preach the gospel

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.480
to every creature?

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.800
Absolutely.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.880
Go ye into all the world

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.160
and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.400
But here Paul is desiring to know specifically

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.920
where he is supposed to go to preach the gospel.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.840
Verse number six of Acts 16.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.040
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.880
the region of Galatia,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.840
and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.920
to preach the word in Asia,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.520
didn't God want them to hear?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.600
Sure He did.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.880
But this wasn't the exact time

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.160
in order for Paul to go into that place.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.520
In fact, as you study the word of God,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.560
you'll find as you read in Acts 19,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.320
and you don't need to go over there,

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.240
but you'll find that all of those in Asia

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.520
heard the word of the Lord,

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.760
but not at this time.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.840
Notice in verse number seven,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.200
after they were come to Mysia,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.280
they assayed to go into Bithynia,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.880
but the Spirit suffered them not.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.120
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas,

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.240
and a vision appeared to Paul in the night.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.160
There stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.520
saying, come over into Macedonia and help us.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.840
And after he had seen the vision,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.680
immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.240
assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.400
for to preach the gospel unto them.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.160
There was divine direction

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.120
because there was a heart of obedience.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.440
There was a desire on the part of the Apostle Paul

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.760
to do the specific will of God.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.560
He wasn't just going and doing what he wanted to do.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.000
He wasn't just looking for a place of comfort,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.200
a place of ease.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.640
He wasn't saying to God,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.080
I'll serve you, God, in these locations,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.880
but that's it, and it's on my terms.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.840
No, serving God is on His terms.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.600
What is His will?

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.160
And we get into the Bible

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.440
and we understand His general will for us,

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.280
and we're doing generally what He's revealed in His Word

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.840
with regard to His will.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.800
And then we say, God, what do You want for me specifically?

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.920
Lord, I'm Yours.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.280
You bought me with a price,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.880
and I want to glorify You in my life and with my life,

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.400
and I want to do what You want me to do

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.760
without any reservations.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.760
I believe that God will answer that prayer.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.040
We understand that in Acts 16,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.480
God gave him a vision

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.800
because the whole canon of Scripture

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.800
has not yet been written at that particular time.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.640
And God will answer your prayers.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.040
He'll use circumstances and He'll use events.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.000
He'll use people.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.480
And what a blessing to see how God opens doors

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.600
and to see how God reveals His will.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.560
He says this in verse number nine,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.720
that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.160
in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.280
Now, in light of the false teachers,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.760
we understand that it would not be the will of God

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.360
for these people to forsake the faithful teaching

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.120
that they had been given from Epaphras

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.600
as their faithful minister

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.840
and follow after these false teachers.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.360
That's not the will of God.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.520
Because the teaching, the instruction must line up

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.120
as we would say today in 2021 with the Word of God.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.640
We better be careful about knowing the will of God.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.440
Not only does Paul pray that they would know the will of God,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.960
but as we move into verse number 10,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.240
we find that he prays that they would do the will of God.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.120
Oh, that's the proper progression, by the way.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.320
If you know the will of God,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.920
you better be doing the will of God.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.840
A heart of obedience.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.920
The Bible says this in verse number 10,

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.240
that ye might walk worthy of the Lord

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.560
unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.760
and increasing in the knowledge of God.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.600
So in verse number nine,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.800
the prayer of Paul for these believers in Colossae

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.920
is that they would know the will of God.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.720
In verse number 10, it's that they would do the will of God,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.960
that they would be obedient,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.920
that they would be, as James says in James 1 in verse 22,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.440
not that we'd just be hearers of the Word,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.840
but that we'd be doers of the Word.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.560
That we would do the will of God.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.240
You know when we do the will of God, it pleases God.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.720
It's obedience.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.040
God is always pleased with obedience.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.400
Let me say this, if we know the will of God

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.400
and deliberately disobey what God has revealed to us to do,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.880
we are in some dangerous territory.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.720
We are on, as people like to use the expression, thin ice.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.840
See, God reveals His will, and then we do His will.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.840
Walk that ye might walk worthy of the Lord.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.080
Notice it says unto all pleasing,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.400
that I might please Him,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.320
that I might be accepted in His sight,

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.880
that He might be pleased with my service for Him.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.720
Why?

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.120
Because He's revealed to me what His will is,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.040
and I'm doing the will of God.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.640
Notice what Jesus said in John chapter number 13.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.160
We'll look at chapter 15 in just a moment,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.320
but look at John chapter number 13, if you will.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.720
In John chapter number 13 and verse number 17.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.680
Look at what the Lord Jesus Christ says

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.440
with regard to doing the will of God.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.680
He says this in John 13 and verse number 17.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.680
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.600
We understand that oftentimes that word happy is often,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.320
is also translated as blessed.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.560
And we think about the blessing of the Lord.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.880
See, He's speaking to them

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.540
about service in John 13.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.920
It's the passage of Scripture

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.400
in which Jesus washed the feet of the disciples.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.600
And He's revealing to them

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.360
this important aspect of service

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.640
and understanding that the servant

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.100
is not greater than his Lord

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.520
and so on and so forth.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.360
And He gave them an example

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.440
that you should do as I have done to you

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.880
is what He says in v. 15.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.840
And then He says,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.160
if you know these things,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.740
happy or blessed are ye if you do them.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.040
It's not just knowing it

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.480
that makes us happy or blessed.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.120
Well, I know the will of God for my life.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.040
Are you doing it?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.260
Paul is praying for these believers in Colossae

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.240
that they would know the will of God

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.920
and then that they would do the will of God.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.320
In 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.240
you don't need to turn there,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.600
but in verse number one,

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.080
Paul says this to the believers in Thessalonica.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.120
He says, furthermore,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.600
then we beseech you, brethren,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.720
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.840
that as ye have received of us

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.680
how ye ought to walk and to please God.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.540
So that would be the general will

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.240
for these believers in Thessalonica.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.100
That you have received of us

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.520
how you ought to walk and to please God.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.040
This is the general will

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.600
for the church of the Thessalonians.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.760
The church in Thessalonica.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.920
And we understand that

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.220
if it's the general will for this church,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.740
that the things that we would study and understand,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.800
it would be the general will for us as well.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.420
And it says this,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.640
so ye would abound more and more.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.900
See, when God reveals His will to us,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.900
He's revealing to us that we might please Him.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.620
He continues in this same passage

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.460
in 1 Thessalonians 4 and says this in verse 3,

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.900
for this is the will of God.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.380
Now when you read something like that,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.460
you ought to pay close attention.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.540
Right?

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.260
This is the general will of God for you.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.220
This is God's will for you,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.660
even your sanctification,

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:21.260
that ye should abstain from fornication.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.820
I'm not going to get off track this morning

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.500
with the content of our message,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.980
but you see that God reveals His general will

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.260
for His people.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.380
And then we do His will.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.380
Doing the will of God not only pleases Him,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.420
but doing the will of God produces fruit.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.760
It enables us to bear fruit.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.740
Notice in verse number 10 back in Colossians 1,

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.460
that ye might walk worthy of the Lord

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.460
unto all pleasing.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.500
Notice this,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.500
being fruitful in every good work

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.140
and increasing in the knowledge of God.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.460
And we'll get to that last statement in just a moment.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.740
But we notice where it says,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.140
being fruitful in every good work,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.860
you know that God's will is that we would bear fruit.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.060
That we would be fruitful.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.220
John chapter number 15,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.020
I mentioned that we would look there in just a moment.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.180
We're actually going to look there

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.780
a couple of times this morning.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.060
So if you have an extra bookmark,

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.180
you might want to put it there.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.300
But in John chapter number 15,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.220
you look through and you see about the bearing of fruit

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.220
and so on and so forth.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.060
In verse number seven,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.820
it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.900
you shall ask what you will

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.940
and it shall be done unto you.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.980
Herein is my Father glorified that you bear much fruit.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.460
So shall you be my disciples.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.300
God is glorified when we bear fruit.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.100
We're to be fruit bearing Christians.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.900
And when we're doing his will,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.980
it says this,

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.220
being fruitful in every good work.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.740
Wow, what a blessing.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.020
And then it says this,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.980
and increasing in the knowledge of God.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.820
You know that as God reveals truth to you

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.340
and you respond in obedience,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.100
that God's going to reveal more to you.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.020
It's an awesome truth that we find

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.620
in the pages of Scripture.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.340
Paul says that I may know him,

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.340
the power of his resurrection,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.700
there in the book of Philippians.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.180
And as we would think about Paul saying that,

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.100
he says that I may know him

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.180
and the power of his resurrection

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.500
and the fellowship of his sufferings

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.340
being made conformable unto his death.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.540
As Paul would walk in obedience to the Lord,

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.980
the Lord would continue to reveal more truth

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.060
and a greater knowledge of who God is.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.420
You understand that we'll never have

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.340
a complete knowledge of who God is

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.500
until we see him face to face.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.540
The reality is that he transcends us.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.820
His ways are not our ways.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.740
His thoughts are not our thoughts.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.540
He is so much greater and so much higher than we are.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.300
I've often said to people over the years

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.060
that you get in your mind

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.500
the greatest way in which you can understand God

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.940
and he's far beyond your greatest ability

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.140
to comprehend.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.900
But it says here, increasing in the knowledge of God.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.820
You know that I know more about God today

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.260
than I did 20 years ago.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.060
I do, why?

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.380
Not to pat myself on the back,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.980
but just to tell you the way that it works biblically

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.340
is that God has revealed some things to me about his will

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.220
and I've sought to obey those things.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.860
I've sought to do the will of God,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.060
not to just know it, but to do it.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.060
And as I have walked with God

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.460
and as I have served God,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.300
he's revealed more things to me about who he is

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.980
and what he's able to do.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.460
I have a greater knowledge of God today

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.740
than I did 20 years ago.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.220
I hope that you would look at your spiritual journey.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.140
I hope that you'd look at your walk with Christ

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.700
and that you would be able to say,

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.100
I have a greater knowledge of God today

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.580
than I did a year ago.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.660
That we do some evaluations in our lives.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.660
Why is that that I have a greater knowledge of God?

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.420
Well, if I look back over the last year,

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.260
I would see that I was walking with God

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.300
and I was serving God

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.820
and I was doing his will in my life

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.900
and then God reveals more of who he is.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.820
That's how Paul's praying for these believers.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.260
He says this in verse number 11.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.340
He's praying that they would have divine strength.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.020
Notice, strengthened with all might

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.900
according to his glorious power.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.300
We'll look at the last phrase in just a moment,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.940
but you understand what he's saying

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.620
and I'm looking at this as this divine strength.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.980
Maybe I could call it this, that divine ability.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.340
You understand this morning

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.540
that we cannot do the will of God

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.500
if we do not know the will of God.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.460
That's why Paul first prays that they would know it

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.500
and then he prays that they would do it,

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.540
but here's the reality.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.220
Not only am I not able to do the will of God

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.060
if I don't know the will of God,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.020
but the reality is that I need his enabling

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.940
in order to do his will.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.980
I can't do it in my own strength.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.020
I can't do it in my own power

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.980
and neither can you.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.980
It's not through my strength or through my power,

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.140
but it's through his Spirit.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.140
We read that in Zechariah 4 in verse number six

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.340
and we understand as we've mentioned already

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.860
that passage in John chapter number 15

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.940
about bearing fruit,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.980
but in verse number five of John chapter number 15,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.540
the Lord Jesus Christ said this,

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.060
I am the vine,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.860
ye are the branches.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.460
He that abideth in me and I in him,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.180
the same bringeth forth much fruit,

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.860
for without me ye can do nothing.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.460
If I don't know the will of God,

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.900
I can't do the will of God.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.220
If I know the will of God

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.700
and I desire to do the will of God,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.300
I need to be strengthened,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.260
I need to be enabled with his power to do his will.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.660
Thus, Paul is praying for these believers in Colossae

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.500
that they would know the will of God,

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.300
that they would do the will of God

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.540
and that they would have divine strength or ability.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.180
The Bible says in Acts 1 in verse number eight,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.220
but you shall receive power

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.660
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.700
and ye shall be witnesses unto me

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.460
both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.820
and into the uttermost part of the earth.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.940
And you understand that the reality

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.300
is that they stayed in that upper room

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.540
until they were endued with power.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.780
It was not appropriate for them to leave

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.740
and try to go do the will of God,

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.020
the work of God without having the enabling of God.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.500
The disciples prayed in Acts 4 in verse number 29

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.140
that God would grant them boldness to speak thy word.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.860
Was it God's will for them to speak the word of God?

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.140
Absolutely.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.940
But they understood that they needed Holy Spirit boldness

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.540
and power to be able to do the will of God.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.340
Oh, this morning we need the power of God.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.380
We need his power to rest upon us.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.380
So Paul, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.380
we first consider how Paul prayed.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.940
The spiritual aspect of his prayer.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.940
The knowledge that he had that we dealt with

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.140
by way of introduction,

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.500
no doubt influenced the manner in which he prayed.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.740
The things that he prayed for,

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.860
he prayed that they would know the will of God.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.220
They would do the will of God.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.620
And that they would have the strength,

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.980
that divine strength as they would serve God.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.940
James said this,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.420
for him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.660
to him it is sin.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.300
If you know the will of God and you refuse to do it,

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.060
you need to ask God to forgive you.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.460
You need to confess it as being sin.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.420
Say, God, forgive me.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.100
And he will.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.740
He is faithful and just.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.220
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.940
If we confess our sins,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.300
he's promised that he would give us forgiveness.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.020
With thee, the psalmist said, there is forgiveness.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.060
Our God is ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.060
But if you know the will of God and you're not doing it,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.100
oh, would you get that right with God?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.740
Not only confess it as being sin,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.020
but pray and ask God to help you to do his will.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.860
You know, there's no greater joy

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.660
than doing the will of God.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.260
Honestly, there's no greater joy

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.620
than knowing the will of God and doing the will of God.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.700
I'm not pretending, I'm not trying to just make you think.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:08.420
a certain way, I'm being completely transparent and honest with you. There is a joy in doing

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:17.060
the will of God that far surpasses anything else that this world ever has to offer. So

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.220
therefore, Paul prays that they would know the will of God, they would do the will of

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:26.380
God, and they would do it with divine strength or ability. Notice not only as we consider

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:33.580
what Paul prayed, or how Paul prayed, we also consider what is produced. I would say this,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:39.660
as we look at 11 through 14, that really as we would look at this aspect of what is produced,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:46.980
I would say it this way, these are the results of the request of the Apostle Paul. As he's

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:53.340
praying this way, as he's expecting God to answer these prayers, as he's expecting these

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.980
believers in Colossae to be obedient and to do the will of God, this is what's going

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:04.140
to be produced. This is what the result is going to be. You understand that if I pray

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:09.540
that God would reveal His will, that you as a child of God would know the will of God,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.420
that that's a prayer that God desires to answer. And as you would pray for yourself, that God,

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.180
would you make known to me your will, and you have other brothers and sisters that are

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:25.220
interceding on your behalf for that request, that God will answer that and it produces some things.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:32.820
See, Paul understood as he's praying that this is not some rote religious activity. He's praying

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:40.860
to the God of the universe, and he's expecting that God's going to work. He's praying in faith,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:49.500
believing. Notice what is produced. Number one, I would say this, spiritual maturity. That's what

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.220
the whole aspect of this prayer has been. We've mentioned it often throughout the message already,

00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:00.100
as we would know the will of God and do the will of God, that this spiritual maturity is

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:06.620
produced in the child of God. These believers in Colossae that have been saved and that have

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:12.300
been discipled, Paul is praying that they would mature spiritually, and we understand that that

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.300
spiritual maturity is seen through what is mentioned in the end of verse number 11. Notice,

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.660
I'll read the entire verse, strengthened with all might according to His glorious power, but then we

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:27.420
begin to see this answer, this spiritual maturity, that which is produced. It says at the end of verse

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:35.380
number 11, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness. Let's look at those three words.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:41.700
Patience, long-suffering, and then he says joyfulness. So we think about this spiritual

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:49.060
maturity. It's evidenced through patience. You say, I don't have any patience. And you say,

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.860
somebody yesterday or somebody some time ago told me that I shouldn't pray for patience,

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.340
because if I pray for patience, that means God's going to give me trials. I've heard that said over

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:07.060
the years, and the reality is that this word patience, it carries with it the idea of endurance.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:15.820
It carries with it the idea of steadfastness. And really, when we think about this patience

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:24.140
that is mentioned in verse number 11, it really is geared more towards patience in circumstances.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.500
Now, before you get excited and think that that means you don't have to have patience with people,

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.980
just put your seatbelt on. We'll be there in just a moment. But first, he deals with patience,

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:43.700
endurance, steadfastness in our circumstances. You know, sometimes those circumstances,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:50.460
we are so much in a hurry to get those over with that we miss the spiritual lesson,

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.780
that we miss the purpose that God has in that circumstance, in that situation.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.500
Notice, you'll recall with me a great truth from 1 Corinthians 15 in verse number 58.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.700
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast. Right? Remember, I said that word patience,

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:14.380
it has the idea of endurance, it has the idea of steadfastness. Be steadfast, unmovable,

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:20.059
always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:26.380
in the Lord. See, as you know the will of God and you purpose to do the will of God through the

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.700
enabling of God, it doesn't mean that the enemy is going to go retreat somewhere and say,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:35.020
hey, they know God's will and they've purposed to do it, so I'm going to leave them alone.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.500
No, no, no, no. He's going to just up the attack. So we've got to have patience,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.020
we've got to have endurance and steadfastness. What did Paul say

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.140
as he's writing? I believe I know all year last year I wrote when I studied and taught through

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.660
the book of Hebrews, I refrained from using an author, humanly speaking. I believe Paul wrote

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.500
the book of Hebrews. If you don't, that's okay, we can disagree. There's no authorship that's

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:07.820
notated. But notice what is said in Hebrews 12. We used verse number two of Hebrews 12 as our

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.460
theme for last year, looking unto Jesus. But in verse number one of Hebrews 12, the Bible says,

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:18.620
we're foreseeing we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:25.500
Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with

00:45:26.779 --> 00:45:35.100
patience the race that is set before us. That's a result of, or an evidence, excuse me,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:41.260
that is an evidence of spiritual maturity. That patience, that endurance, that steadfastness,

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.580
then he goes and he says back in Colossians chapter number one,

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:54.380
verse 11, unto all patience and longsuffering. The word longsuffering carries with it the idea

00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:03.660
of being slow to wrath, patience of offense. This is where we see the longsuffering as it relates

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:11.420
really to people. Patience relating more to circumstances, and longsuffering relating more

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:21.420
to people. Slow to wrath, patience of offense, not looking to get or seek revenge, but having

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:27.340
that longsuffering. I'm thankful that God has longsuffering. I mean, honestly.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:36.540
There are many times in our lives that we have experienced the longsuffering of God.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.820
There are times in our lives when we might look at some situation and say,

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:50.460
I'm not sure why God doesn't judge them, but I'll tell you that in your life and in my life,

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:56.460
I'm happy and thankful for the longsuffering of God. And God's longsuffering with people,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:04.300
and this evidence of spiritual maturity, that which is produced the result of the prayer of

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.300
the Apostle Paul, is that they would have patience, that they would have endurance and

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.300
steadfastness in the circumstances in which they would face, that they would have longsuffering,

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:18.140
that they would be slow to wrath, that they would have patience of offense with regard to people.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:24.220
And then the Bible says this, with joyfulness, with joyfulness,

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.900
joyfulness, the idea of fullness of joy. We've often said that joy and happiness are similar,

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:37.660
but they're also very different because oftentimes happiness is dependent upon our happenings,

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:42.380
the things that are going on. But as we understand the truth of the Word of God,

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:49.420
that we can have a joy that's not based upon my circumstances or my happenings.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:56.059
I can be in the midst of a great difficulty and yet have great joy.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:03.500
If I were to ask you this morning, which book of the Bible would you go to in the New Testament

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:12.540
to think about that which deals with in the greatest aspect of joy, rejoicing,

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:19.980
joyfulness? Brianna's lipping, wording to me, Philippians. Yeah, Philippians.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:28.620
That's what I would say as well. Where was Paul? Prison. His circumstances weren't great,

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:37.260
but he had joy. He had joy. I love the little song. I don't remember all the words. It's kind

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:44.059
of a common occurrence for me, actually. The little song goes this way, at least part of it,

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:47.980
that we would sing with children. I remember years and years ago in children's church singing

00:48:48.940 --> 00:49:01.500
with kids, I've got joy down in my heart. Deep, deep down in my heart. J-O-Y down in my heart.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:12.619
Then it would say something on this matter of Jesus gave it to me and nothing can destroy it.

00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:16.940
And I remember doing with those little kids as we'd have children's church, I can see it in my

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.900
mind's eye of the building that I was in and seeing those kids in front of me that are now adults

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:30.460
and saying it's deep, deep down in my heart. Jesus gave it to me and nothing we would do

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:37.980
that with the kids can destroy it. Listen, no man can take your joy. We have to give it up.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:45.820
Spiritual maturity is evidenced through patience and long-suffering and joyfulness. Not only

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.140
do we see what is produced as being spiritual maturity, but I also see that what's being

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:57.580
produced is a spirit of gratitude. Notice in verse number 12, giving thanks unto the Father.

00:49:58.299 --> 00:50:02.540
Giving thanks unto the Father. Why is it

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.460
that the Apostle Paul would mention here,

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.960
what is the subject, if you will,

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.500
the reason for giving thanks?

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.920
Well, broadly speaking,

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.000
with one word, we'd say redemption.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.300
That's the reason in these verses of Scripture.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.640
And I would say this,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.720
you are thankful for your salvation

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.840
that it will lead to you having a spirit of gratitude

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.480
in other areas of your life as well.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.400
We must never get over our salvation.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.060
We must never cease to thank God

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:37.000
for what He did in saving our souls.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.540
Consider what He's done for you.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.920
Notice, as he would use a number of phraseologies

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.100
in order to describe this subject matter of redemption,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.940
he says, giving thanks unto the Father.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.140
Notice in v. 12, the first aspect, if you will,

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:57.480
which hath made us meet to be partakers

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.120
of the inheritance of the saints in light.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.540
Now, this is a great phrase, a great statement,

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.620
a great truth of the Word of God.

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.200
I want you to really focus upon where it says there,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.460
which hath made us meet to be partakers.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.580
You know, that word meet

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.220
carries with it the idea of being qualified.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.840
Being qualified.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.380
What am I qualified for?

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.140
Well, it says this,

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.800
to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.800
God has made me qualified for heaven.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.180
Can you imagine?

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.440
This is amazing as we would begin to think about

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.320
what Paul is communicating

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.360
and the way in which we would pause

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.400
and just think about how He's made us meet,

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.360
that He's made us qualified for heaven.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.080
Listen, you can't qualify yourself for heaven,

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.780
and I can't qualify myself for heaven,

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.320
but God can qualify us for heaven.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.660
2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21,

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.860
for He, speaking of God the Father,

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.080
hath made Him, speaking of God the Son,

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.620
to be sin for us who knew no sin,

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:17.380
that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.040
The imputed righteousness of Christ.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.920
I can't make myself qualified for heaven

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.920
and neither can you.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.500
Mr. Black that wrote that song

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.920
that we started the service with this morning,

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920
when he said,

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.220
when the roll is caught up yonder, I'll be there.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.300
He didn't qualify himself for heaven,

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.800
but he understood that the Son of God

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.760
came to this incursed world.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.920
He bled and died.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.540
He paid the ultimate price and He saved His soul.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.920
Thus, He was qualified for heaven.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.080
He hath made us meet to be partakers

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.120
of the inheritance of the saints in light.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.920
Not only that, look at the next phrase in verse number 13.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.540
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.740
Now you understand that there is a power of darkness.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:16.120
The spirit of iniquity doth already work,

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.420
and we see that as Paul would write

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.540
to the believers in Thessalonica,

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.620
and he says in 2 Thessalonians 2, in verse number 7,

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.540
for the mystery of iniquity doth already work.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.160
We understand that the Bible teaches

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.620
and gives us truth with regard to the way

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.460
in which we were bound in our sin.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.380
The Bible tells us how the God of this world,

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.080
the little g God of this world,

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.880
the enemy, Satan, Lucifer,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.740
that he hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.160
Listen, there is a power of darkness,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.080
but Paul said this in Ephesians chapter number 2,

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.200
when he spoke about that power of darkness,

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.540
he says in Ephesians 2, in verse number 1,

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.280
and you hath he quickened

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.320
who were dead in trespass and sins,

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.960
wherein in time past you walked

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.460
according to the course of this world,

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.920
according to the prince of the power of the air,

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.120
the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.200
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past,

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.540
in the lust of our flesh,

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.740
fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind,

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.960
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others,

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.960
but God, who is rich in mercy,

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.780
for his great love wherewith he loved us.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.200
He says to these believers in Colossae,

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.820
he says, listen, you need to remember

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:39.040
that he hath delivered us from the power of darkness.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.780
Paul, he was delivered from the power of darkness.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.200
These saints that he's writing to,

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.620
these faithful brethren in Colossae,

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.460
they had been delivered from the power of darkness.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.780
Notice the next phrase at the end of verse number 13.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:58.580
And hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.200
Listen, there was a transaction that took place

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.200
on the day in which you trust at Christ as your Savior.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.880
There was a transaction that took place in my life

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.500
on August 31st, 1997.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.340
It was a transaction that I understand more about today

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.840
than I did then.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.760
But there was a transaction that took place.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.060
No longer was I going to go and spend eternity

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.560
in the lake of fire because of my sin,

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.140
because I had no Savior.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.640
But there was a transaction that was made.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.680
As the songwriter said, the old account was settled

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.880
long ago, right?

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.880
He spoke about his day of conversion.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.060
And now in a moment, the miracle of salvation,

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.260
my home is heaven.

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.220
I've been translated into the kingdom of his dear Son.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.680
A great transaction that took place.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.460
I use the term transaction as it says here,

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:50.960
that and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.060
because a transaction would be a term

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.640
that would help us to understand that which was accomplished

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.380
on the day of our salvation.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.340
Of course, understanding that for us,

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.920
a couple of thousand years prior to the day of our salvation

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.980
is when the blood was shed, when the payment was made.

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.300
But we understand the wages of sin is death.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.340
But the gift of God is eternal life

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.920
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.380
And there was a payment that was made,

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.260
a transaction that was completed.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.500
We were translated into the kingdom of his dear Son.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.800
We were delivered from the power of darkness

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.020
and translated into the kingdom of his dear Son.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.920
It's an amazing transaction.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.880
It's a supernatural transaction.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.720
You understand that salvation is not a process.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.940
Salvation is the miracle of a moment.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.800
The Bible says that you must be born again.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.340
And it's in that moment that we're translated,

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.880
we're delivered from the power of darkness,

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.180
we're translated into the kingdom of his Son.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.840
Oh, what a blessing!

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.980
Verse 14, the fourth statement.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.020
In whom we have redemption through his blood,

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:12.260
through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.440
In whom we have redemption.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.040
I'm thankful for that word redemption.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.460
I've been bought.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.180
But how is it that we have redemption?

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:27.100
Those three precious words that are so vital,

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.600
through his blood.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.360
Ephesians 1 deals with the plan of redemption,

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.640
also deals with the price of redemption.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.180
The precious blood of Christ.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.700
In the book of 1 Peter, we will understand the truth

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:47.980
that we were redeemed.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:49.880
Notice this is what Peter says in 1 Peter 1,

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.160
in verse number 18.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.100
For as much as you know that you were not redeemed

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.640
with corruptible things as silver and gold

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.060
from your vain conversation received by tradition

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:02.580
from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ,

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.820
the blood of a lamb without blemish and without spot.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.640
I'm so thankful for the precious blood of Christ.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.020
I was redeemed with his blood.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.600
You know those three words through his blood are vital.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.840
Because that's the only way for someone to be redeemed.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.480
Redeemed how I love to proclaim it.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.540
Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.400
Right, is that what the songwriter said?

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.720
Bible, Bible truth in that great hymn of the faith.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.380
You know that the enemy,

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.260
this is just a side note this morning,

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.020
but for what it's worth, you get a little extra.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.340
You're not here, so you don't have to have

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.620
extra time to cook.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.680
And so therefore I give you a little extra this morning.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.240
The enemy is attacking the word of God.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.660
He has from Genesis chapter number three.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.820
When he said this, yea, hath God said.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.300
You know the Bible is under attack

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.380
from that day until this.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.340
I looked up yesterday, I knew that a number

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.320
of the modern translations had attacked

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.820
this particular verse of scripture.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.400
I did not know how many of them.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.800
But I looked up a number of them yesterday.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.280
I will say this, I don't have any of them in my office.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.120
I had to look them up on the internet.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.600
The NIV, the New American Standard Bible,

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.140
the Revised Standard Version,

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.020
the New Revised Standard Version,

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.260
the New Living Translation,

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.240
the English Standard Version.

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.220
Those were the six that I looked at in particular.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:38.520
Every one of them has removed those three words

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.020
through His blood.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.200
And they would read, in whom we have redemption,

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.360
even the forgiveness of sins.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.560
How do we have redemption?

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.060
Through the blood!

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.760
There's no other way!

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.420
We preach the blood, the book, the prophet,

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.360
or the blessed hope.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.700
We understand the importance.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.540
the importance, the significance of the blood.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.840
You look at the Old Testament

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.340
and all of the sacrifices

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.940
and all the blood that would point to Messiah Christ

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.100
who would one day come

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.220
and make one perfect offering

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.580
for sin forever.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.100
And it was the precious blood of Christ.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.140
And oh, how the enemy is attacking

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.500
the Word of God.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.100
This morning, I would encourage you

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.260
to be careful of the modern translations.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.180
I've taught many lessons

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.940
on this pulpit

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:38.220
on the reason in which we use the King James Bible.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.860
If you'd like to have any of those,

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.420
let me know. I'd be happy to share those with you.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.780
But the modern translations are being attacked

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.380
by the enemy.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.460
And in this verse of Scripture,

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.980
they remove the blood.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.660
Oh, I hope that we would be careful.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.300
Do not buy the lie of the enemy

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.260
that says, well, these modern translations

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.020
are just easier to understand.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.300
It's not true.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.340
And here's the amazing thing.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.900
If you've been born again,

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.460
the Spirit of God lives within you

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.780
and He is the divine teacher.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.660
And so when you come to a passage of Scripture

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.940
that you don't understand,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.780
you say, Holy Spirit that lives within me,

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.660
teach me Thy Word!

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.300
And He will.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.540
He will.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.580
We said it a moment ago,

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.140
that being thankful for your salvation

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.660
will lead to a spirit of gratitude

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.780
in other areas of your life.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.420
We understand that Paul would say this

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.220
to the believers in Thessalonica

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.500
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 18.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.980
In everything, give thanks.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.660
And then notice this phrase.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.020
For this is the will of God

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.020
in Christ Jesus concerning you.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.620
Now, remember the entirety of this prayer.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.140
Isn't it amazing how it just kind of

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.180
packages real nice?

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.260
I mean, it's got a bow on it for us.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.820
Paul, in one of his earlier works,

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.220
speaks about the spirit of gratitude.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.020
He says, I'm praying that you would know

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.420
the will of God, and then as you know

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.780
the will of God, that you would do

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.060
the will of God through His enabling.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.300
It's not in your own strength.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.460
It's in His strength.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.940
And here's what will be produced

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.420
that you will have this spiritual maturity

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.260
that will be evidenced through patience

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.420
and long suffering.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.180
And it will be evidenced through the joy

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:21.980
that you have.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.620
And he says that you'll have a spirit

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.540
of gratitude first and foremost

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.460
for your salvation because of what

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.700
He did for you and how He saved your soul.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.900
That transaction that was completed.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.580
And then, that you'll have this spirit

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.940
of gratitude that will then kind of

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.420
convey over into other areas of your life,

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.660
which by the way, is the will of God.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.700
That we'd give thanks for all things.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.220
In everything, give thanks.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.260
For this is the will of God

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.100
in Christ Jesus concerning you.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.500
You say, I have a hard time giving thanks

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.740
for everything, in everything,

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.140
for all things.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.340
Ask God to help you.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.260
I don't like this thing.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.380
I don't like what's going on.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.500
I'm not happy with this.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.620
Is God sovereign or not?

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.100
Is God still on His throne

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.060
or is somebody taking His place?

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.020
No, He is still in control.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.940
He rules and He reigns.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.260
He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:23.340
Therefore, we're able to give thanks

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.780
in everything.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.420
Understanding this is the will of God for us.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.100
Aren't you happy that God gave us a Bible?

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.660
And revealed to us His general will

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.420
for His people?

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.300
What was one of the things?

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.380
I mean, I know there are many things

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.300
that the children of Israel were guilty of,

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.820
but one of them was murmuring

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.740
and complaining all of the time.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.420
God wasn't pleased with that.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.780
And still today, God's not pleased

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.900
when we murmur and complain.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.260
We're to be thankful.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.460
The spirit of gratitude

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.420
is produced in the believer

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.020
that is growing spiritually.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.380
This morning, as I mentioned before,

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.660
we got into the points.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.140
I wonder if we would take some time

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:12.020
and evaluate our prayer life.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.820
And as we evaluate our prayer life,

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.140
that we would evaluate it

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:20.340
in light of the example in Scripture.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.100
I'm not saying to you this morning

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.020
that you should not pray

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.340
for the physical needs of others.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.059
You should.

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:29.740
But what I'm asking you is,

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.420
is that all that you're praying for?

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.380
If you evaluate your prayer life,

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.740
is there anything that's spiritual?

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.420
Are you praying for the spiritual growth

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.820
of yourself, of others,

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.740
as we think about intercessory prayer in particular?

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.220
You're praying for others to grow in grace

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.340
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.380
That in the time of difficulty,

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.740
adversity, in the storm,

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.660
that they would grow spiritually.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:04.900
That they would understand that God is faithful.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.980
That God is dependable, trustworthy.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.500
That He never makes a mistake.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.220
That His way is perfect.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.300
And that we would learn those things.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.540
Oh, this morning, I hope that we've been encouraged

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.740
by the way in which Paul prayed

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.300
for these believers in Colossae.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.340
But I also pray that we've been challenged

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.300
to evaluate our own prayer lives.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.180
Evaluate them in light of Scripture.

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.779
Let's pray.

01:05:31.779 --> 01:05:33.820
Father, we love You this morning.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.980
We thank You so much for loving us.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.540
We thank You for the Word of God.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.820
We thank You for the prayer of Paul

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.740
for the Colossians.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.500
Thank You that You've recorded it in Your Word

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.500
that we can look at it and read it

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:53.420
and dissect it and be challenged by it.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.540
Be encouraged by it.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.340
Lord, I pray this morning that if there's one

01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.300
that does not know You

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.779
as their personal Lord and Savior,

01:06:01.779 --> 01:06:03.700
that transaction that we spoke of,

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.020
those statements that were made...
