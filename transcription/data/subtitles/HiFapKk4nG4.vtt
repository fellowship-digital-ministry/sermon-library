WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.039
through 16, and a very familiar passage of Scripture, and I hope this evening as we study

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:13.079
through this portion that we would have a renewed commitment to be what God has called

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.239
us to be.

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:19.399
I believe that each one of us this evening could readily admit and acknowledge that we're

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:21.280
living in a very dark world.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.600
We're living in a time, as Paul described it when he was writing to Timothy, that we're

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.760
living in those last days and that perilous times would come.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.119
We understand that he further gave instruction to Timothy in the last book that he wrote,

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:40.040
2 Timothy, in the fourth chapter, about the importance of preaching the Word of God and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.200
sharing with Timothy that the time would come when men will not endure sound doctrine.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.439
And indeed, we're living in a time that was described even of Judah and Israel in the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:55.720
Old Testament as a time in which they call evil good and good evil, a time in which they

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.119
legislate wickedness, but it is a time in which we have the unique privilege of embracing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:08.000
the responsibility that has been entrusted to us and being the light that God has called

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.120
us to be.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.080
As you walk into our auditorium each and every time that you walk in, and I know for those

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720
of us that maybe have just kind of gotten accustomed to it, we've been here for a length

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.519
of time, that we see as you walk in on the right-hand side, send the light, and there

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:29.360
are two lighthouses up there with the imagery that would be desiring to send the light to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.519
the entire globe, to the entire world, that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ would

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:39.279
go forth and shine forth brightly.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:44.040
As you look as you walk in on the left of our auditorium, you have this missions map

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.440
that back in 2012 we put that together, and it's interesting as you would begin to understand

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.080
the concepts behind this map and really the reasoning for why we laid it out the way that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.120
we did, but you push one of those tiles and that light will light up to show the region

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.880
in which that particular missionary serves God and is seeking to take the gospel to that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.960
part of the earth.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.399
And as we think about the light on the map and as you would push an individual tile and

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:22.160
you would see that little LED that travels through a fiber optic cable light up on that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.000
map, that you would be reminded of not only the location but really the purpose in which

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that missionary has been sent there.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.679
We do not send missionaries to go to various countries around the world to enjoy the climate

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:42.880
and to enjoy the beauty of the particular countries and to live a life of pleasure and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.399
ease and vacation.

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:50.440
No, we send them there, though they may enjoy some of those things, we send them there with

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.119
the express purpose of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to be the light that we are

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.360
called to be.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.600
Obviously, God will call some to go to a specific location, to go and to give their lives in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.320
that particular arena and to be a full-time, if you will, Christian servant, but we find

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.000
that the Bible speaks of individual believers as being the light of the world.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.240
And as we would begin to look at this familiar passage of Scripture and we would acknowledge

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.360
the fact that we're living in a very dark world, we would also come to the conclusion

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.199
that it is absolutely imperative that at this moment we let our light shine.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:40.360
It's a dark world that we're living in and the light needs to shine brightly.

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:46.199
If you've ever gone into a room that was dark, have you ever tried to navigate some steps

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.960
or some particular terrain and it's dark, what do you look for?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.800
You want to have a light.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.720
And we give out those flashlight, the keychain flashlights, and we have those that we give

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.559
out regularly.

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:04.160
And man, I was somewhere just the other day before we went on vacation, so a couple of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.320
weeks ago, and I needed a light.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.479
It was dark in the room and I went to push that button to turn on the light and it was

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.479
dead.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.919
Man, that was unfortunate.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:22.760
I could not complete the task that I set out to complete because I could not see what was

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760
before me.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.000
It was just too dark.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.559
I just couldn't navigate.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:30.720
I couldn't get to where I wanted to get to without a light.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.839
And as we think about the darkness in which we are living in and we think about the particular

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:42.480
culture and society in which we're faced with, we understand that God is not surprised

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
by any of these things.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
He knows.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480
He knew.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
He's all-knowing.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.239
He transcends time.

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:53.839
And so He provided a solution for this dark world, and that is that we are the light of

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.839
the world.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.720
Notice what it says in Matthew 5, verses 14 through 16.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.920
The Bible says this,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.320
Ye are the light of the world.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.559
A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:14.440
Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.880
And it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.160
Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.739
which is in heaven.

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.019
I've titled the message this evening, You Are the Light of the World.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:38.619
We begin to think about these pictures and this imagery that we have on the walls of

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.820
our auditorium this evening, and as I think about those lighthouses to my left, to your

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.220
right, and I think about the lighthouse, and obviously we were in contact with lighthouses

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.779
when we were on vacation, and I began to think about and just kind of meditate upon and do

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.059
a little research about lighthouses.

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.980
And I looked up what the roles and responsibilities were of the lighthouse keepers.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.260
Now we understand today, with the technological advancements that have been made, that the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.540
roles and responsibilities have changed drastically over the years.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:22.339
But you understand the significant role that lighthouse keepers played in providing navigational

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.779
assistance to those that were traveling very difficult seas.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.179
And we find that these lighthouse keepers, they had the responsibilities to trim the

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.299
wicks, to replenish the fuel.

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:42.619
Some of them, in fact, their fuel source, way back at the end of the 19th century, the

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:50.299
middle of the 19th century, many of the fuel sources were whale oil, and they would use

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:56.739
various things, and they would have the responsibility of going and getting that fuel and ensuring

00:06:56.739 --> 00:07:03.540
that the fuel was replenished, that they did not run out of fuel at the wrong time.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.880
We find that they had the responsibility of winding the clockworks.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.660
We find that they had the responsibility of cleaning the lenses and the windows.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.739
So you think about the lens and the window of those lights, and you think about the way

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:25.779
in which it could get dirty from the environment, from those things that are going to affect it.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:32.500
You could understand how that a dirty lens or a dirty window would not allow for the

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.019
light to shine in the manner in which it's supposed to shine.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.779
And so these were some of the roles and responsibilities of these lighthouse keepers.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:45.380
I did some further research to think about some of those lighthouses that are down in

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.779
the Outer Banks region of North Carolina, and the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, they say

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:54.100
that you can see it 20 miles out to sea.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:08:00.660
That's a long, long distance, but if you know anything about the sea and the topography,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:09.140
if you will, of the sea on the coast of that part of North Carolina, many, many ships found

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.059
a fateful end because of those sandbars and the currents and all of the things that were

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:16.059
out there.

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.940
So Cape Hatteras is a lighthouse there.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.179
It could be seen 20 miles out to sea.

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:23.619
Ocracoke Lighthouse, 14 miles.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:25.940
Body Island Lighthouse, 19 miles.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.100
And Kuratuk, 18 miles.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.500
Those are long distances.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.820
You think about the light, and you think about the truth that God has given us, and we look

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.419
at some of those things in our world, and we see that I would use that as an illustration

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:48.940
this evening, because in our text, Jesus uses some basic logic with the disciples.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.500
He's speaking to the disciples, and He says to them in verse number 14,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.020
Ye are the light of the world.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.500
Now that's a pretty simple statement, is it not?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.539
I mean, there's not a whole lot of difficulty on the part of the reader to understand, on

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:08.859
the part of the recipient, to understand what Jesus was saying.

00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:10.960
Ye are the light of the world.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.599
But then notice the logic that Jesus uses when He's explaining to the disciples this

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.000
responsibility that they have.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.080
The Bible says this, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.159
Have you ever driven at night through maybe some part of the country, whether here in

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:38.640
the United States of America or some other place, and you were traveling through just

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.679
a remote area of the country, and as you would drive through at night, it seems like

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:48.200
it's just dark in any direction you could look, and you travel a little while, and maybe

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.200
up on a hill, you'll see that there's some lights, and as you get closer and closer,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.760
there are more and more lights.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.479
As we traveled in Nevada back when I was a teenager, living there for a couple of years,

00:09:59.479 --> 00:10:00.479
often, you'll see some lights, and as you get closer and closer, there are more and

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:00.479


00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:06.839
And you could travel just, I mean, miles and miles and miles and not see anyone or anything,

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:11.019
but you would always, if you were traveling at night, you could see those little towns

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:12.519
or cities.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:20.599
And Jesus says to the disciples, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid because of

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:25.959
its location and because of the light that would come from that particular city and the

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.599
inhabitants of the city.

00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:28.599
Notice what he says in verse 15.

00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:35.679
I mean, this is simple logic that is getting conveyed to the disciples here.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:43.519
He says, neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.359
Why is it that you would light a candle?

00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:47.319
Now you say, well, I light a candle for fragrance.

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:49.279
Well, that's because you have electricity.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.279
Amen.

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:54.439
And if you don't have electricity, you light a candle for what purpose?

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:55.879
Light.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.719
That's the purpose of lighting a candle.

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:06.639
We find that there are times in which maybe we're dealing with some storm, maybe a particular

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:11.079
hurricane or tornadoes enter to a particular region, and there are people that will get

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:15.639
supplies so that they can deal with life without electricity.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:20.519
We're not very used to dealing with life without electricity, but we find that candles are

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.139
a source of light.

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.859
Someone said that crayons will burn.

00:11:24.859 --> 00:11:28.259
If you light them, they'll burn just like a candle, and they'll provide light.

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:31.659
Now some of you are going to go home and test that and see if it works.

00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:36.579
And I've never tested it, but I've just been told that it works that way, that a crayon

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.339
will burn like a candle.

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:42.579
But you understand, if you're using a candle, think about the time in which Jesus is speaking

00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:44.619
to the disciples in the first century.

00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:49.899
He says this, neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:50.899
Why?

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.579
Because the very purpose of lighting that candle is to give light.

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:58.379
Not to cover it, but to give light.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:02.339
We sing with the kids, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine,

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:05.939
let it shine, let it shine, hide it under a bushel.

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:07.339
No!

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:08.859
Right?

00:12:08.859 --> 00:12:14.019
We understand as we would look at the logic here and the explanation that Jesus is giving.

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:20.499
He says this, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:21.779
What did it do?

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:24.859
It fulfilled its purpose, right?

00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:27.659
You light the candle so that you can have light.

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:32.979
You don't put it under a bushel, but you put it on a candlestick, and as you light that

00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:40.459
candle that is then placed on a candlestick, it gives light to those that are in that house,

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.599
fulfilling the purpose.

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:46.919
We find that Jesus then says in verse number 16,

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:50.679
Let your light so shine.

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:52.759
Notice what he says.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:13:03.239
How or where before men, why that they may see your good works and glorify your Father

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:05.559
which is in heaven.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:11.279
What a great truth that we have in this portion of Scripture.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:16.559
This evening if I were to submit to you some points or thoughts with regard to this passage,

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:20.199
I would say, first of all, that we have a role.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.959
Ye are the light of the world.

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:25.759
That's a settled truth, amen?

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:29.999
Jesus said to the disciples as he's speaking to them, ye are the light of the world.

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:35.639
He did not say to the disciples, do you want to be the light of the world?

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:40.999
He didn't say, would you like to sign up for this job to be the light of the world?

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:49.039
No, he declared to them, ye are the light of the world.

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.639
This is a role that we have.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:56.439
This is something that we must understand biblically and scripturally that Jesus has

00:13:56.439 --> 00:14:00.959
said to the disciples and I believe that as we have the preserved word of God, that we

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:08.039
as the believers here in 2021, that Jesus would still say to us as his followers, as

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:13.719
followers of Jesus Christ, that ye are the light of the world.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:17.559
He's not asking us to volunteer to be the light of the world.

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:21.679
He's telling them that they are the light of the world.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:31.319
Now understanding your role does not mean that you're going to fulfill your role, right?

00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:35.879
We see that he declares to them what their role is.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:37.439
He says ye are the light of the world.

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:43.279
He uses that logic and explanation that we just went over in those verses of scripture

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:46.519
to help them understand what he means by this.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.599
And we understand this evening that as we would look at this truth that he says, you're

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:57.919
the light of the world, therefore let your light so shine, he says, before men that they

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:03.399
may see your good works and glorify your father, which is in heaven.

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:06.399
This is the role that we have.

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.399
The role that we have.

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:14.319
I want you to hold your place here and turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:20.039
To me, it seems like time gets blurred.

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:24.879
I don't know how it is for you, but there are times in which I will make a statement

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:26.599
in Ephesians chapter number five.

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:32.199
I'll make a statement in which I'll say just a few months ago, such and such happened.

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:35.439
And then I begin to look back at a calendar and find out that that was a couple of years

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:36.679
ago.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:40.839
And I'm not sure how that works for you, but sometimes things just kind of get blurred

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.839
in our minds.

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:47.399
So it was a couple of years ago, I don't remember, I think it was in 2019, I might

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:51.519
be wrong, but I preached through the book of Ephesians.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:55.199
As I preached through the book of Ephesians, the book of Ephesians is just a great book.

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:59.999
I mean, obviously all of the Bible is just so wonderful, it's given to us, it's profitable

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:00.999
for us.

00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:06.679
But the book of Ephesians is a book in which the apostle Paul is writing to these believers

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:14.519
in this city and he's sharing with them and establishing for them their position in Christ

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.239
in the first few chapters.

00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:22.919
And what a blessing to understand in those first few chapters of the book of Ephesians,

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:30.279
chapters one, two and three, how that we have this position in Christ, that we are saved.

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:31.559
We've been redeemed.

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:37.279
In the first chapter, he goes through the truth with regard to the plan of redemption

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:41.039
and the price of redemption and the proof of redemption.

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:46.959
And he goes through and he just gives such powerful truth that is so precious to us today

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:51.239
to help us understand our position in Christ.

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:57.379
And I'm so thankful to be a child of the King, to be saved, to be redeemed.

00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:02.059
We then look at the last three chapters of the book of Ephesians and we find that it's

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:07.859
here in these last few chapters that Paul is really saying to the believers at Ephesus,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:13.379
because of your position, this is how you should behave.

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:18.299
The behavior that is detailed in chapters four, five and six of the book of Ephesians

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:26.799
is not how to be saved or how to stay saved, it's the way that we live because we are saved.

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.639
And that's what Paul deals with in this great book.

00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:30.399
I mentioned this morning about the roses.

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:33.519
Somebody came in this morning and said, or this evening, and said, what roses are you

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.279
talking about, pastor?

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:36.959
And they said, are they white?

00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:39.519
I said, no, they're pink or red and they're over here.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:42.679
And I showed them this, oh, they are, they're so beautiful.

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:48.919
But those roses, as I mentioned this morning, are the fruit, those roses are the evidence

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:52.039
of life, right?

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:54.279
They prove that there's life.

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:58.199
The roots are providing the sustenance and the fruit is that rose.

00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:02.359
And so we find that as we come to Ephesians four, five and six, and looking here in chapter

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:09.639
number five, that this is written to believers and saying to these believers that because

00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:13.919
you're saved, because we've established your position in Christ, this is how you should

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:15.839
live your life.

00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:23.639
Notice in Ephesians five and verse number eight, he says, for ye were sometimes darkness.

00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:26.839
See, we were dead in our sins and our trespasses.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:30.459
We were in darkness, amen?

00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:35.919
But notice the next words, but now, but now, why?

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:36.919
Because they had been saved.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:37.919
They had been converted.

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.839
They had been redeemed.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:45.559
He says, but now are ye light in the Lord.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:51.479
And then notice what he tells them to do, walk as children of light.

00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:53.359
Walk as children of light.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:58.320
And so we notice that in the book of Ephesians, there are a number of references with regard

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.679
to our walk in chapters four, five and six.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:05.760
And as we look at this particular one here in five, eight, we find that he says that

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.919
we're to walk as children of light.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:14.639
There's a distinct difference between a child of darkness and a child of light, amen?

00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:18.639
We find that it was in Ephesians two, I read the portion this morning, but you find there

00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:24.199
was an Ephesians two, but he talked about the fact that we were fulfilling the desires

00:19:24.199 --> 00:19:26.119
of the flesh and of the mind.

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:31.639
You understand the desires of the flesh are quite different than the desires of the spirit.

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:36.559
And you understand that walking as a child of darkness is drastically different than

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.399
walking as a child of light.

00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:42.959
And so Jesus says to his disciples, ye are the light of the world.

00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:47.760
For us, as we look to the book of Ephesians, we find that Paul now says to these believers

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:54.519
in Ephesus that ye are, because you've been redeemed now, though you were in darkness,

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:55.599
you've been redeemed.

00:19:55.599 --> 00:20:00.479
And so now ye are light in the Lord, therefore walk as children of light.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:05.819
light. Notice in the book of Philippians in chapter number 2, writing to another

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:10.199
group of believers, the church at Philippi, we find here in Philippians

00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:15.359
chapter number 2 that Paul is encouraging these believers with regard

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:20.439
to their role as being the light of the world. In Philippians 2 in verse number

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:26.799
15, notice what he says, that ye may be blameless and harmless. Notice what he

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:33.819
says, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse

00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:42.459
nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Oh yeah, we're in the midst of

00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:48.459
a crooked and perverse nation, are we not? I do not need to spend any time this

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:53.579
evening to prove that point. I believe that we each here tonight, just by

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:56.699
knowing a little bit of what's going on in our society, in our culture, we would

00:20:56.699 --> 00:21:00.819
readily acknowledge that we are living in the midst of a crooked and perverse

00:21:00.819 --> 00:21:06.179
nation. If you're not sure on that, see me afterwards and I'll help you. But the

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:11.739
reality is that I want you to see the focus here that Paul says even though

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:16.419
you're in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, or maybe I should say it

00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:21.939
this way, not even though you are, but because you are, you're to shine as

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:29.179
lights in the world. You're to shine as lights in the world. See this evening as we

00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:33.699
understand this truth from Matthew chapter number five when Jesus says to

00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:37.979
the disciples, ye are the light of the world, and then he says let your light so

00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:44.779
shine before men, we'd understand number one that we have a role. You have a role.

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:49.459
He didn't ask you if you want it to be the light of the world. He simply told

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:55.379
you that you are the light of the world. Number two, I would say this, we have a

00:21:55.379 --> 00:22:04.179
region. We have a region, an area, a sphere of influence, a place in which we let our

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:10.179
light shine. What I mean by that is that when we come here collectively as a

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:17.299
group of believers, as a body of saints that assemble in this particular church,

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:21.779
we all come together within this building that God has graciously blessed

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:26.179
us with, but then we leave this place, and as we leave this place, you have a

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:33.539
region, you have an area, you have a place where you are to shine as a light. And we

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:38.019
understand this evening that even as we would illustrate it with our map over

00:22:38.019 --> 00:22:42.019
here, and as we would think about the particular missionaries going to

00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:46.579
particular regions, one of the reasons specifically that I asked Brother Cook

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:51.619
to put on there a button that would light up every one of those lights at

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:56.099
the same time is really a twofold purpose. Number one, so that we could see

00:22:56.099 --> 00:23:00.899
where we have representation, but number two, so that we can see where we do not

00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:09.619
have representation. See, because there are some places that are represented on

00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:12.979
that map where we have, sometimes we have multiple missionaries in the same

00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:15.779
country, and that's not a bad thing. It's not to say that, well, that missionary

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:19.619
or that country has one missionary they don't need anymore. I would never suggest

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:24.739
that. What I'm saying is that there are some regions that don't have any light.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:31.939
And so when we think about this truth of having a role but then having a region,

00:23:31.939 --> 00:23:35.699
there are places in which you go that I don't go. There's a sphere of influence

00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:38.499
that you have that I don't have. There's a sphere of influence that I have that

00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:42.899
you don't have. I mentioned all of those lighthouses a moment ago, and the

00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:46.979
distances in which they shine. You think about the roles and responsibilities of

00:23:46.979 --> 00:23:50.339
the lighthouse keeper, and you go through that whole process, but you understand

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:57.139
that they're placed where they are to shine in that region. The lighthouse in

00:23:57.139 --> 00:24:02.339
Hatteras isn't going to help a sailor in Rhode Island or, excuse me, in

00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:07.779
Connecticut or wherever up north, right? Maine. It's not going to help them. So

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:11.219
there's got to be a lighthouse there. In fact, if you travel the eastern seaboard,

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:15.859
you'll have the opportunity to see scores of lighthouses. Why? Because along

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:20.019
the eastern seaboard, there were a lot of people that were traveling by ship back

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:25.379
in the day coming to this country, and as they would come, they would need to have

00:24:25.379 --> 00:24:31.459
help with the terrain as they would navigate those waters. And so that

00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:36.019
lighthouse has a particular region. It has a particular area in which it is to

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:41.219
serve, in which it is to provide those navigators, those sailors, with the

00:24:41.219 --> 00:24:45.459
information that were needed. In fact, we would find that as we think about this

00:24:45.459 --> 00:24:49.539
truth that we have a region, we'd be mindful of the disciples. Go to Acts 8, if

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:53.219
you will, and I want you to see what the Word of God says about the disciples

00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:57.139
here in Acts chapter number 8. Now, we're familiar with the fact that persecution

00:24:57.139 --> 00:25:02.179
began for the first century saints right after the day of Pentecost, and

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:08.499
after they had the privilege of being able to see so many saved, of course the

00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:14.099
enemy was ready to attack and ready to cause all sorts of problems, and the

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:18.099
persecution began, the disciples were threatened, they were beaten, they were

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:22.499
imprisoned, and all sorts of things took place. But we find that Jesus had given

00:25:22.499 --> 00:25:28.419
the responsibility to His disciples, His followers, to go into all the world and

00:25:28.499 --> 00:25:33.299
preach the gospel to every creature. In Acts, the Bible records it for us in Acts

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:38.099
1 and verse number 8, He says, after you receive power that you're to go, and He

00:25:38.099 --> 00:25:42.019
tells them that as they would go in the power of the Holy Spirit, that they were

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:45.939
to go to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part. They weren't supposed

00:25:45.939 --> 00:25:51.139
to just stay in Jerusalem. We find that here in Acts chapter number 8, the

00:25:51.139 --> 00:25:56.339
persecution against the church that was there in Jerusalem began to intensify,

00:25:56.339 --> 00:26:00.179
and really, as you look at the way in which it was intensifying, you find in

00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:04.579
verse number 3, the Bible says that as for Saul, he made havoc of the church,

00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:09.779
entering into every house and hailing men and women, committed them to prison.

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:15.699
You see the persecution. But I want you to notice verse number 4. It says,

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:22.659
therefore, they that were scattered abroad went, what are those next words,

00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:30.339
everywhere preaching the word. So effectively, you know what happened here

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:34.339
in Acts chapter number 8? All of those lights that were in Jerusalem, those

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:39.699
individual believers, right? You're the light of the world. We're using that this

00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:42.899
evening. We're understanding that truth. And so all of those believers that are

00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:46.819
individually, you're the light of the world, they were there in Jerusalem, and

00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:50.979
they were scattered abroad because of the persecution, and they went from

00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:56.499
Jerusalem, and they went out, and they went everywhere preaching the word,

00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:01.139
the particular region in which they were going to. And we find that here it says

00:27:01.139 --> 00:27:05.299
in verse number 5, then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached

00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:09.059
Christ unto them. The Bible tells us that there was great joy in that city in

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:12.259
verse number 8. Why? Because the gospel came. People were getting saved. I mean,

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:17.299
how wonderful and amazing this is. But we find that as some commentators have

00:27:17.299 --> 00:27:23.139
said, theologians of yesteryear, that Satan, the enemy, sought to stamp out the

00:27:23.139 --> 00:27:27.539
fire of the church in Jerusalem, and all that happened where the embers were

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:33.379
spread across the globe. And really, that's what happened. Remember in just a

00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:36.579
few chapters into some of the missionary journeys here in the book of Acts, you'll

00:27:36.579 --> 00:27:42.179
find that they say of Paul that these have come here also that have turned the

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:47.299
world upside down because they went everywhere preaching the word. So we

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:50.979
understand this evening that we have a region. Look at Romans chapter number 15,

00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:54.659
if you will. Romans chapter 15. Notice what Paul says here.

00:27:57.539 --> 00:28:05.859
Paul's sharing here with these believers some truth with regard to his ministry

00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:10.419
and that which the Lord had called him to. But I want you to notice specifically

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:16.099
what he says here in Romans 15 verses 19 and 20. He says this,

00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:19.539
"...through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God,

00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:28.659
so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel

00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:36.579
of Christ. Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named,

00:28:37.139 --> 00:28:42.099
lest I should build upon another man's foundation." So in other words, Paul didn't

00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:48.899
want to go pull up into this new town or this town where the gospel was and plant a church

00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:55.139
right next door to a church that was already there preaching the gospel. We've often talked

00:28:55.139 --> 00:29:01.779
about, I had a man call me a number of years ago, I don't remember exactly the year, I think

00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:08.659
it was 2013, and he got my name somehow. There was some contact that knew me and knew this guy.

00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:13.619
I didn't know the guy, but he gave me my name and he knew that we're living in Manassas at the time

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:17.619
and knew that I pastored here in Oakton. He calls me all excited and tells me how he wants to

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:22.179
pastor a church in Manassas. And he's going to go to Manassas and start a church. I said,

00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:26.899
man, I think that's wonderful. I said, but here's a list of pastors in Manassas that are faithfully

00:29:26.899 --> 00:29:31.459
preaching the gospel and I would recommend that you contact them. And also there are two churches

00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:36.339
in Manassas that I know of that don't have pastors. Perhaps you'd like to check one of those

00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:40.579
out. I wasn't trying to discourage the man from starting a church in Manassas if that's what God

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:45.380
wanted him to do, but I was simply trying to help him understand that there were some churches

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:51.619
already in Manassas doing what they're supposed to do. And yet we have other regions in America

00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:57.459
where there are no churches. And so it's just a matter of understanding logistically where we are

00:29:57.459 --> 00:30:00.260
and who's here and who's not here and how many.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.380
people are preaching the gospel and what have you, and so you understand here that

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.900
Paul was saying that he went from Jerusalem into Illyricum and that he

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.860
fully preached the gospel, but you see his heart and his mind was that he

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.460
wanted to go where Christ was not named, lest he should build upon another

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.060
man's foundation. And you think about the Apostle Paul and you think about his

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.940
missionary journeys and you understand as he would go and be just a pioneer, if

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.820
you will, and I understand some people aren't pioneers and they're not up for

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.420
all of that, but you understand that Paul went and he preached the gospel and

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:39.220
people were saved and it was amazing what God did in and through him. And this

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:46.300
evening, we understand that we have a region, you have an area. See, when we think

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:51.540
about this teaching that Jesus gave to the disciples in Matthew chapter number

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:58.060
five, and he says you're the light of the world, and we understand that he would

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:05.060
through the course of history, that he would allow the gospel to go around the

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:12.220
globe through individual believers, followers of Jesus Christ, understanding

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.620
and embracing their role that they are the light of the world. Understanding it

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:24.340
and saying, that's my job, that's my role, that's my responsibility. And they would

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.580
find that there was a particular region in which they were placed or located and

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:33.020
they would say this is where I'm going to serve God and be a light. You hear all

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:38.380
the time people say various places are hard. And what they mean by that is

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.940
people, you know, there's a question that typically gets asked of

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.060
missionaries. Brother Jared, I'm sure that as you were traveling with your family

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.580
you probably heard your dad have this question asked a number of times, are the

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.260
people receptive to the gospel? It seems like everybody wants to ask a

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.060
missionary, are the people receptive to the gospel? And I understand the purpose of

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.460
asking the question, I understand the reasoning, the logic, what we're trying to

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:07.260
find out and discover, but you understand the gospel is confrontational. And you

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.740
understand that as you would go, and some people say, oh that's a hard area, do you

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:17.100
suggest that we don't need a light there because it's a hard area? Or perhaps we

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.300
need more of a light there because it's a hard area. You know what we've done in

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.620
America? If you do some some research, in fact there's a website, I don't even know

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.740
if it's still up and running, I haven't checked it in a number of years, but it

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.460
was called saltandlight.org, and on that particular website they would list

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.700
cities around the United States of America along with their population and

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.820
with the number of gospel preaching churches that were in those areas.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.900
You know what's an unfortunate reality in America is that gospel preaching

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:57.140
churches, by the just scores of them, left the cities years ago. Now you still can

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:03.060
find gospel preaching churches and cities, but lots of them left. And they

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.780
left the cities because it was hard, because it was dangerous, because it was

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:11.740
fill-in-the-blank, whatever it was. Brother Mershon, who many of you know, we

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.740
find that Deborah gave a testimony about Mrs. Mershon at the ladies meeting

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:20.860
there, and Brother Mershon tried for years to find someone that would go to

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.740
San Diego and plant a church. He offered to help him, he offered all sorts of

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.140
assistance to fill in and also go so many with him, so on and so forth, and it

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.940
was years and years and years before he could find somebody that was willing to

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.500
go to the city of San Diego to plant a church. In the city. Well, we're

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.620
outside the city and we reach into the city. No, no, get in the city and be a

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:50.540
light there. And so we find that God's plan through the course of history has

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:55.060
been that his people are the light of the world. And were to go to our

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.700
particular region for us here, it's northern Virginia. You know how many

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.420
people tell me over the years, I've been here for almost 10 years, I can't even

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.700
tell you how many times I've had somebody say to me, oh that's a hard area.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.260
People tell me that all the time. What does that mean? Does it mean that we just

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.180
say, well, you know, us four are no more, we're gonna just hold on until Jesus

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:24.660
comes back? No. This is where God's put us. Amen? And you're saying, I can't wait to

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.940
leave. I hope that's not your hard attitude. If God moves you, that's one

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.180
thing. But the reality is that God has placed us where he's placed us, and we're

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:40.020
the light in this area. And this area needs the light. Amen? I said this, you

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.900
have a role, we have a role, we have a region. And I would ask this question as

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:49.740
a final thought this evening. It's a very direct question, and is this, are you

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.100
fulfilling your responsibility? Am I fulfilling my responsibility?

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.940
Individually, are we fulfilling the responsibility that we have been given?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.260
Collectively, as a church, are we fulfilling the responsibility that we

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:13.700
have been given? This month is, apart from last year, has been the month in which

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:19.500
every year we've had our missions conference. We kind of have a, obviously,

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.140
missions emphasis year-round, but highlight and have as a big date on our

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.980
calendar in the month of May, a missions conference. And we've often understood,

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.420
and I've often preached over the years, that as we have the privilege of sending

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.260
missionaries all around the globe, we must understand that we are the

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:46.380
missionaries here in this community. The Bible says, as I referenced a moment ago,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.619
that truth in Acts 1 and verse number 8, and it's important to understand this, he

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:55.380
says, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.420
and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.180
Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. The idea, when he says that you

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.700
shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.339
uttermost, is really what he's saying is at the same time. And so we're giving of

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:19.940
our resources financially to send missionaries across the globe, and I'm so

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:28.420
thankful for that, and it's a privilege to be able to give to missions. We, as a

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.540
family, we give to missions regularly every month, missions giving, missions

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:39.220
giving. Why? Because I believe it's important. I believe God blesses it, and I

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:45.820
feel a great privilege to be able to support the work of missions. But you

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.339
understand that it's more than just putting missions dollars in the plate to

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:55.779
send a missionary to another country. It's you and it's me going across the

00:36:55.779 --> 00:37:02.740
street and being a missionary to our neighbor, being a missionary to the

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.860
region, right? We have a role, but we have a region, we have an area. There's a place

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:13.619
where God has planted us. There's a place in which God has given us a place to

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:19.300
dwell, a home. There's a place in which God has put us to work and to fulfill

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.500
that role. But we understand that God has us in that place, not just as fulfilling

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:30.900
a duty and obligation as a worker, but understanding that we're a light.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:36.779
And oh, we must be careful and creative as to how we would share the gospel with

00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:40.940
those that we come into contact with, and especially when we're on the job and

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.140
what have you, but what a great opportunity that God has given us. And we

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:53.460
understand this evening, this role in this region, but the question is how are

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:59.460
we doing with it? Are we fulfilling our responsibility? Are we letting our light

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:05.940
so shine? As Jesus gave this command to his disciples in Matthew chapter 5,

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:12.700
ye are the light of the world, verse 14, let your light so shine, verse 16. So if

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:19.300
this is what you are, this is what you do. A light shines. Amen? If you come in here,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.700
we have 50 light bulbs in these chandeliers, and it's amazing. I'm going to

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.540
make this statement, and this week I'll have to replace a light bulb, but it has

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.380
been weeks, excuse me, it's been months. I mean, it's probably been a year and a

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:38.580
half. I haven't had to replace one light bulb. Absolutely amazing. When I first got

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:44.380
here, I was changing light bulbs every week, 50 of them. Dean walked in, I'm

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.299
standing on top of the pew because I can reach him from standing on the pew. Why don't

00:38:47.299 --> 00:38:52.739
you have a ladder? Too much work, man. I got to just get this thing done. Don't

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:59.179
get nervous. I don't do it anymore. I'm getting old. But the reality is that when

00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:05.619
the light is out, what do we do with it? Why do we replace it? Because a light is

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:10.859
supposed to shine. Amen? And I'm not saying to you, I'm not suggesting that

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:15.700
God's going to get rid of us, but I'm saying that we need to shine.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:21.140
That's what we're called to do. Ye are the light of the world, let your light so

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:28.619
shine. What is it that would maybe prevent us from being the light that God

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:34.299
has called us to be or he's told us that we are? I think about those roles that I

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:38.780
mentioned of the lighthouse keeper and a couple of them in particular, the one of

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.979
cleaning the lenses and the windows, and I think about the way in which our

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:50.220
lens can become dirty. The way in which we can be affected and influenced by the

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.900
world. You think about this truth, turn to the book of James, if you will, chapter

00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:02.220
number one. James chapter number one. I want you to notice what is said here.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.400
Here in v. 27, really the end of the verse,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.280
we'll read the entirety of the verse,

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.520
but focus there with this thought

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.200
on how it is that our lens can become dirty

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.380
and our lens needs to be cleaned.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.100
It says in v. 27 of James 1,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.860
pure religion undefiled before God and the Father is this,

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.560
to visit the fatherless and widows

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.860
in their affliction,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:30.600
and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.060
To keep himself unspotted from the world.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.940
I don't wear glasses,

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.040
but I know some that wear glasses,

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.460
and I've actually wore some sunglasses recently,

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.840
and I put those sunglasses on,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.360
and I said, man, these lenses are filthy.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.740
They were dirty.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.780
I hadn't worn them in a long time.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.440
Man, they just had smudges all over them.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.300
It was hard to see through them.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.680
For those of you that wear glasses,

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.100
you understand it can be annoying

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.180
to have something on the lens.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.720
You want to clean that lens, right?

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.880
And so you think about us as the light of the world

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.320
and to let your light so shine.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.520
If we get spotted from the world,

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.880
maybe our light's not shining like it should.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.200
If that lighthouse that we mentioned in the beginning

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.700
there at Hatteras,

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.560
it's to shine 20 miles out to sea,

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.160
I would submit to you this evening

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.720
that if there's dirt and debris

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.520
and all sorts of things all over the lens

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.720
and all over the glass there,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.820
it's not going to shine as far.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.400
It's just not going to work.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.640
You ever had a headlight on your automobile

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.140
get frosted on the inside

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.200
and it doesn't shine like it's supposed to?

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.140
It needs to be clean.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.200
It needs to be taken care of

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.440
so that it will shine like it's designed to shine.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:52.100
Not only here, but notice in 1 John 3.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.940
In John 3,

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.420
and really, I believe, obviously,

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.060
the chapter divisions and verses were added later,

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.580
but really if you look at chapter 2 and verse 28

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.860
all the way down through chapter 3 and verse number 3,

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.460
it's just a great portion of Scripture

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.260
with regard to the coming of Christ.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.660
And let's read that entirety

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.340
beginning in verse 28 of 1 John 2.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:14.860
It says,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.460
And now little children abide in Him,

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.580
that when He shall appear,

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.580
we may have confidence

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.260
and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.460
If you know that He is righteous,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.180
so that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.980
is born of Him,

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.020
behold, what manner of love

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.740
the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.220
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.540
Therefore the world knoweth us not,

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.940
because it knew Him not.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.300
Beloved, now are we the sons of God,

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.700
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.180
but we know that when He shall appear,

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.780
we shall be like Him,

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.940
for we shall see Him as He is.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.700
And every man that hath this hope in him..."

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.500
That's what it says.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.180
"...purifies himself even as he is pure."

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.700
Desiring to stay clean.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.460
Desiring to live right.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.460
To walk as children of light

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.140
as Paul said there in Ephesians 5

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.740
in verse number 8.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.740
We understand that we go

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.300
in the power of the Holy Spirit

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.300
filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.060
We talked about the role

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.660
of the lighthouse keeper

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.180
to replenish the fuel.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.540
The reality is that we understand

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.980
that we can grieve and quench

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.020
the Holy Spirit of God.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.940
The children of Israel were said of this

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.660
in Psalm 78 that the Bible says

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.580
that they limited the Holy One of Israel.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.060
Have you ever considered

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.900
how the limitless God can be limited?

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.780
That's what the Bible says.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.540
The children of Israel,

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.180
they limited the Holy One of Israel.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.540
How? Because of their unbelief.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.180
Their doubt.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.060
We think this evening

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.540
of the way in which we would be filled

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.460
with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.660
Not quenching the Spirit.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.260
Not grieving the Spirit.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.540
Walking in the Spirit

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.900
and having the power of the Holy Spirit

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.780
that is mentioned in Acts chapter number 1

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.660
and verse number 8

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.860
that we'd be endued with that power

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.660
being filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.700
What a blessing as we go

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.860
in the power of God and shine

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.580
as lights in this dark world.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.540
I ask the question as our final point,

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.500
are you fulfilling your responsibility?

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.420
And I would say this

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.580
on a very positive note

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.820
that we'll use the example

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.180
of John the Baptist

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.900
and say that he fulfilled his responsibility.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.380
Turn to John 5 and verse number 35.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.180
John the Baptist is a man

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.780
in which had a powerful ministry,

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.980
a powerful impact.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.860
And I'm always and I say it

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.980
not very often, but regularly

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.020
I'll make the statement

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.780
from John 3 and verse 30.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.740
He must increase and I must decrease.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.060
And that's one of those statements

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.340
that John the Baptist makes

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.620
that just sticks with you.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.540
And it's so appropriate for us,

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.580
a motto, if you will, for our lives

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.060
that we'd understand that

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.260
even as Jesus said

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.700
in Matthew chapter number 5

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.700
and verse number 16,

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.180
let your light so shine before men

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.660
that they may see your good works

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.420
and do what glorify your father,

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.020
which is in heaven.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.940
It's not so that we could be acknowledged

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.060
or recognized and look

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.820
at what this person.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.500
No, it's so that Jesus

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.700
would be recognized and exalted

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.140
so that the Lord would receive

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.700
the glory that is due unto his name.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.780
And John said he must increase.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.340
I must decrease.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.100
But notice what Jesus says of John.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.420
John the Baptist, the Bible says this

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.340
in verse number 33,

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.020
it says he sent unto John

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.700
and he bear witness unto the truth.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.860
But I receive not testimony from man,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.300
but these things I say

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.580
that you might be saved.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.900
He, speaking of John the Baptist,

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.300
was a burning and a shining light.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.340
And you're willing for a season

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.940
to rejoice in his light.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.820
I just want you to think about

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.780
that first phrase of verse number 35

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.780
and how the Lord Jesus Christ

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.740
described John the Baptist.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.580
A burning and a shining light.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.060
And I want to be described that way.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.500
A burning and a shining light.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.540
This morning we spoke about Phoebe,

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.260
our sister.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.220
We spoke about the particular qualities

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.660
or observations that we made of

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.140
of this servant of the Lord.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.180
She was converted and she was committed

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.500
and she was compassionate.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.020
But the verse started with,

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.020
I commend unto you, Phoebe, our sister,

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.340
and I said that she was commended by Paul.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.460
I mean, how wonderful

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.340
that Paul would rank that

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.100
under the inspiration

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.060
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.820
But we look here that God in flesh,

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.900
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.700
when speaking about John the Baptist,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.020
he says of him

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.460
that he was a burning

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.180
and a shining light.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.060
Did John the Baptist

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.020
have an easy ministry?

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.300
No.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.500
I mean, did everyone like him?

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.660
Say, man, come on over here,

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.460
let's John the Baptist.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.700
No, he was beheaded.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.300
Right, and that's what happened.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.500
But Jesus said he was a burning

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.060
and a shining light.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.820
Oh, this evening,

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.580
this familiar passage of scripture

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.460
in Matthew five,

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.980
you're the light of the world.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.580
It's a familiar passage.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.220
We sing about it.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.260
But I wonder this evening.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.460
How are we doing on

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.140
fulfilling the responsibility?

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.300
See, I made the statement

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.300
a few times already,

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.180
but Jesus didn't say

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.740
but Jesus didn't ask the disciples,

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.260
would you like to be

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.020
the light of the world?

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.100
He simply said to the disciples,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.660
ye are the light of the world.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.540
And as such,

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.980
we need to walk as children of light

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.380
in the midst of a crooked

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.900
and perverse generation.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.620
We shine as lights.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.860
And what a great privilege

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.860
and opportunity that we have

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.980
in this dark, dark day

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.780
to shine as lights.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.580
Because we are the children of light.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.100
Let's pray, Father.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.180
This evening, we've looked

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.340
at a familiar passage.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.100
But I pray that we've examined it

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.180
with fresh eyes and a fresh heart.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.380
That we would.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.620
Have an honest evaluation.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.180
Of this role that has been assigned

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.660
to us as your children.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.300
As we honestly evaluate our lives.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:45.900
That we would.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.700
Desire to have that testimony

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.980
that John the Baptist had

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.340
of being a burning and shining light.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.180
God, we cannot do it on our own,

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.540
we readily acknowledge that we need you.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.940
I pray that you'd help us

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.100
to be emptied of self.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.380
Filled with thy spirit.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.300
As we leave this place

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.420
and enter into our region this week.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.260
Would you help us to be mindful of our role?

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.620
Fulfill our responsibility.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.740
We'll give you the glory

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.540
for all that you'll do.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.020
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.220
Would you stand with us?
