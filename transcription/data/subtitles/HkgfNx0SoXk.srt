1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Thessalonians chapter number 2 1st Thessalonians chapter number 2 will be looking at verses 1 through 9 this morning

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,960
1st Thessalonians 2 verses 1 through 9

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,100
What wonderful song service we have enjoyed it's been good to be here. We've been blessed

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,959
I believe the Lord already has been worshipped and has been pleased

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,719
We begin with Jesus saves what a wonderful

6
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:29,079
Declaration a wonderful anthem of God's people and look to the Lamb of God

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:36,040
Oh what a message we need to proclaim that Jesus saves look to the Lamb of God, and then I surrender all I

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,240
believe as we look here even in 1st Thessalonians 2 verses 1 through 9 and obviously

9
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:47,560
Part of the focus will be on the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul actually most of the message

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,599
Will be about the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul and of course those that served along with him

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,580
but we think about the

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,340
The song I surrender all I believe that one of the greatest

13
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,720
examples of full surrender in all of the scriptures is the Apostle Paul and

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,360
He said I am crucified with Christ in Galatians 2 in verse number 20

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,080
He said in Philippians 1 in verse number 21 for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,040
I believe that the Apostle Paul is a wonderful example of a life that was fully surrendered to the Lord

17
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:26,959
No, no wonder that God used him in the way that he did

18
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,919
Oftentimes we look at people that God has used in a great way and maybe

19
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,839
We mistake the the situation we say well, I don't have those abilities or those opportunities

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,699
No, no

21
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:43,800
It's God working through us and it's simply a surrendered clean vessel

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,559
That God uses and as we look at the passage of Scripture this morning

23
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:54,400
We understand here that the Apostle Paul is writing to the believers in Thessalonica

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,559
The work in the city of Thessalonica took place during the second missionary journey

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,000
we often as we read the book of Acts and we read the

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,320
The start of the church and all that God accomplished in the first century through his disciples

27
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:17,800
We find that we begin dealing with the first second and third missionary journeys of the Apostle Paul

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,320
the work in Thessalonica took place during his second missionary journey and if you were to read about the brief time that

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,740
They had ministering in the city of Thessalonica. You would read that in Acts 17

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,240
Verses 1 through 10 and as we begin to look at the passage of Scripture there in Acts 17

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Not that we're gonna focus on it this morning

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,919
We would conclude that it was a very short period of time in which the Apostle Paul

33
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,679
ministered in the city of Thessalonica

34
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:51,460
In fact, it most Bible scholars as you read the passage of Scripture

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,600
It says that he reasoned with them for three Sabbaths. And so you would conclude that he was there just for about three weeks

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,860
Out of the Scriptures he it says for three Sabbath days

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,559
Reasoned with them out of the Scriptures in Acts 17 in verse number two

38
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,559
And then of course we know

39
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,679
Just as it had been the case in other cities that the Apostle Paul ministered

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,039
There was a group of people that opposed the work of God

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,100
By the way, it is nothing new that the work of God would be opposed. It's been that way

42
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,800
Since the beginning we have an enemy

43
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,839
The devil he's a roaring lion. He walketh about seeking whom he may devour

44
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,199
He seeks to discourage by the way

45
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,259
One of his greatest weapons is that of fear and oh how we're living in such a fearful

46
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:42,720
Society today and we find here that the Apostle Paul was ministering and those ministering alongside

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,759
Him and of course the opposition rose up and eventually

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,759
Paul and Silas left they they departed from Thessalonica

49
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,320
they went to Berea and then you begin to read about the situation there with acts with Athens and

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,119
Paul looking at the city that was wholly given to idolatry and we look at those things and we see how that God used Paul

51
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,119
and Silas and Timothy there in

52
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:13,600
Thessalonica we have the opportunity as we come to this first

53
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:20,920
Epistle that Paul wrote back to these believers. Of course, he wrote first and second Thessalonians two different letters

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,799
That were sent to them. But as we read the the second chapter, especially these first nine verses

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,279
First Thessalonians, we are provided with a record of Paul's days of ministry again

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Not a very lengthy ministry, but God gives us some further insight to the ministry in Thessalonica

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,119
Now we would be quick to identify that there's no perfect church

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,399
Amen, there's no perfect church because there's no perfect people and some people say I'm looking for a perfect church

59
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,839
Well, you'll ruin it if you ever found it because you're not perfect. Amen, and there's no perfect church

60
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:03,079
there's no perfect pastor, but we are thankful that we have a perfect book and we have a perfect God and

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,399
We seek to serve him and to obey him

62
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,480
So the church in Thessalonica is not a perfect church

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,320
But we would say that the church in Thessalonica is a model church

64
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,839
in fact in the first chapter of the book of first Thessalonians

65
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,079
You find that the Apostle Paul is commending the believers in Thessalonica

66
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:29,839
He gives his introduction and his greetings and he begins to commend them for their work and what a blessing

67
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,399
to understand that these believers

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
understood their

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,040
Responsibility to take the gospel themselves

70
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,880
The gospel had been brought to them by the Apostle Paul and Timothy and Silas during that second missionary journey

71
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,239
But they understood that they had

72
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,160
Individual

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,079
responsibility to then take that same message and

74
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,559
Deliver it to others and Paul says this in verse number 8 of chapter 1 for from you

75
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,679
Sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia

76
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:13,040
But also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad so that we need not to speak

77
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,399
anything

78
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,279
Every time I read first Thessalonians and I see

79
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,399
What Paul is saying and how he is commending them for their outreach

80
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,440
According to verse number 8 it causes me to rejoice greatly

81
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,239
We find that he had said to them that they were in

82
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
examples and samples to all that believe in Macedonia and

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,239
Achaia

84
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:39,040
It's an interesting thing where Paul says so that we need not to speak anything

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,839
It's almost in my sanctified imagination in my mind's eye

86
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,440
I see the Apostle Paul going to a region and seeking to share the gospel and they say oh, yeah

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,959
We've already received that we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ the believers from Thessalonica

88
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,000
There's some folks that came over here and they shared the gospel. What a joy. What a blessing

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,799
I remember a number of years ago. It's happened on multiple occasions

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,760
But a number of years ago. I went into the post office to drop off some things and I actually wasn't at the Oakton post

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,880
Office that's the closest one to the church here, but I was over at the Fairfax

92
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:16,160
Post office the one over by the courthouse and I was there and I went in and I stood in line and was

93
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,480
waiting to do my transaction and I got up to the

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,799
Particular employee that would help me and I went through the process and at the end

95
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,600
I

96
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,079
Asked if I could share a gospel tract with this individual and told them about the content and so on and so forth and they

97
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,679
Said actually I just got one just a little while ago

98
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,320
Not only did I get one of those but I got one of these as well and he took out a John and Romans from

99
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,579
Our church and a gospel tract from our church and said somebody was here earlier today and just gave me this and I said

100
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,100
Praise the Lord. Amen. That's what it's about. Amen, and we see that the church in Thessalonica the believers there

101
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,359
They're commended for their work as we focus upon the the passage first Thessalonians 2 verses 1 through 9

102
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:05,700
If you're taking notes the message title this morning is this a passion to reach the lost a passion

103
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,779
To reach the lost we sing songs. We sang wonderful songs this morning about the

104
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,859
Proclamation of the gospel. In fact, there's a song in our hymnal that I cherish a passion for souls

105
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:23,859
Give me Lord a passion for souls a desire a passion to reach the lost

106
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:30,380
And we find that the the wonderful special that we heard just a few moments ago. I am not ashamed

107
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,739
to proclaim the gospel to to stand up and to

108
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,659
identify with the Lord Jesus Christ and we find in this passage of Scripture a

109
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,340
Passion to reach the lost notice in verse number one of first Thessalonians 2 the Bible says for yourselves brethren

110
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,520
Know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,219
Can I tell you every time that we go and share the gospel with anyone? It's never in vain

112
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,799
Never you say it was they didn't listen if you were able to quote some Bible verses the Holy Spirit of God can work

113
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:12,940
Sometimes we leave and we are discouraged. We're human beings and we say maybe I didn't say it, right?

114
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,619
Maybe I didn't package it, right?

115
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:22,940
Listen, if we just give the Bible we're giving God the opportunity to work and we're allowing the Holy Spirit of God to use

116
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,900
the Scriptures in the heart of those individuals

117
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,659
Someone said this you could never deliver the gospel to the wrong address. I like that and

118
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,380
That's a good truth and we find in verse number two

119
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,619
But even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as you know at Philippi

120
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,979
We were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God

121
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,059
With much contention for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile

122
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:00,140
But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel even so

123
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,400
And so we speak, not as pleasing men,

124
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,840
but God, which trieth our hearts.

125
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,280
For neither at any time

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,760
used we flattering words, as you know,

127
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,040
nor a cloak of covetousness.

128
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
God is witness.

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
Nor of men sought we glory,

130
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,520
neither of you nor yet of others,

131
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
when we might have been burdensome

132
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
as the apostles of Christ,

133
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,560
but we were gentle among you,

134
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,400
even as a nurse cherisheth her children.

135
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,440
And being affectionately desirous of you,

136
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,840
we were willing to have imparted unto you

137
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,440
not the Gospel of God only,

138
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,800
but also our own souls.

139
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,520
Why? Because you were dear unto us.

140
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
For you remember, brethren,

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
our labor and travail

142
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,280
for laboring night and day

143
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,880
because we would not be chargeable unto any of you,

144
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,840
we preached unto you the Gospel of God.

145
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,640
What a powerful passage of Scripture.

146
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,280
What great insight that God is giving us

147
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
with regard to the ministry

148
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,680
there in Thessalonica.

149
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
And I rejoice in what we read here

150
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,640
and how we can understand

151
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,960
as we look at these nine verses of Scripture

152
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,600
and it's rehearsed to us,

153
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
the way in which Paul and Silas and Timothy,

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,440
how they arrived there to Thessalonica

155
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
and how God used them

156
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,960
and what their manner was, if you will.

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,880
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

158
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,440
I want you to consider just a few things

159
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
with me this morning.

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,520
Number one, consider his mindset.

161
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,400
In the first few verses of this passage of Scripture,

162
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,080
I believe that we begin to have

163
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,680
an understanding of Paul's mindset.

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
I believe that his mindset

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
was a result of his perspective.

166
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,800
And we find that he says this

167
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
in verse 1 that it was not in vain.

168
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
I spoke of that already.

169
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
Notice in verse 2,

170
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,240
but even after that we had suffered before.

171
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,880
What's he speaking of?

172
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,440
Well, during the first missionary journey,

173
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
you remember they suffered.

174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,440
They dealt with all sorts of things

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,640
as they went into the region of Galatia,

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,040
Lystra, Iconium, Antioch and Pisidia and Derbe.

177
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
They went to those four places

178
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,840
and they preached the gospel.

179
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,960
And I mean, they suffered in each location.

180
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,800
They dealt with opposition.

181
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,920
Now, when they start that second missionary journey,

182
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
he references about the difficulties

183
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,600
that they suffered in Philippi.

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,240
But notice what he says,

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
even though they had suffered before,

186
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
they were shamefully entreated.

187
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
He says this,

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,280
we were bold in our God

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,000
to speak unto you the gospel of God

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,120
with much contention.

191
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
Well, that action, that behavior

192
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
is the result of a mindset

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,120
that the Apostle Paul had,

194
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,080
a perspective of some important things

195
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,640
that we find not only here in 1 Thessalonians,

196
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,080
but in other portions of the word of God.

197
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,560
Notice he says,

198
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,880
at the beginning of verse number four,

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,160
notice this phrase,

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,600
but as we were allowed of God

201
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,760
to be put in trust with the gospel,

202
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
even so we speak.

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,400
Oh, I hope that we'd allow the words

204
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
of verse number four

205
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,840
to really permeate our minds this morning.

206
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
So we see the minds of the Apostle Paul.

207
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,720
He says we were allowed of God.

208
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
What a privilege.

209
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,760
We often speak about the responsibility

210
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,720
that we have to proclaim the gospel.

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,040
And we do, we have a responsibility.

212
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,320
We often speak about the opportunity.

213
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,000
And oh, there are opportunities that God gives.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,280
In fact, I was speaking with someone yesterday,

215
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,560
and they asked me what I did,

216
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,880
and they asked if I did so-and-so, whatever.

217
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,640
And I said, no, actually I'm a pastor of a church,

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,920
and so on and so forth.

219
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,680
And we began to chat for just a moment.

220
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,800
And he said this to me.

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
He said, so what's the word for tomorrow?

222
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,560
And I began to just give him some information

223
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
about what I was preaching this morning.

224
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,440
He got a free preview.

225
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,360
And I told him, hey, you can join us online

226
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,640
as almost everyone's joining us online these days.

227
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,720
But I told him he could join us online.

228
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,520
But it was an opportunity to be able to share truth.

229
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,000
We have a responsibility.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
God gives us opportunities.

231
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,840
But you know, it's a privilege.

232
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,360
Paul says we were allowed of God,

233
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,240
notice, to be put in trust with the gospel,

234
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,920
even so we speak.

235
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,960
What a privilege to speak the gospel,

236
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,400
to proclaim the truth that Jesus saves.

237
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,920
We find that he says that we are put in trust

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
with the gospel.

239
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,320
You know, we've been entrusted

240
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,520
with the most important message

241
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,600
that could ever be delivered.

242
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,560
You think about in biblical times

243
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,480
and even in the early days of our nation

244
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,840
and years gone past,

245
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,400
it still occurs, I believe, in some levels today.

246
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,360
But if you have an important message to deliver,

247
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,280
remember the Bible talks about the faithful man

248
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,960
and the unfaithful man in the book of Proverbs.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,640
It talks about the unfaithful man as like a,

250
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,280
you know, he's got a foot out of joint,

251
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
a broken tooth and so on and so forth.

252
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,360
But if you have an important message

253
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,560
to deliver to someone,

254
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,120
and you can't be the one to deliver that message,

255
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
what do you do?

256
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,040
You entrust that to someone else.

257
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,760
You find somebody that's going to be faithful.

258
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
You find somebody that's going to go

259
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
and deliver that message.

260
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,720
And we find that Paul says that we were put in trust

261
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,640
with what?

262
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,000
With the gospel.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,080
He declared in 1 Corinthians 15

264
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
what the gospel is.

265
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,160
The gospel is the death, burial,

266
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

267
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,400
Often, we say the gospel is the good news.

268
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
Why?

269
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Because it is good news.

270
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,680
Jesus saves.

271
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,240
Jesus saves.

272
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,960
The minds of the apostle Paul

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,520
is what we're considering here.

274
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,000
And we see that it's a result of his perspective.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,920
I believe that the apostle Paul understood,

276
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,280
number one, the reality of eternity.

277
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,400
I believe the apostle Paul

278
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
had this understanding of eternity.

279
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,720
Sometimes we get so caught up in the temporal.

280
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,080
Sometimes things in this earth

281
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,600
or in our lives can be so overwhelming

282
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
and so in our face that we sometimes

283
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,520
lose sight of eternity.

284
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,880
We just get focused on the temporal.

285
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,440
What did he say in 2 Corinthians 4?

286
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Well, we look not at those things which are temporal,

287
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,280
but at those things which are eternal

288
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,480
in verse number 18 of 2 Corinthians 4.

289
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,320
We find that he understood the reality of eternity.

290
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I believe that he understood

291
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,560
the necessity of conversion.

292
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,960
See, those things go hand in hand.

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,080
If you understand the truth of eternity,

294
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,720
the reality of eternity,

295
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,800
you understand the necessity of conversion.

296
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,440
If you die without Christ,

297
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,960
if you've never been born again,

298
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Jesus said, except a man be born again,

299
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,360
he cannot see the Kingdom of God.

300
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,560
He says to Nicodemus,

301
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,960
you must be born again.

302
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,920
And we see the truth of conversion.

303
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,080
If any man be in Christ,

304
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,520
he's a new creature.

305
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,680
And what a joy to understand

306
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,720
old things are passed away.

307
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,160
Behold, all things are become new.

308
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,800
That transformation because of that conversion

309
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
of trusting Christ as our Savior.

310
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
I believe that the apostle Paul

311
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
understood the power of the Gospel.

312
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,880
Why did he say, they sang this morning,

313
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
I am not ashamed.

314
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Why, as we think about the truth

315
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,960
in Romans 1 and verse 16,

316
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I am not ashamed of the Gospel.

317
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,360
Why? Because it is the power of God

318
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
unto salvation.

319
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
He understood the power of the Gospel.

320
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,280
Sometimes we might forget

321
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,200
some of these things,

322
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
or they might not be

323
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
in the forefront of our minds,

324
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,240
and therefore, as we consider

325
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
the minds of the apostle Paul,

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
I believe that it would be helpful

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,040
for us to develop

328
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
and to adopt the same mindset.

329
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,760
Consider the words of the apostle Paul.

330
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm going to read a few passages

331
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
of Scripture to you.

332
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,560
Go to Romans 9 if you will.

333
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
I want you to look at two passages

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
here in the book of Romans,

335
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,320
and then we'll briefly look at a passage

336
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,200
in the book of 2 Corinthians.

337
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,520
In Romans 9, in verses 1-3,

338
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,200
notice here what the apostle Paul says.

339
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,360
He says, I say the truth in Christ,

340
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,000
I lie not,

341
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
my conscience also bearing me witness

342
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,400
in the Holy Ghost,

343
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,880
that I have great heaviness

344
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,560
and continual sorrow in my heart.

345
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
Why, Paul?

346
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
For I could wish that myself

347
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,040
were accursed from Christ

348
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,600
for my brethren,

349
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
my kinsmen according to the flesh.

350
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,040
Notice how he continues this same thought

351
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,480
in chapter 10 in verse 1.

352
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,720
Brethren, my heart's desire

353
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,680
and prayer to God for Israel

354
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,880
is that they might be saved.

355
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,119
See, why did Paul go on these missionary journeys?

356
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,799
Why did he go to these cities

357
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,679
and suffer the way that he suffered?

358
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
Why does he say to the believers

359
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
in Thessalonica,

360
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,920
even as he's writing about their entrance

361
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
there into the city

362
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
and their ministry there,

363
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,239
he says you know that we had suffered before.

364
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,559
He speaks about Philippi.

365
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,679
He talks about the fact that they were

366
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,480
dealing with contention even there

367
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,520
as they would preach and minister

368
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,559
in Thessalonica.

369
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,679
It says that at the end of verse 2,

370
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,480
to speak unto you the Gospel of God

371
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,040
with much contention.

372
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,400
And we find that yes,

373
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,160
they were run out of Thessalonica

374
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,440
just as they had been run out of previous cities.

375
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,720
We find that Paul says this is my heart's desire.

376
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,679
I want to preach the Gospel

377
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,640
because I understand eternity.

378
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,119
Because I understand the necessity of conversion.

379
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,920
I understand the power of the Gospel.

380
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,119
And I understand that people need to be saved.

381
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,119
Notice what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4.

382
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,359
I quoted part of verse 18 a moment ago.

383
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,359
Speaking about those things which are eternal

384
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,679
and not those things which are temporal.

385
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,320
But notice the first seven verses

386
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,559
of 2 Corinthians 4.

387
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,880
And this really gives a more complete picture

388
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,799
if you will,

389
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,080
of the mindset of the Apostle Paul.

390
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,400
It says this in verse number one.

391
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Therefore seeing we have this ministry

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,559
as we have received mercy,

393
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,880
we faint not.

394
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,239
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,

395
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,359
not walking in crap.

396
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,859
nor handling the word of God deceitfully,

397
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,859
but by manifestation of the truth,

398
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,359
commending ourselves to every man's conscience

399
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,859
in the sight of God."

400
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,659
By the way, what we see in verse 2

401
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,359
will be similar to what we begin to discover

402
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,659
in 1 Thessalonians 2, verses 5

403
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,859
down through really verse 7 and 8 there.

404
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,359
And we find that he continues and says this

405
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,859
in verse 3, notice,

406
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,359
"...but if our gospel be hid,

407
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,359
it is hid to them that are lost.

408
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,359
And whom the God of this world

409
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,359
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

410
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,859
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

411
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,859
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

412
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,859
For we preach not ourselves,

413
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,359
but Christ Jesus the Lord,

414
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,359
and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

415
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:56,359
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,

416
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,359
hath shined in our hearts

417
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,859
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

418
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,859
in the face of Jesus Christ.

419
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,359
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels

420
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,359
that the excellency of the power may be of God

421
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,359
and not of us."

422
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,359
What a mindset.

423
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,859
This morning, I hope that the truth of God's Word

424
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,359
would impact my life in such a way

425
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,859
that I would have a similar mindset

426
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,859
to what we see here of the Apostle Paul.

427
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,859
That we'd understand this responsibility

428
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,359
that he has given to us,

429
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,859
this privilege that is ours to proclaim.

430
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,859
Jesus saves. Jesus saves.

431
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,859
Not only do we consider his mindset,

432
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,359
consider his motive.

433
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,859
Very briefly, it's just kind of a brief point here,

434
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,359
but it's an important truth.

435
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,359
I don't want you to miss the truth

436
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,359
when we consider his motive.

437
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,359
It is possible that we, even as God's people,

438
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,359
can have wrong motives.

439
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,359
It is possible that as the people of God

440
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,859
that we could desire that someone would look at us

441
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,359
or think more highly of us,

442
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,359
that we would have an impure motive.

443
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,859
But I find with the Apostle Paul,

444
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,859
his motives are pure.

445
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,359
His motives are right.

446
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,359
I believe that really I could look at a two-fold motive.

447
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,359
Number one, to please the Lord.

448
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,859
And number two, to glorify the Lord.

449
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,859
Oh, that that would be the motive of our heart.

450
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:24,359
That when we go out and proclaim the Gospel,

451
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,859
that when we go and share the truth of the Gospel

452
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,859
with individuals that God would give us

453
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:30,359
the opportunity to,

454
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,359
that it would not be so that we could come

455
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,359
and stand up and say,

456
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,359
I did this, or I did that.

457
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,359
No, no, the Lord used us.

458
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,859
We're just vessels.

459
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,859
And how we ought to rejoice

460
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:47,859
that God would allow us.

461
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,359
That we would be allowed of God.

462
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,359
Remember, he said that in verse 4.

463
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,859
But notice what he says

464
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:55,359
as we look at the entirety of the fourth verse.

465
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,359
But as we were allowed of God

466
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,359
to be put in trust with the Gospel,

467
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,859
even so we speak, notice this,

468
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,859
not as pleasing men, but God.

469
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,359
Then he says this,

470
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,859
which trieth our hearts.

471
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,359
God knows what our motives are.

472
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,859
He knows if our motives are pure or right.

473
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,359
We understand, we quote often,

474
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,359
Jeremiah 17, 9 and 10,

475
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,859
dealing with the heart is deceitful

476
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,859
and desperately wicked.

477
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,859
Who can know it?

478
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,359
I, the Lord, try the heart.

479
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,859
We see that in Jeremiah 17.

480
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:27,359
We see that as Jesus is speaking

481
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,359
to the churches there in Asia

482
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,359
in the beginning of Revelation,

483
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,359
those seven churches of Asia,

484
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,359
he mentions there that I, the Lord,

485
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,359
try the heart.

486
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,359
He knows, Paul says,

487
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,359
which trieth our hearts.

488
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,359
See, Paul says there's no facade here.

489
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,359
I'm not seeking to please men.

490
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,359
I'm seeking to please God.

491
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,359
We can say it, but God knows it.

492
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,359
God knows if our motives are pure.

493
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,859
He knows why we sing.

494
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:57,359
He knows why I preach.

495
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,359
He knows why we give.

496
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,359
He knows why we,

497
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,359
whatever you want to say, God knows.

498
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,359
He knows our heart.

499
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,859
He knows our motive.

500
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,859
I believe that the Apostle Paul

501
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:10,859
sought to please the Lord with his life.

502
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,859
He, in fact, told Timothy

503
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,859
when he was speaking to Timothy

504
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,859
in 2 Timothy,

505
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,859
of course, the end of his life was nigh.

506
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,859
Paul was ready to be offered.

507
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,359
But he says this in verse 4 of chapter 2,

508
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,359
No man that woreth entangleth himself

509
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,859
with the affairs of this life,

510
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,859
that he may please him

511
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,359
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

512
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,859
Who chose us to be a soldier?

513
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:36,359
The Lord.

514
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,359
Paul encourages Timothy to please God.

515
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,359
Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter 1,

516
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,859
the Apostle Paul is writing to a carnal church.

517
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,359
Just as much as we would say of the church in Thessalonica

518
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,859
that it was a model church,

519
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,859
not so much for the church in Corinth.

520
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,359
I mean, it was a model church, if you will,

521
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,359
for what not to do or not how to behave.

522
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,359
There's certainly valuable lessons

523
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,359
that we learn from studying and reading

524
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,859
1 and 2 Corinthians

525
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:04,859
and understanding all of the divisions

526
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,859
and all that was going on there in Corinth.

527
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:08,859
And we've referenced some of those things

528
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,859
even as we've preached the book of Hebrews

529
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,359
and the immaturity of the believers in Corinth.

530
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,859
But notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 1.

531
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,859
Remember, these people are saying,

532
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:20,359
I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas, I'm of Apollos.

533
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,359
He'll tell them in chapter 3,

534
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,359
who then is Paul?

535
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,859
Who is Apollos?

536
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,359
It's God that giveth the increase.

537
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,359
We just are His servants.

538
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,859
But notice what he says in chapter 1 in verse 17,

539
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:35,359
For Christ sent me not to baptize,

540
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,359
but to preach the gospel,

541
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,859
not with wisdom of words,

542
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,359
lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

543
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,859
Notice verse 18.

544
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,859
He says this,

545
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,859
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness,

546
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:49,859
but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

547
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:51,859
We won't have the time to read the entirety

548
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,859
down all the way through verse 31.

549
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,859
Skip down, if you will, to verse 29.

550
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:56,859
He says this,

551
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,359
That no flesh should glory in His presence,

552
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,359
verse 31,

553
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,859
that according as it is written,

554
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,359
that glorieth let them glory in the Lord.

555
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,359
Paul's motive, I believe, was to please God.

556
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,359
To please the Lord.

557
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,359
Not only to please the Lord, but to glorify the Lord.

558
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,359
You know that Jesus said this prior to His departure,

559
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,859
when He already had informed the disciples.

560
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:22,359
Of course, you can already read about the time

561
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,359
in which He washed the feet of the disciples

562
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,859
there in chapter 13,

563
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,359
and He told them at the end,

564
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,859
He gave them that new commandment

565
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,359
that you love one another,

566
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,359
not that you would love as you love yourself,

567
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,359
but as Christ loved,

568
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,859
and gave them that new commandment.

569
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,359
It's the beginning of chapter 14,

570
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,859
where their hearts are troubled,

571
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:40,359
and He says,

572
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,359
Let not your heart be troubled.

573
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,859
And we get to chapter number 15,

574
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,859
and He begins to deal with the truth of the fact

575
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,359
that He is the vine and we're the branches.

576
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,359
And as you go through that passage of Scripture in John 15,

577
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,859
you find that what the Lord is teaching

578
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,359
is how that the husbandmen would come and prune

579
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,859
so that they would produce more fruit.

580
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:03,359
And He goes through that process,

581
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,359
and I want you to notice what Jesus says

582
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,359
in verse number 8 of John 15,

583
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,859
Herein is My Father glorified,

584
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,859
that ye bear much fruit,

585
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,359
so shall ye be My disciples.

586
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,859
The reality is that I believe

587
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:20,859
that as the Apostle Paul

588
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,859
would understand his responsibility

589
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,859
and his privilege to be able to preach the Gospel,

590
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,359
I believe that the Apostle Paul

591
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,859
is giving us his motive here.

592
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,359
He's telling these people,

593
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,359
listen, notice in verse number 5,

594
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,859
Neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know,

595
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,359
nor a cloak of covetousness.

596
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,859
Notice again, He says God is witness.

597
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,859
And He was not coming in, look,

598
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,859
nor of men, verse number 6,

599
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:52,359
sought we glory, neither of you.

600
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,359
They didn't go in there looking for glory.

601
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,359
They didn't go in there

602
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,359
so that someone would give them

603
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,359
some level of reverence.

604
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,859
In fact, you find that during his missionary journeys,

605
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,359
there was one time in which they wanted to worship Him, right?

606
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,359
They're in Derby.

607
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,859
They wanted to just worship Him.

608
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:08,859
And He says, no, no, no,

609
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,359
that's why I've come to give you

610
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,359
the truth of the living God.

611
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,859
They thought that He was one of the gods

612
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,859
that had come down.

613
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:17,859
And He says, no, no, no,

614
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,859
they were ready to bring worship

615
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,359
and make a sacrifice.

616
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,859
And Paul says, no way.

617
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:24,859
Worship the Lord.

618
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:25,859
And he says here,

619
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,859
nor of men sought we glory, neither of you,

620
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:31,359
nor yet of others.

621
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,859
We might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ.

622
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,859
See, Paul had this motive to please the Lord

623
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,859
and to glorify the Lord.

624
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:38,859
Pure motives.

625
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:39,859
Right motives.

626
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,859
God knows our motives.

627
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:42,859
We see His mindset.

628
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:43,859
We see His motive.

629
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,859
I want you to notice finally with me this morning,

630
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:49,359
consider His method.

631
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,859
As I begin to look at verses 5-9,

632
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:55,359
and begin to see how He gives us some insight

633
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,359
as to the actual approach

634
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,359
and the actual method of ministry

635
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,859
there in Thessalonica,

636
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,359
it refreshes my heart.

637
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,359
It encourages my heart.

638
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,859
It challenges me to consider our own methods

639
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:11,359
and to be sure of our own approach.

640
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,359
We understand as we look at verses 5-6

641
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,359
that there was a level of humility.

642
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,859
He says, neither any time usually flattering words,

643
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:20,859
you know,

644
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,359
nor a cloak of covetousness God has witnessed,

645
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,859
nor of men sought we glory,

646
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,359
neither of you, nor yet of others,

647
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,859
when we might have been burdensome

648
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,359
as the apostles of Christ.

649
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,359
Paul, as an apostle,

650
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,859
Paul, one that we often look to

651
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,859
and just look at as being a wonderful, godly Christian,

652
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,359
he enters in with a measure of humility.

653
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,359
Peter said that James said,

654
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,859
both of them said,

655
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,359
that we're to humble ourselves.

656
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,359
The reality is that Peter made this statement

657
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,359
that we're to be clothed with humility.

658
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,859
We humble ourselves.

659
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,359
You know, the greatest example

660
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,519
of humility is the Lord Jesus Christ.

661
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,779
God left the throne of heaven.

662
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,239
The Bible tells us in Philippians 2

663
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,479
about His humility.

664
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,399
It says this,

665
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,739
"...let this mind be in you,

666
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,359
which was also in Christ Jesus."

667
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,819
In Philippians 2 and verse 5,

668
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,359
"...who, being in the form of God,

669
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,439
thought it not robbery to be equal with God,

670
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,519
but made Himself of no reputation

671
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,399
and took upon Him the form of a servant

672
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,539
and was made in the likeness of men."

673
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,919
Being found in fashion as a man.

674
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,019
He humbled Himself

675
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:32,739
and became obedient unto death,

676
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,739
even the death of the cross.

677
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,499
It's interesting as Paul is writing

678
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,079
to the believers in Philippi

679
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,879
as he gives that great example

680
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,239
of the Lord Jesus Christ and His humility.

681
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,979
If you look at the verses that precede

682
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,279
that great declaration in v. 5-11,

683
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,799
you find that Paul says to them in v. 3,

684
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,399
"...let nothing be done

685
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,899
through strifer vainglory,

686
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,439
but in lowliness of mind,

687
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,779
in each esteem other better than themselves."

688
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,479
He's telling them about being servants

689
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,619
and about being humble,

690
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:04,679
and then he gives them the example of Christ.

691
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,739
See, Paul, when he entered into Thessalonica,

692
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:10,479
he entered with humility.

693
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,639
He had a powerful message to deliver.

694
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,259
He was an apostle.

695
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:17,459
He had a position. He had a title.

696
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,719
But he entered with humility.

697
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,959
And oh, how important it is

698
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:25,019
that we exercise humility,

699
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,919
that others see a measure of humility

700
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:29,519
in our approach.

701
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,899
We notice that he was gentle and caring.

702
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,299
V. 7, the Bible says,

703
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,239
"...but we were gentle among you,

704
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:42,379
even as a nurse cherisheth her children."

705
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:45,459
What a great picture, a word picture

706
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,299
that God gives us here

707
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,059
with regard to the method

708
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,539
or the approach of the apostle Paul

709
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,719
when they entered into Thessalonica.

710
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,539
He says, we were gentle among you.

711
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,939
He acted in the manner as a nurse

712
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:02,479
cherisheth her children.

713
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,239
What a great example.

714
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,319
We see the gentleness.

715
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,759
We see the level of care.

716
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,639
We see that they were gracious.

717
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,439
So being affectionately desirous of you,

718
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,439
we were willing to have imparted unto you

719
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,799
not the Gospel of God only,

720
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,699
but also our own selves

721
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:24,279
because you were dear unto us.

722
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,619
We see the faithfulness.

723
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,219
Notice in v. 9,

724
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,719
"...for you remember, brethren,

725
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,519
our labor and travail.

726
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,119
For laboring night and day,

727
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,659
because we would not be charitable unto any of you,

728
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,179
we preached unto you the Gospel of God."

729
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:42,939
When I think about the method,

730
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:45,139
the approach of the apostle Paul,

731
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,559
and we see these terms that are given,

732
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,299
we understand that they were bold.

733
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:50,939
If you go back to v. 2,

734
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,379
it says that we were bold in our God

735
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,359
to speak unto you the Gospel of God

736
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,559
with much contention.

737
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,319
You know that we can be bold and humble

738
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,679
at the same time.

739
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,959
We don't have to be harsh and brash and ugly.

740
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,079
I find that as I look and study

741
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,559
the book of 1 Thessalonians

742
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,159
and study the approach,

743
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,759
the method of the apostle Paul,

744
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,839
I would conclude that Paul

745
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,519
not only had the right position,

746
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,999
but he had the right disposition.

747
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,399
You know it's important to have the right disposition.

748
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,079
I mean, it's absolutely imperative

749
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,999
that we have the right position.

750
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:24,219
If you have the right position

751
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,419
and you're ugly about it

752
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:27,459
and you're down on somebody

753
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,539
and you're speaking down to them,

754
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,899
you're not going to be very successful

755
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:34,339
in sharing the message

756
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:37,059
that you're seeking to share.

757
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,939
We have that right disposition.

758
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,939
And we have that level of humility

759
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:44,059
and we're gentle and we're gracious

760
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,859
and caring and we're faithful.

761
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,099
And people understand,

762
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,619
listen, I've said this to people

763
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,819
in my own life,

764
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,739
listen, I'm not telling you the Gospel

765
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,759
because it's going to benefit me somehow.

766
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,039
I spoke with an individual,

767
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,719
I remember not long ago,

768
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,879
and they had been part

769
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,759
of other religious organizations

770
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,279
and other denominations, if you will,

771
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,439
that really had various,

772
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:08,399
and I'm just telling you what he told me.

773
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,839
I'm not saying anything

774
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:13,199
that I would like to stereotype

775
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,599
or categorize these groups of people entirely.

776
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,119
This is just what his testimony was to me.

777
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,559
They only want me to come to church

778
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,639
because they want my money.

779
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,739
They only want me to come to church

780
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,779
because they want this or they want that.

781
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:25,819
And I said, listen,

782
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,139
you'd have to acknowledge

783
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,619
that through this 40-minute conversation

784
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:30,659
that we've had,

785
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,179
I've never one time told you

786
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,859
you have to come to our church.

787
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,899
I never one time told you

788
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,699
you had to give any money to our church.

789
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,779
I never one time told you,

790
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,579
no, I'm telling you this

791
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,659
because I don't want you to die

792
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,779
and go to the lake of fire.

793
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,659
Because I understand eternity.

794
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,019
I understand Revelation 20.

795
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:46,879
I've read it.

796
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,779
I've read it many, many times.

797
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:51,299
The Bible gives us the record

798
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,679
of the great white throne judgment.

799
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,759
And whosoever has not found written

800
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,679
the book of life was cast in the lake of fire.

801
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,399
This is the second death.

802
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,799
And I said to that young man,

803
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,279
I said, listen,

804
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,079
I'm only telling you this

805
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,679
because I want you to be saved.

806
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,799
There's no strings attached.

807
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,039
There's no, you need to come.

808
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,159
No, no, no, no, none of that.

809
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,359
Why?

810
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,039
Because we understand the importance of salvation.

811
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,159
Now, the truth is what I like

812
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,339
for them to come to our church.

813
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,259
Well, sure.

814
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,859
Because the great commission is not just to see them saved,

815
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,299
but to see them baptized and see them discipled.

816
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:33,619
And we desire to be able to impart to individuals

817
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,899
and to impart the truth of God's word

818
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,419
so that they can grow and develop

819
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:40,179
so that they could do all that God desires for them to do.

820
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,459
But the reality is that we understand

821
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:45,359
the importance of delivering the message.

822
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,739
See, I believe that when I consider the method

823
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:50,279
of the Apostle Paul and I read verses five through nine,

824
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:53,279
and I begin to see the heart of the Apostle Paul

825
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,919
and the way in which he approached people,

826
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,639
I believe that maybe part of the reason

827
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,019
why he approached people the way that he did

828
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,319
is that he had remembered

829
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:04,419
that he was the recipient of grace.

830
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:08,759
I think sometimes when we remember

831
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,359
that we are the recipients of grace,

832
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,199
it enables us to extend grace.

833
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,619
When we remember what the Lord did for us,

834
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,099
see, I'm more likely to extend grace

835
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:26,000
when I'm in that mindset of what He, Christ, did for me.

836
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,179
And therefore, I can approach somebody

837
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:35,179
not seeking to debate them on some socio issue

838
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,339
that's going on in our society,

839
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,859
but confront them with the gospel

840
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,679
because they're gonna die one day.

841
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,419
And they're gonna stand before God one day.

842
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:50,419
And we seek to extend grace

843
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,919
because we've been the recipients of grace.

844
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,539
I believe that when I remember,

845
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,479
as Paul often remembered,

846
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,899
that we once were lost and blinded.

847
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:07,739
It will enable us to have a level of compassion.

848
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,279
It will enable us to be courteous

849
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:11,459
to those that we're seeking to reach.

850
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,019
See, the Bible says that the natural man

851
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,579
received with not the things of the Spirit of God

852
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:17,699
for their foolishness unto him.

853
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:18,639
Neither can he know them.

854
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,479
Why?

855
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,139
Because they're spiritually discerned.

856
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,979
In 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14.

857
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:26,539
The reality is that as we begin

858
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,119
to engage people with the gospel,

859
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,339
we must understand that I once was lost.

860
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:33,299
I once was blinded.

861
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:34,619
I didn't understand.

862
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,059
I've been saved now for this year, praise the Lord.

863
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,079
I'll celebrate 23 years of being saved.

864
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,359
My spiritual birthday, August of 1997.

865
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,839
And I'm looking forward to many more years

866
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,799
of walking with the Lord.

867
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,159
But I understand a whole lot more today,

868
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,559
almost 23 years later, than I did the day I got saved.

869
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,739
I was blinded.

870
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,519
Remember, we read 2 Corinthians 4,

871
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,679
in whom the God of this world

872
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,719
hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, right?

873
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,739
And we find that we, too, were in that position,

874
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,500
and we were lost, and we were undone,

875
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,539
and we were going in a certain direction.

876
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,500
And I understand that.

877
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,379
See, Paul, if you look at his ministry

878
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,299
and you look at his example,

879
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,819
as he stood before those that he had opportunity

880
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,219
to minister to in the book of Acts,

881
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,500
you find that often the apostle Paul

882
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,159
shared his personal testimony.

883
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,659
He remembers back to what we have as a record in Acts 9,

884
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,940
when he was on the road to Damascus.

885
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,219
And he remembers that he was lost,

886
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,779
and he was blinded.

887
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,320
And now we find that he enters into city after city,

888
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,500
engaging person after person with the gospel,

889
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,579
with this method of kindness and gentleness

890
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,799
and a great measure of humility.

891
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,799
Why?

892
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,959
Because he remembers.

893
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,320
He, too, was lost and blinded.

894
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,000
Sometimes we can get frustrated.

895
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,399
I'm guilty.

896
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,919
There are times in which we get frustrated

897
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,159
when we're trying to talk to someone

898
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,659
and trying to share the gospel with them.

899
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,719
But oh, how we need to be mindful of the fact

900
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,679
that the God of this world, Satan himself,

901
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,959
he's blinded the minds of them which believe not.

902
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,919
Listen, there's all kinds of nonsense

903
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:30,899
that's been pumped into the minds of people

904
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,339
in our society today.

905
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,059
I've often said that there was a day

906
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,459
in our nation's history, not a day that I remember,

907
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,640
but a day that I can read of in our nation's history

908
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,119
where you could go to someone

909
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,640
and you could confront them about their need for Christ,

910
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,099
and you could tell them about Adam and Eve

911
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:51,859
and the sin in the garden and understanding that sin,

912
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:54,019
therefore, death has passed upon all men

913
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,659
for that all have sin, Romans chapter number five,

914
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:57,820
and you can share those things.

915
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,739
And people had an idea, they had an awareness.

916
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:06,459
of who Adam and Eve were, they had an understanding, a reference of Genesis 3, they might not have

917
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:11,179
understood all of it, but they'd heard it and they'd understood a portion of it.

918
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:14,339
Today you talk to the average person about Adam and Eve, you talk to the average person

919
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:20,939
about the Garden of Eden, they have no idea what you're talking about, zero.

920
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:29,339
In fact, humanism and Darwinism and all of those other things that are being pumped into

921
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:34,059
the hearts and minds of our young people today, they're being told there wasn't even an Adam

922
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,299
and Eve.

923
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,419
They're being told there was no Garden of Eden.

924
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:45,699
So we have a difficult job, but we have been given this opportunity.

925
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:52,099
And I just wonder this morning, as we said our title, A Passion to Reach the Lost, I

926
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:57,079
wonder as I would examine my own heart, as I would encourage you to examine your heart

927
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:03,279
this morning, would you say that you have a passion to reach the lost?

928
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:06,799
And I've often thought about this in my own life, and I'll ask you to think about this

929
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,279
as well.

930
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:13,479
Would you be accused of having a passion to reach the lost?

931
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:16,239
It's one thing for us to say, yes, I have a passion to reach the lost, but would somebody

932
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,519
else accuse you of it, which would be a good accusation, by the way, but would someone

933
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,679
else say, you know, they have a passion to reach the lost?

934
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,879
And would the evidence support the claim?

935
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,359
Would the evidence support the claim?

936
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,559
I have a passion to reach the lost.

937
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,599
Does the evidence support it?

938
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:43,199
And I ask myself those questions, and I ask that you would reflect, search your heart,

939
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:49,999
that we would sing that song maybe in a new way than we've ever sung it before.

940
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:57,239
Give me a passion for souls, dear Lord, a passion to reach the lost, understanding the

941
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:04,039
truth, the reality, the certainty of eternity, the necessity of conversion, and the power

942
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,559
of the gospel.

943
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,799
I wish this morning, I've said this to people privately, I'm sure at some point over the

944
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:17,839
last almost nine years I've said it publicly as well, sometimes I don't understand why

945
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,919
people reject the gospel.

946
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:22,039
It can be discouraging.

947
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,279
You kind of say, do you understand what I'm offering you?

948
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:29,159
Do you understand, not that I'm offering it, but that God would use us to be the channel,

949
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,199
the conduit, the servant, the vessel that would deliver the message?

950
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,639
So I'm okay, I don't need that.

951
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:41,799
We just pray that our work, as Paul said in verse number two there, it was not in vain.

952
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,999
It's not in vain.

953
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:46,119
We just faithfully go.

954
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,839
I wish everyone I ever shared the gospel with trusted Christ.

955
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:57,579
Far too often, they've rejected the offer of salvation instead of receiving.

956
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:03,519
But we must not allow that to cause us to be discouraged.

957
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,119
We must not allow that to cause us to stop.

958
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,999
We just continue on faithfully delivering the gospel, why?

959
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,919
A passion to reach the lost.

960
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,919
Father, we love you.

961
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:20,119
We thank you for loving us.

962
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:27,119
I thank you for those who went before us, who had a passion to reach the lost.

963
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,719
We think of Paul and Silas and Timothy, as we've looked at this particular account and

964
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,799
considered the ministry in Thessalonica.

965
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:44,039
But no doubt in our own lives, this morning, we can think of those that we've encountered,

966
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,399
maybe even the one that brought the gospel to our family.

967
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:55,399
The one that you used, Lord, as a vessel to confront us with our need for Christ.

968
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:58,719
That they had a passion to reach the lost.

969
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:05,599
And God, I pray that you'd give us a passion, that we'd understand this thing of world missions

970
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,899
and we'd understand that it's important that we support missionaries to go to various places

971
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:15,179
of the world, to take the gospel to every tribe and every nation.

972
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:19,139
And Lord, we thank you for the opportunity to engage in that work.

973
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:26,139
God, would you help us to never forget that this right here is our mission field.

974
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:33,139
Northern Virginia, Oakton, Fairfax, Vienna, Herndon, our mission field.

975
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:40,899
God, help us to be faithful in our families, in our neighborhood, in our workplace, to

976
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,699
have a passion to reach the lost.

977
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:52,699
To have that understanding that each person that I encounter is going to spend forever

978
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,139
in either heaven or the lake of fire.

979
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:01,139
We're eternal beings.

980
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:05,019
Lord, I pray that you'd give us a passion.

981
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:10,699
If there's one that's been watching with us today, oh Father, I pray that you would speak

982
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:13,419
to their hearts, draw them to yourself.

983
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:18,619
We pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness,

984
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,739
of judgment to come.

985
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:24,220
That today would be the day of salvation.

986
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,339
That they would stop putting it off.

987
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:34,099
That they would gladly receive the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ

988
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,940
our Lord.

989
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,380
We pray, God, that you would work as only you can.

990
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:46,099
Help us, Lord, to not only be stirred through this passage of scripture, but God, help us

991
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:47,539
to be changed.

992
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:52,139
We'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.
