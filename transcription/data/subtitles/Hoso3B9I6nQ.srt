1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
Chapter number 13, we looked at the first few verses of Acts 13, actually went down

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:09,800
through verse number 12 and then scattered our way through Acts 13 and 14 as we looked

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,720
at that first missionary journey and dealt with the subject matter sent forth.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,239
Of course, we started in Matthew in chapter number 9 when the Lord Jesus Christ, the Scriptures

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,680
tell us that He was moved with compassion on them because they had been scattered as

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,959
sheep without a shepherd.

7
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,760
He had said to pray there for the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth laborers

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,559
into His harvest.

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:39,080
Of course, we know that the harvest is plenteous, the laborers are few, and God moved in the

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,599
church at Antioch and sent forth these first group of missionaries, and it's amazing as

11
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:48,119
they went into the region of Galatia and the churches that were established and the way

12
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,319
in which God worked.

13
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:53,599
And as you near the end of chapter number 14, you have the privilege of being able to

14
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:58,599
read about their follow-up work, and beginning in verse number 21 down through verse number

15
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:03,759
25, you really see how that they revisited these particular places in which God had led

16
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,760
them to.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,239
And notice what the Bible says in verse number 21, and when they had preached the gospel

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:16,800
to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch,

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,919
confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and

20
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:26,080
that we must, through much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of God.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,400
And when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting,

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,360
they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,160
And what great verses that provide for us, really, the practice and discipline of follow-up

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,860
and the way in which they wanted to ensure that the local church was established and

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
had leadership.

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,900
And we come to verse number 27, and the Bible says this, and when they were come and had

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,739
gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how He

28
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,419
had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

29
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:06,099
I like to use that phrase, if you will, from verse number 27 as our title this evening,

30
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,619
they rehearsed all that God had done.

31
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,059
They rehearsed all that God had done.

32
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,059
God is working.

33
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:17,740
God is always working.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
Amen?

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,820
He's always at work.

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,020
And there are times in which we may not see God at work, we may not understand how God

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,979
is working, but we understand that God is always at work.

38
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:37,580
And it's a unique privilege that we have as the people of God to be used of God for His

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,660
honor and for His glory, to be engaged in the work that God is doing.

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,639
And it is exciting, and there are times in which we're able to see very clearly during

41
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,059
the process how God is working and seeing God's hand at work.

42
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:58,940
And there are other times in which after the fact, perhaps days, weeks, or even months

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,419
or years later, we look back and we hear testimony of how God was at work.

44
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,380
And it's a unique privilege of ours to be partners together, co-laborers with the Lord

45
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,179
to see what He's doing, how He's working.

46
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:21,419
And here, as these missionaries would fulfill the work that God had called them to, we find

47
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,940
that they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,059
We read down through verse number 23, I want you to notice in verse 24 and 25, the Bible

49
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,699
says, And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

50
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:39,059
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down unto Athaliah, and thence sailed

51
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,940
to Antioch.

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,740
Notice what it says, From whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,339
work which they fulfilled.

54
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:51,580
You notice, and you'll remember if you were with us last Wednesday evening, that it was

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,820
there in Acts 13, that they were ministering there at the church at Antioch.

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,860
And the Holy Ghost, the Lord came and said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

57
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,500
whereunto I have called them.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:11,179
What a joy to read the last words of verse 26, that they fulfilled the work.

59
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:16,720
They completed the task that God had assigned them to, and they returned to Antioch, according

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,380
to verse number 26.

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,339
And so, as you look at the text this evening, and really just sharing a few thoughts as

62
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:27,140
we prepare for our missions conference that will begin on Saturday and go through Wednesday,

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,940
I want you to notice first of all, according to verse number 26, the missionaries returned.

64
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,179
The work was fulfilled that was given to them, and they now are going to return to

65
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,420
their sending church.

66
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,500
You remember that the church at Antioch, as they were ministering and as they were serving,

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,579
that the Bible said in verse number 3 of Acts 13, that when they had fasted and prayed and

68
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,079
laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

69
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:57,100
Now you understand that the technology that exists today did not exist in the first century.

70
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,619
The opportunity for instant communication and instant access and updates and phone calls

71
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:07,679
and instant messengers and all of that sort of thing did not exist.

72
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:14,140
And so as the believers at the church at Antioch, as they followed the plan that God had revealed

73
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,980
to them, and they sent forth Paul and Barnabas, and John obviously helped them as well for

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,299
a period of that time, and as they sent them forth, I believe that the people of the church

75
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,700
at Antioch, they were praying for them.

76
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,380
They did not know specifically what was happening.

77
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,100
They did not know all that they would encounter.

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,260
They did not know the blessings nor the adversity that they would face.

79
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,579
But yet, I believe they were engaged in prayer.

80
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,339
They were invested in the work.

81
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,339
They were co-laborers.

82
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:48,140
Yes, it was true that God would send forth Paul and Barnabas to go and take this first

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,619
missionary journey, but there were a group of believers that were invested in the work

84
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,739
and they were praying for these servants of the Lord.

85
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:01,579
And so as we begin to understand that they're returning to Antioch, and in my mind's eye,

86
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:07,459
if I can just for a moment this evening understand what's happening here in Acts 14 and the excitement

87
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,739
that must be brewing, if you will, when word comes that they're returning.

88
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,779
Paul and Barnabas, they've been gone and they've been on this journey and now they're returning.

89
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,019
There's a level of excitement in my mind on the part of the believers of the church

90
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,019
at Antioch.

91
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,019
Why?

92
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,459
Because they've been praying for these men.

93
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,260
They want to know, what is God doing?

94
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,779
How has God been working?

95
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,700
I've often looked at this portion of Scripture in Acts 14 and often looked at it as being

96
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,579
the first missions conference, a time in which these missionaries come back and they return

97
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,940
to the sending church.

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,779
And we understand that today, when we have a missions conference, things are slightly

99
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:49,160
different than they were here in the book of Acts, and it's not that these individual

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,019
missionaries that were having to come back to us or come to be with us, even for the

101
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:59,500
first time, they're not necessarily sent out from our group, from our midst, as Paul and

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Barnabas were.

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,059
But can you imagine the excitement?

104
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:09,579
I mean, listen, there might be some within the church at Antioch there, when they had

105
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:15,179
heard that Paul and Barnabas were returning, that they spread the word, hey, they're coming

106
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,500
back and they're going to give us some information.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,820
And we notice that they return in verse number 26, but then we notice that the missionaries

108
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
report.

109
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,940
The missionaries return, but then the missionaries report.

110
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,500
And what is it that they report?

111
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,579
Well, it's interesting, the Bible says, and when they were come, notice this in verse

112
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:39,459
27, and had gathered the church together.

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,700
The missionaries return, Paul and Barnabas return to the church at Antioch, and it says

114
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,299
that they gathered the church together.

115
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,579
And I think it's interesting that you note that in verse number 27, the church, as we

116
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,739
know, is an assembly.

117
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:58,859
And we are to assemble, and we come together, and we find here, there's no indication that

118
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:04,619
this particular time of returning was a normal scheduled service, if you will.

119
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:09,700
They had returned, and they were going to report, and the churches gathered, and no

120
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,420
doubt there's a level of excitement on the part of these believers, and the Bible then

121
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,500
tells us in verse 27, they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

122
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,179
And I begin to think about that phrase.

123
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:27,980
I know that we've used it this evening as our title for our message, and the Bible says

124
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,320
they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

125
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,479
And it says this, and how He, God, had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

126
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,760
And I begin to note how that they rehearsed all, and I begin to think about the timing

127
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,619
of the journey and the various aspects, and we know that we have some information here

128
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:58,440
in the Word of God with regard to this missionary journey, and we can read Acts 13 and Acts

129
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,880
14, and we can read about the cities and the work that was done, but no doubt every detail

130
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,760
isn't provided here for us.

131
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,359
And I believe that as they begin to share all that God has done, and they're rehearsing

132
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:17,799
this, can you just for a moment think about the excitement?

133
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,280
The individual believers of that church that were co-laborers, they had partnered together,

134
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,299
no, we're not going with you, but we're staying here and we're praying for you.

135
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,799
And as the missionaries would return and they begin to report, and they would begin to share

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,960
what God has done, and we find that the Bible says that they rehearsed all that God had

137
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,900
done with them.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,200
What a joy that God would use us.

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,880
We understand that even by looking at the way in which the words are used here in this

140
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,280
verse of Scripture, that they did not return and say, listen to what we did, listen to

141
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,479
how we accomplished, no, this is how the Lord used us.

142
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,919
This is what the Lord did in and through us.

143
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:05,359
And as we would begin to consider this period of time, I believe that it was not an hour

144
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,359
service.

145
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,880
Get in, get out.

146
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,419
You understand what I'm saying?

147
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,200
Why was it that perhaps, I mean, the Bible doesn't tell us, but if they rehearsed all

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,919
that God did, I think they were there for a little while.

149
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,919
And in my mind, and as I look at the Scriptures, I don't think that people were worried about

150
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,200
what time it was, and when we're getting out, and when we're going to get home, and

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
when we can get back to our schedule, our routine.

152
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,640
No, they were hearing how God was working.

153
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,880
They were hearing how they went into the city, and how the Gospel was preached, and people

154
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
were saved.

155
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,960
I mean, that's exciting.

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,080
And I believe this evening that as these missionaries reported, and as they gave updates, and as

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,000
they provided what it was that God was doing, I believe that there's this level of excitement

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,799
that just continues to brew amongst the believers.

159
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:13,239
Perhaps, as Paul begins to share a specific story, maybe talking about some of the opposition

160
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:18,320
in which they face, but how that God delivered, and how God worked, and how God gave open

161
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,039
doors and opportunities.

162
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,679
How that there are believers that are sitting there that are listening and hearing what

163
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,880
is being rehearsed, and they're mindful of how the Holy Spirit of God had prompted them

164
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,880
to pray at specific times for specific things, and they didn't even know all that was going

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,520
on, but yet they were engaged in prayer.

166
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:46,520
See, the work of God is a work that we have the unique privilege of being in on.

167
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,619
We get to serve God.

168
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:51,200
We get to serve alongside one another.

169
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:56,039
We know that Paul would say, as he would write back to the church in Corinth, and of course

170
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,119
there was much division and difficulty there, but we're mindful of this, that Paul says

171
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:05,400
this in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 5,

172
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,080
Who then is Paul?

173
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,219
And who is Apollos?

174
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:14,960
But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.

175
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,479
Paul says this in verse 6 of 1 Corinthians 3,

176
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:23,400
I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

177
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,719
So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth

178
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,479
the increase.

179
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:34,599
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own

180
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,200
reward according to his own labor.

181
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,239
Notice this in verse number 9 of 1 Corinthians 3,

182
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:45,559
For we are laborers together with God.

183
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,280
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

184
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,320
I mean, what a joy to understand that God would allow us to serve him.

185
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,219
And as we think about this work of missions, and we think about this missions conference

186
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:02,840
that we're going to have, and these three missionary families that are going to be with

187
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,479
us, they've never been here before, so it really wouldn't be fair for us to say they're

188
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:09,859
returning because they're just coming for the first time.

189
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:13,039
But as these missionaries come, they're going to give report.

190
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,000
They're going to begin to share how God has worked in their lives, how God has brought

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,479
them to the place of surrender to go to the field in which they're serving, and we'll

192
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:26,619
have the opportunity to hear from missionaries that have been on the field for a lengthy

193
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:32,000
period of time, and then from a missionary family that's just a young family on deputation.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,979
They've not been to Uganda yet, but oh, how God has blessed and worked even as they've

195
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:41,960
been on deputation, and to consider what God has done and how God has prepared them and

196
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,719
how God has used them.

197
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:48,760
And we believe that as we have the privilege of hearing the reports from the missionaries,

198
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,640
I just yesterday was speaking with Brother Maldoff, and I'll give you a little bit of

199
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,960
a preview.

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,719
One of the things, because he's the Southeast Asia director for BIMI, and Papua New Guinea

201
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:05,159
is in the region in which he is the director, and we had the privilege a couple of years

202
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:11,840
ago as a church to give money specifically for Bibles to be distributed in Papua New Guinea.

203
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,599
And we took the whole month of June in 2018 to collect money.

204
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,799
It was $3 a Bible.

205
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,840
We challenged you, and you responded, and I don't remember the exact number now.

206
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,880
I think it was, it doesn't matter, it was a good amount of money that we're able to

207
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,919
send to the Papua New Guinea Bible Project, and we've received some updates, and I was

208
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,559
speaking with Brother Maldoff yesterday, and I said, hey, Brother, I know that you're not

209
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,359
leading that project, but it's in your region.

210
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,440
On Wednesday night, would you give us an update on that?

211
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,840
He said, oh, man, it'd be so exciting to share what God is doing and how God is working.

212
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,599
I'm looking forward to hearing that.

213
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm looking forward to hearing about the work that's taking place and how souls have been

214
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,799
saved and lives have been changed.

215
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,799
Why?

216
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,479
Because the entrance of thy work giveth light, and we had a part in that.

217
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,479
Amen?

218
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:06,479
There's going to be somebody that you might meet one day in heaven that you put that $3

219
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:13,000
to a plate so that a Bible could be purchased, and they got the Word of God, and it changed

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,440
their life the same way it changed your life.

221
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,599
And when we get to hear the report, listen, it's not just, man, when's it going to be

222
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,599
done?

223
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,599
When are we going to get out?

224
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:26,840
Sometimes we can be like that.

225
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,919
Somebody said this, a friend of mine, he said, I don't come to church to get out, I come

226
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,119
in to get something.

227
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:35,280
I think it's good.

228
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,599
And here we see that the missionaries return, the missionaries report.

229
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:46,159
You don't see it here in these words, but if I were to give a final point to the message

230
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,119
this evening, I'd say the people rejoice.

231
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,479
The people rejoice.

232
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:54,280
The Bible says that there in verse number 27, and when they were come and had gathered

233
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,000
the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how He, God, had

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,760
opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles, and there they abode long time with the disciples.

235
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
I believe there was some rejoicing that was going on.

236
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,799
I believe that as they were hearing these reports and hearing these testimonies of how

237
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,320
God was working and what God was doing, there were people rejoicing, excited.

238
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,280
Perhaps there were times during the report as it was given that maybe one would interrupt

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,320
and say, can you tell us a little bit more about that?

240
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,599
I mean, maybe after the formal part of the meeting, if you will, was completed, that

241
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:38,359
just as we have opportunities, I'm trying to think about it in the light of how we operate

242
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:42,799
when we have a missions conference and how we get to greet the missionaries individually

243
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,520
and chat with them and how we can, hey, you shared this in your update and you mentioned

244
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,320
this while you were preaching, can you tell me a little bit more about that?

245
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,400
How does that work there?

246
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,640
What is it that we, how can we pray more effectively for you as you serve in that capacity?

247
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,199
And we begin to rejoice in what God is doing, and ultimately we're giving honor and glory

248
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,959
to the Lord because He's the one that's done the work.

249
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,319
And we're saying to God be the glory.

250
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,959
Great things He hath done, but you know what's exciting to be part of it?

251
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,520
I've often said over the years for us to be involved in world missions is for us to be

252
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,479
involved in what God is doing globally.

253
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,520
And God is working globally.

254
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,000
It is absolutely exciting.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,640
I know sometimes we can get the perspective of how bad things are in America and how the

256
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
church scene is here in America.

257
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,140
I got a periodical across my desk today that said 43% of millennials said they don't know

258
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,760
and they don't care whether God exists.

259
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,719
That's a high percentage.

260
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:52,959
But we begin to read some things about what God is doing in other parts of the world and

261
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,400
how God is working.

262
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,680
God is at work.

263
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,239
God's at work here too.

264
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,280
He's working in America.

265
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,439
I know that the things that are on the mainstream media and all that we're being told, it seems

266
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:13,880
so dark and so terrible and so just, and there's a lot of problems, but you know God's working.

267
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,520
God's working in the hearts of people.

268
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,680
We'll share an update here in just a moment on the back of our bulletin this evening from

269
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,959
Brother Deal and he shares how that while they were nearing some door-to-door outreach

270
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:29,920
and what have you and they were in a particular area, community, and they just were met with

271
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,560
great levels of opposition.

272
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,800
And then COVID came and lockdowns and they had to leave and all sorts of things and they've

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,959
gotten back to the field and that's one of the neighborhoods that they first went back

274
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:45,479
to and he said, you know, the attitude is completely different.

275
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,640
People are open.

276
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
People are receptive.

277
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,719
Why is it that we seek to have updates from our missionaries on a regular basis?

278
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:57,400
Why is it that we take the time to put them on the back of a bulletin every Wednesday

279
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
evening?

280
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Why is it that we take time in our service on Sunday morning to get an update?

281
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,800
Because I don't want to hear what God's doing.

282
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,280
I have the privilege of being the pastor and reading every letter that comes across my

283
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,599
desk.

284
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,040
But if we don't share it with you, you don't know what's going on and you have no reason

285
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,680
to rejoice.

286
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,839
So as we think about this missions conference, and I hope that you'd purpose to be here,

287
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,479
I understand schedules and work and all that sort of thing, but when we really understand

288
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:30,719
what's happening and how the missionaries are coming and they're reporting that people

289
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:37,199
are going to rejoice, we see this model here in Acts 14, man, I don't want to miss it.

290
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:41,560
I mean, could you imagine if somebody there, I don't know what was going on in Antioch

291
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,920
at this time.

292
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,599
I know there's some things going on in our world at this time that can take our attention.

293
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,920
A junior has baseball practice, this one has that, this one has that.

294
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,359
We can't make it to missions conference because we got this going on.

295
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:00,479
And then they begin to hear what was reported, man, I missed it.

296
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,099
I missed it.

297
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,060
I don't want to miss it.

298
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm not saying that because I want to have some level of great attendance or something

299
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
for the mission.

300
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm being sincere.

301
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,160
I don't want to miss it.

302
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,800
I want to know what God's doing and how God's working.

303
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,359
I want to know what God has for me.

304
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,800
These guys are going to preach messages.

305
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
What does God have for me?

306
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,780
How is he going to work in my heart, in my life?

307
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,400
And so this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture and really one final preparation

308
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,520
message if you will, as we then turn to our missions conference, they rehearsed all that

309
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,380
God had done.

310
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,959
God is working.

311
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:40,880
And I am very excited about the opportunity to have a missions conference.

312
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,839
I tried to share with someone just in the last few days about missions conference, and

313
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,839
they don't go to church.

314
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,839
I don't think they're saved.

315
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,839
And they just had asked if we had anything busy going on, anything on the schedule, and

316
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,640
I shared a little bit about the missions conference.

317
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,000
And I mean, they had no concept, no idea whatsoever.

318
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,439
And I really didn't expect them to, but they asked a question.

319
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,640
I provided an answer.

320
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,979
But for us as the people of God, when we think about these missionaries, and man, as I personally

321
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,099
and you personally have given dollars to support missions, don't you want to hear how God's

322
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,099
working?

323
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:16,260
Don't you want to hear what God's doing?

324
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
They rehearsed.

325
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:24,380
The missionaries returned, they reported, and the people rejoiced because God was working.

326
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
Let's pray.

327
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,459
Father, we love you.

328
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,579
We thank you for loving us.

329
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,979
Thank you for your word.

330
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:37,140
Lord, I pray that as we, as a local church, prepare for our missions conference, I pray

331
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:44,579
that our hearts will be soft and tender, receptive.

332
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:53,739
I pray, God, that you would work in our midst, help us as individuals to purpose to be here.

333
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:58,859
Lord, I pray for the missionaries and their families as they travel, that you would give

334
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:06,260
safety and give clarity and wisdom with regard to messages, and Lord, I pray that through

335
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:13,020
all that would be said and done, that you alone would be glorified, that we as thy people

336
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,339
would rejoice greatly as we have the privilege of hearing all that you're doing.

337
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,420
We're excited.

338
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,459
We have a great level of anticipation of how you'd work in our midst.

339
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,459
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

340
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,140
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

341
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:39,180
We thank you for the confidence that we have that you hear and answer prayer.

342
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,180
I pray that you'd be glorified through the remainder of our service.

343
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,739
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
