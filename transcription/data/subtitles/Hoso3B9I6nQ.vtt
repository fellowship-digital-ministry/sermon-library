WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.039
Chapter number 13, we looked at the first few verses of Acts 13, actually went down

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.800
through verse number 12 and then scattered our way through Acts 13 and 14 as we looked

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.720
at that first missionary journey and dealt with the subject matter sent forth.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.239
Of course, we started in Matthew in chapter number 9 when the Lord Jesus Christ, the Scriptures

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.680
tell us that He was moved with compassion on them because they had been scattered as

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.959
sheep without a shepherd.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.760
He had said to pray there for the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth laborers

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.559
into His harvest.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:39.080
Of course, we know that the harvest is plenteous, the laborers are few, and God moved in the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.599
church at Antioch and sent forth these first group of missionaries, and it's amazing as

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:48.119
they went into the region of Galatia and the churches that were established and the way

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.319
in which God worked.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.599
And as you near the end of chapter number 14, you have the privilege of being able to

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:58.599
read about their follow-up work, and beginning in verse number 21 down through verse number

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:03.759
25, you really see how that they revisited these particular places in which God had led

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.760
them to.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.239
And notice what the Bible says in verse number 21, and when they had preached the gospel

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:16.800
to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.919
confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:26.080
that we must, through much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of God.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.400
And when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.360
they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.160
And what great verses that provide for us, really, the practice and discipline of follow-up

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.860
and the way in which they wanted to ensure that the local church was established and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.860
had leadership.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.900
And we come to verse number 27, and the Bible says this, and when they were come and had

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.739
gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how He

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.419
had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:06.099
I like to use that phrase, if you will, from verse number 27 as our title this evening,

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.619
they rehearsed all that God had done.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.059
They rehearsed all that God had done.

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.059
God is working.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.740
God is always working.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.740
Amen?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.820
He's always at work.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.020
And there are times in which we may not see God at work, we may not understand how God

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.979
is working, but we understand that God is always at work.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:37.580
And it's a unique privilege that we have as the people of God to be used of God for His

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.660
honor and for His glory, to be engaged in the work that God is doing.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.639
And it is exciting, and there are times in which we're able to see very clearly during

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.059
the process how God is working and seeing God's hand at work.

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.940
And there are other times in which after the fact, perhaps days, weeks, or even months

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.419
or years later, we look back and we hear testimony of how God was at work.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:12.380
And it's a unique privilege of ours to be partners together, co-laborers with the Lord

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.179
to see what He's doing, how He's working.

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:21.419
And here, as these missionaries would fulfill the work that God had called them to, we find

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.940
that they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.059
We read down through verse number 23, I want you to notice in verse 24 and 25, the Bible

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.699
says, And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.059
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down unto Athaliah, and thence sailed

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.940
to Antioch.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.740
Notice what it says, From whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.339
work which they fulfilled.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.580
You notice, and you'll remember if you were with us last Wednesday evening, that it was

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.820
there in Acts 13, that they were ministering there at the church at Antioch.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.860
And the Holy Ghost, the Lord came and said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.500
whereunto I have called them.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.179
What a joy to read the last words of verse 26, that they fulfilled the work.

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:16.720
They completed the task that God had assigned them to, and they returned to Antioch, according

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.380
to verse number 26.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.339
And so, as you look at the text this evening, and really just sharing a few thoughts as

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:27.140
we prepare for our missions conference that will begin on Saturday and go through Wednesday,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.940
I want you to notice first of all, according to verse number 26, the missionaries returned.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.179
The work was fulfilled that was given to them, and they now are going to return to

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:37.420
their sending church.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.500
You remember that the church at Antioch, as they were ministering and as they were serving,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.579
that the Bible said in verse number 3 of Acts 13, that when they had fasted and prayed and

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:51.079
laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:57.100
Now you understand that the technology that exists today did not exist in the first century.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.619
The opportunity for instant communication and instant access and updates and phone calls

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.679
and instant messengers and all of that sort of thing did not exist.

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:14.140
And so as the believers at the church at Antioch, as they followed the plan that God had revealed

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.980
to them, and they sent forth Paul and Barnabas, and John obviously helped them as well for

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.299
a period of that time, and as they sent them forth, I believe that the people of the church

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:27.700
at Antioch, they were praying for them.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.380
They did not know specifically what was happening.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.100
They did not know all that they would encounter.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.260
They did not know the blessings nor the adversity that they would face.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.579
But yet, I believe they were engaged in prayer.

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:42.339
They were invested in the work.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:43.339
They were co-laborers.

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:48.140
Yes, it was true that God would send forth Paul and Barnabas to go and take this first

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.619
missionary journey, but there were a group of believers that were invested in the work

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.739
and they were praying for these servants of the Lord.

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:01.579
And so as we begin to understand that they're returning to Antioch, and in my mind's eye,

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:07.459
if I can just for a moment this evening understand what's happening here in Acts 14 and the excitement

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:12.739
that must be brewing, if you will, when word comes that they're returning.

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.779
Paul and Barnabas, they've been gone and they've been on this journey and now they're returning.

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.019
There's a level of excitement in my mind on the part of the believers of the church

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:23.019
at Antioch.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:24.019
Why?

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:25.459
Because they've been praying for these men.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:27.260
They want to know, what is God doing?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.779
How has God been working?

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.700
I've often looked at this portion of Scripture in Acts 14 and often looked at it as being

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.579
the first missions conference, a time in which these missionaries come back and they return

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:38.940
to the sending church.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.779
And we understand that today, when we have a missions conference, things are slightly

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.160
different than they were here in the book of Acts, and it's not that these individual

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.019
missionaries that were having to come back to us or come to be with us, even for the

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:59.500
first time, they're not necessarily sent out from our group, from our midst, as Paul and

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.100
Barnabas were.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.059
But can you imagine the excitement?

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:09.579
I mean, listen, there might be some within the church at Antioch there, when they had

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.179
heard that Paul and Barnabas were returning, that they spread the word, hey, they're coming

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:18.500
back and they're going to give us some information.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.820
And we notice that they return in verse number 26, but then we notice that the missionaries

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.820
report.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.940
The missionaries return, but then the missionaries report.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.500
And what is it that they report?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.579
Well, it's interesting, the Bible says, and when they were come, notice this in verse

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:39.459
27, and had gathered the church together.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:43.700
The missionaries return, Paul and Barnabas return to the church at Antioch, and it says

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.299
that they gathered the church together.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:50.579
And I think it's interesting that you note that in verse number 27, the church, as we

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:52.739
know, is an assembly.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:58.859
And we are to assemble, and we come together, and we find here, there's no indication that

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:04.619
this particular time of returning was a normal scheduled service, if you will.

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:09.700
They had returned, and they were going to report, and the churches gathered, and no

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.420
doubt there's a level of excitement on the part of these believers, and the Bible then

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.500
tells us in verse 27, they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.179
And I begin to think about that phrase.

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:27.980
I know that we've used it this evening as our title for our message, and the Bible says

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:34.320
they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.479
And it says this, and how He, God, had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:48.760
And I begin to note how that they rehearsed all, and I begin to think about the timing

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.619
of the journey and the various aspects, and we know that we have some information here

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:58.440
in the Word of God with regard to this missionary journey, and we can read Acts 13 and Acts

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.880
14, and we can read about the cities and the work that was done, but no doubt every detail

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.760
isn't provided here for us.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.359
And I believe that as they begin to share all that God has done, and they're rehearsing

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:17.799
this, can you just for a moment think about the excitement?

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:22.280
The individual believers of that church that were co-laborers, they had partnered together,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.299
no, we're not going with you, but we're staying here and we're praying for you.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:30.799
And as the missionaries would return and they begin to report, and they would begin to share

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.960
what God has done, and we find that the Bible says that they rehearsed all that God had

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.900
done with them.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.200
What a joy that God would use us.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.880
We understand that even by looking at the way in which the words are used here in this

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.280
verse of Scripture, that they did not return and say, listen to what we did, listen to

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.479
how we accomplished, no, this is how the Lord used us.

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:57.919
This is what the Lord did in and through us.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:05.359
And as we would begin to consider this period of time, I believe that it was not an hour

00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:06.359
service.

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:09.880
Get in, get out.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.419
You understand what I'm saying?

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:17.200
Why was it that perhaps, I mean, the Bible doesn't tell us, but if they rehearsed all

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.919
that God did, I think they were there for a little while.

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:26.919
And in my mind, and as I look at the Scriptures, I don't think that people were worried about

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:30.200
what time it was, and when we're getting out, and when we're going to get home, and

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200
when we can get back to our schedule, our routine.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.640
No, they were hearing how God was working.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.880
They were hearing how they went into the city, and how the Gospel was preached, and people

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880
were saved.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.960
I mean, that's exciting.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.080
And I believe this evening that as these missionaries reported, and as they gave updates, and as

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.000
they provided what it was that God was doing, I believe that there's this level of excitement

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.799
that just continues to brew amongst the believers.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:13.239
Perhaps, as Paul begins to share a specific story, maybe talking about some of the opposition

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:18.320
in which they face, but how that God delivered, and how God worked, and how God gave open

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.039
doors and opportunities.

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:23.679
How that there are believers that are sitting there that are listening and hearing what

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:28.880
is being rehearsed, and they're mindful of how the Holy Spirit of God had prompted them

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.880
to pray at specific times for specific things, and they didn't even know all that was going

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.520
on, but yet they were engaged in prayer.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:46.520
See, the work of God is a work that we have the unique privilege of being in on.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.619
We get to serve God.

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:51.200
We get to serve alongside one another.

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:56.039
We know that Paul would say, as he would write back to the church in Corinth, and of course

00:11:56.039 --> 00:12:02.119
there was much division and difficulty there, but we're mindful of this, that Paul says

00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:05.400
this in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 5,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.080
Who then is Paul?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.219
And who is Apollos?

00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:14.960
But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.479
Paul says this in verse 6 of 1 Corinthians 3,

00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:23.400
I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.719
So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.479
the increase.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:34.599
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own

00:12:34.599 --> 00:12:37.200
reward according to his own labor.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.239
Notice this in verse number 9 of 1 Corinthians 3,

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:45.559
For we are laborers together with God.

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:50.280
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.320
I mean, what a joy to understand that God would allow us to serve him.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.219
And as we think about this work of missions, and we think about this missions conference

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:02.840
that we're going to have, and these three missionary families that are going to be with

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.479
us, they've never been here before, so it really wouldn't be fair for us to say they're

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:09.859
returning because they're just coming for the first time.

00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:13.039
But as these missionaries come, they're going to give report.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:18.000
They're going to begin to share how God has worked in their lives, how God has brought

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.479
them to the place of surrender to go to the field in which they're serving, and we'll

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:26.619
have the opportunity to hear from missionaries that have been on the field for a lengthy

00:13:26.619 --> 00:13:32.000
period of time, and then from a missionary family that's just a young family on deputation.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.979
They've not been to Uganda yet, but oh, how God has blessed and worked even as they've

00:13:36.979 --> 00:13:41.960
been on deputation, and to consider what God has done and how God has prepared them and

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.719
how God has used them.

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:48.760
And we believe that as we have the privilege of hearing the reports from the missionaries,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.640
I just yesterday was speaking with Brother Maldoff, and I'll give you a little bit of

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.960
a preview.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.719
One of the things, because he's the Southeast Asia director for BIMI, and Papua New Guinea

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:05.159
is in the region in which he is the director, and we had the privilege a couple of years

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:11.840
ago as a church to give money specifically for Bibles to be distributed in Papua New Guinea.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.599
And we took the whole month of June in 2018 to collect money.

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:16.799
It was $3 a Bible.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:20.840
We challenged you, and you responded, and I don't remember the exact number now.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.880
I think it was, it doesn't matter, it was a good amount of money that we're able to

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.919
send to the Papua New Guinea Bible Project, and we've received some updates, and I was

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:33.559
speaking with Brother Maldoff yesterday, and I said, hey, Brother, I know that you're not

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:36.359
leading that project, but it's in your region.

00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:38.440
On Wednesday night, would you give us an update on that?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.840
He said, oh, man, it'd be so exciting to share what God is doing and how God is working.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.599
I'm looking forward to hearing that.

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:51.760
I'm looking forward to hearing about the work that's taking place and how souls have been

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.799
saved and lives have been changed.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:54.799
Why?

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:59.479
Because the entrance of thy work giveth light, and we had a part in that.

00:14:59.479 --> 00:15:00.479
Amen?

00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:06.479
There's going to be somebody that you might meet one day in heaven that you put that $3

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:13.000
to a plate so that a Bible could be purchased, and they got the Word of God, and it changed

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.440
their life the same way it changed your life.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.599
And when we get to hear the report, listen, it's not just, man, when's it going to be

00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:21.599
done?

00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:23.599
When are we going to get out?

00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:26.840
Sometimes we can be like that.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.919
Somebody said this, a friend of mine, he said, I don't come to church to get out, I come

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:32.119
in to get something.

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:35.280
I think it's good.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.599
And here we see that the missionaries return, the missionaries report.

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:46.159
You don't see it here in these words, but if I were to give a final point to the message

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:49.119
this evening, I'd say the people rejoice.

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:50.479
The people rejoice.

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:54.280
The Bible says that there in verse number 27, and when they were come and had gathered

00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:00.000
the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how He, God, had

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.760
opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles, and there they abode long time with the disciples.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.640
I believe there was some rejoicing that was going on.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.799
I believe that as they were hearing these reports and hearing these testimonies of how

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:20.320
God was working and what God was doing, there were people rejoicing, excited.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.280
Perhaps there were times during the report as it was given that maybe one would interrupt

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.320
and say, can you tell us a little bit more about that?

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.599
I mean, maybe after the formal part of the meeting, if you will, was completed, that

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:38.359
just as we have opportunities, I'm trying to think about it in the light of how we operate

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:42.799
when we have a missions conference and how we get to greet the missionaries individually

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:47.520
and chat with them and how we can, hey, you shared this in your update and you mentioned

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.320
this while you were preaching, can you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.400
How does that work there?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.640
What is it that we, how can we pray more effectively for you as you serve in that capacity?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.199
And we begin to rejoice in what God is doing, and ultimately we're giving honor and glory

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:07.959
to the Lord because He's the one that's done the work.

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:13.319
And we're saying to God be the glory.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:18.959
Great things He hath done, but you know what's exciting to be part of it?

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:23.520
I've often said over the years for us to be involved in world missions is for us to be

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.479
involved in what God is doing globally.

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:28.520
And God is working globally.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.000
It is absolutely exciting.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.640
I know sometimes we can get the perspective of how bad things are in America and how the

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.040
church scene is here in America.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.140
I got a periodical across my desk today that said 43% of millennials said they don't know

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.760
and they don't care whether God exists.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.719
That's a high percentage.

00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:52.959
But we begin to read some things about what God is doing in other parts of the world and

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:54.400
how God is working.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.680
God is at work.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.239
God's at work here too.

00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:01.280
He's working in America.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.439
I know that the things that are on the mainstream media and all that we're being told, it seems

00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:13.880
so dark and so terrible and so just, and there's a lot of problems, but you know God's working.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.520
God's working in the hearts of people.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.680
We'll share an update here in just a moment on the back of our bulletin this evening from

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:25.959
Brother Deal and he shares how that while they were nearing some door-to-door outreach

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:29.920
and what have you and they were in a particular area, community, and they just were met with

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.560
great levels of opposition.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.800
And then COVID came and lockdowns and they had to leave and all sorts of things and they've

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.959
gotten back to the field and that's one of the neighborhoods that they first went back

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:45.479
to and he said, you know, the attitude is completely different.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:46.640
People are open.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.280
People are receptive.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.719
Why is it that we seek to have updates from our missionaries on a regular basis?

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:57.400
Why is it that we take the time to put them on the back of a bulletin every Wednesday

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400
evening?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.560
Why is it that we take time in our service on Sunday morning to get an update?

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.800
Because I don't want to hear what God's doing.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.280
I have the privilege of being the pastor and reading every letter that comes across my

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.599
desk.

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:13.040
But if we don't share it with you, you don't know what's going on and you have no reason

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.680
to rejoice.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.839
So as we think about this missions conference, and I hope that you'd purpose to be here,

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:25.479
I understand schedules and work and all that sort of thing, but when we really understand

00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:30.719
what's happening and how the missionaries are coming and they're reporting that people

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:37.199
are going to rejoice, we see this model here in Acts 14, man, I don't want to miss it.

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:41.560
I mean, could you imagine if somebody there, I don't know what was going on in Antioch

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.920
at this time.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.599
I know there's some things going on in our world at this time that can take our attention.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:52.920
A junior has baseball practice, this one has that, this one has that.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.359
We can't make it to missions conference because we got this going on.

00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:00.479
And then they begin to hear what was reported, man, I missed it.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.099
I missed it.

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:04.060
I don't want to miss it.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.900
I'm not saying that because I want to have some level of great attendance or something

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.900
for the mission.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.900
I'm being sincere.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.160
I don't want to miss it.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.800
I want to know what God's doing and how God's working.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.359
I want to know what God has for me.

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:17.800
These guys are going to preach messages.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.000
What does God have for me?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.780
How is he going to work in my heart, in my life?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:28.400
And so this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture and really one final preparation

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.520
message if you will, as we then turn to our missions conference, they rehearsed all that

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.380
God had done.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.959
God is working.

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:40.880
And I am very excited about the opportunity to have a missions conference.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.839
I tried to share with someone just in the last few days about missions conference, and

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:46.839
they don't go to church.

00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:47.839
I don't think they're saved.

00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:51.839
And they just had asked if we had anything busy going on, anything on the schedule, and

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:53.640
I shared a little bit about the missions conference.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.000
And I mean, they had no concept, no idea whatsoever.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.439
And I really didn't expect them to, but they asked a question.

00:20:59.439 --> 00:21:01.640
I provided an answer.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.979
But for us as the people of God, when we think about these missionaries, and man, as I personally

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:12.099
and you personally have given dollars to support missions, don't you want to hear how God's

00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:13.099
working?

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:16.260
Don't you want to hear what God's doing?

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.260
They rehearsed.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:24.380
The missionaries returned, they reported, and the people rejoiced because God was working.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.380
Let's pray.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.459
Father, we love you.

00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:28.579
We thank you for loving us.

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:29.979
Thank you for your word.

00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:37.140
Lord, I pray that as we, as a local church, prepare for our missions conference, I pray

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:44.579
that our hearts will be soft and tender, receptive.

00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:53.739
I pray, God, that you would work in our midst, help us as individuals to purpose to be here.

00:21:53.739 --> 00:21:58.859
Lord, I pray for the missionaries and their families as they travel, that you would give

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:06.260
safety and give clarity and wisdom with regard to messages, and Lord, I pray that through

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:13.020
all that would be said and done, that you alone would be glorified, that we as thy people

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:19.339
would rejoice greatly as we have the privilege of hearing all that you're doing.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.420
We're excited.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.459
We have a great level of anticipation of how you'd work in our midst.

00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:29.459
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:22:29.459 --> 00:22:31.140
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:39.180
We thank you for the confidence that we have that you hear and answer prayer.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.180
I pray that you'd be glorified through the remainder of our service.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.739
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
