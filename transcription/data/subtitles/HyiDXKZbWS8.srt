1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
as we continue studying throughout these portions

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,960
of scripture, 1st and 2nd Timothy has been our study

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,840
for the calendar year 2024,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,239
as we have had our theme continue

5
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,620
and that we come to the 2nd to last chapter

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,000
and it's November, 1st Sunday in November,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,799
so we're right on schedule

8
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,120
and thankful to the Lord for his word.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,200
We begin looking at this portion of scripture,

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,479
2nd Timothy chapter three,

11
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,120
we're gonna look at verses one through nine this morning

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,000
and I wanna read just the first verse to you

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,479
and then we'll get right into the message.

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,119
The Bible says this,

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,840
this know also that in the last days

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,959
perilous times shall come.

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,840
I love the way that 2nd Timothy three begins

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,200
with these three words, this know also.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,720
Our God, who is eternal and who is omniscient

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,439
has given to us a preserved book, the Bible

21
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,040
and he has given to us within his word,

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,599
not only revelation with regard to who he is,

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,400
with how we approach him, how we can be saved

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
and how we can live to bring honor and glory to his name,

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,400
but he's given to us in his word information

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,919
that would enable us as his people, his children

27
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:23,120
to be informed and also to be prepared

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,739
and it's absolutely essential when we look at this phrase,

29
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,139
this know also, God wants his people to be informed.

30
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:32,819
He wants us to be aware and to be prepared

31
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,339
for what we will face and we find

32
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:36,860
that throughout the scriptures

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,419
that he'll use various terminologies

34
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,940
in order to communicate this truth to us at times.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,620
He says, I would not have you to be ignorant.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,540
I don't want you to have no knowledge of these things.

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,860
I want you to know these things

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,699
and so he begins as Timothy obviously is receiving

39
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,260
this letter from Paul,

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,760
but it's within this particular chapter of God's word

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,900
that God tells us it's the memory verse

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,379
for the month of November.

43
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:07,220
All scripture is given by inspiration of God

44
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,699
and is profitable.

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,740
I'm so thankful that God's word is profitable.

46
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,539
He goes on to tell us that it's profitable for what?

47
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,059
For doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

48
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,800
for instruction in righteousness,

49
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,360
that the man of God might be perfect,

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,960
throughly furnished unto all good works

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,440
and then he tells them, he gives them a charge

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
and then tells them in chapter four to preach the word.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,279
Why?

54
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,440
Because we know that it's God's word

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,960
and we know that it's inspired

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
and I'm thankful this morning

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,119
that it's been preserved for us

58
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,479
and that God's word is profitable.

59
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,199
He wants you and he wants me to be informed

60
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,000
with regard to the days in which we're living

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,039
and he wants us to be prepared.

62
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,279
We find that he says, this know also

63
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:56,179
that in the last days, perilous times shall come.

64
00:02:56,179 --> 00:03:00,199
The phrase last days is really an unspecified period of time

65
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,639
we know that it concludes with the return

66
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,759
of the Lord Jesus Christ for his bride.

67
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,639
Who's his bride?

68
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,320
Well, the church of the living God, amen

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,360
and I'm thankful that the church is the bride of Christ

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,740
and the church is not a building,

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,639
the church is the people

72
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,720
and the people make up the church.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,559
How?

74
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:23,520
Because we decided that we wanna join a church

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,160
and we filled out some membership.

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,479
No, no, no.

77
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,479
Yes, there's membership in a church

78
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,600
but what enables someone to be a member of a local church

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,360
is that they've been saved by the blood of Christ

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
and they've been scripturally baptized

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,399
and then they voluntarily make a decision

82
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:45,000
that I wanna be a member of this local church

83
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,880
and so we find that the prerequisites, if you will,

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,240
are salvation and baptism, scriptural baptism.

85
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,320
Baptism always in the scriptures,

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
if you study it, it always follows salvation.

87
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,380
Joel followed the Lord and believers baptism

88
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,039
last Sunday night, what a blessing.

89
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,199
I enjoy every time God gives me the opportunity

90
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,520
to baptize someone because they're making

91
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,960
that public identification

92
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,440
that I'm choosing to walk with Christ.

93
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,399
I have been saved and I wanna walk with Christ

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,359
and we find that he tells us that these last days,

95
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,920
those are the days in which we're living.

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,880
If I could say it to you this way this morning,

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,359
I believe that we're living in the last of the last days

98
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,899
and again, it's an unspecified period of time.

99
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,559
We just know that it ends at the return

100
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,279
of the Lord Jesus Christ for his bride

101
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,500
and then of course, that's the rapture,

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,880
the church is removed, you have seven years of tribulation

103
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,440
but notice what the Bible says in verse number one,

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,079
this know also that in the last days,

105
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,359
notice it says perilous times shall come.

106
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,600
That word perilous carries with it the idea

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,200
of being troublesome days, dangerous days.

108
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,079
It also carries with it the idea of being fierce days

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,179
and this word is used obviously,

110
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,000
every word of God is pure and we understand

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,359
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

112
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,880
and so he's giving us this information

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
so that we could be prepared, so that we could know

114
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,899
what it is that we're going to face.

115
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,440
The characteristics provided in this passage of scripture

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
are not only present today

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,959
but we find that they're increasing rapidly.

118
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,779
You see the increase of these characteristics

119
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,040
that are mentioned beginning in verse number two

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,279
and following through the text of scripture

121
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,320
and as you look at these characteristics

122
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,600
that are provided to us, we find they're present

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,079
in our society today but they're increasing rapidly.

124
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,440
It's amazing that even in my lifetime

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,899
and I'm not that old, I still consider myself

126
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,739
to be a young man and the reality is that in my lifetime,

127
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,380
I have seen the rapid increase

128
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,239
of these particular characteristics that God gives us

129
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:01,200
in this text of scripture in our society.

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,119
Paul mentioned this in first Timothy chapter four

131
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,179
and just turn back there just for a moment

132
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,820
before we dig in to second Timothy chapter three

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,339
and notice what Paul said in first Timothy four

134
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,299
in verse number one, Paul is of course,

135
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,720
this first letter to Timothy,

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,179
he's encouraging him to what?

137
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,500
To continue, why?

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,859
Because the things are difficult there in Ephesus,

139
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:24,779
there's false teachers and all the things that are going on

140
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,540
and he says to continue but notice in verse number one

141
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,459
of first Timothy four, now the spirit speaketh expressly

142
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,579
that in the latter times, notice,

143
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:36,940
some shall depart from the faith,

144
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,239
giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,

145
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,459
speaking lies and hypocrisy,

146
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,059
having their conscience seared with a hot iron,

147
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,700
forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,859
which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving

149
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,220
of them which believe and know the truth.

150
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,799
For every creature of God is good

151
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,179
and nothing to be refused

152
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:01,179
if it be received with thanksgiving

153
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:05,260
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,359
and so we find that in chapter number four of first Timothy,

155
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,779
Paul gives this opening really statement

156
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,140
and then elaborates extensively

157
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,959
in second Timothy chapter three

158
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,619
with regard to these last days in which we're living.

159
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:20,540
We find I've titled the message this morning

160
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,339
just simply this perilous times, perilous times.

161
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,179
You say pastor, I know, I see these things all around us,

162
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,260
I see what's going on,

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,399
I agree that we're living in the last times,

164
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,760
notice with me as we study through the passage

165
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,359
what God wants us to know.

166
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:38,119
First of all, note the description that God gives us.

167
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,679
Note the description beginning in verse number two

168
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,079
and I'm gonna go through this somewhat quickly

169
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,459
but I'm gonna touch on each of the characteristics

170
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,320
that God gives us as he defines or describes for us

171
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,459
the times that are mentioned in verse number one

172
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,619
as being perilous times.

173
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,279
There are 20 characteristics

174
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,760
that I have listed out this morning

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,359
and in verse number two,

176
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,320
we see the first eight of them provided.

177
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,600
The Bible says for men shall be lovers of their own selves,

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,559
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,

179
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:15,760
disobedient to parents, unthankful and unholy.

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,920
And we find that the scriptures continue

181
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,220
and it's just one characteristic after the next,

182
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,079
after the next, after the next.

183
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,040
Notice when he says lovers of their own selves,

184
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,500
carrying with it the idea of being selfish.

185
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,940
Is it hard for you to understand today

186
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,619
that we're living in a selfish culture in society,

187
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,380
that man is selfish and we see that

188
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,739
and he says men shall be lovers of their own selves.

189
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,140
He says the second characteristic in verse number two

190
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,000
is being covetous,

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,500
literally the idea of having a love for money or for things.

192
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,539
We're reminded in Exodus chapter 20

193
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,539
that the 10th commandment is that thou shalt not covet.

194
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,460
A number of things are listed specifically

195
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,859
in verse number 17,

196
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,619
but we find that he says that men shall not only be lovers

197
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:06,820
of their own selves, but they shall be covetous.

198
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,059
Listen, our marketing industry in this nation

199
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,179
and in many nations around the globe

200
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,859
knows that man is covetous.

201
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:17,619
They know that they can market their products

202
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:20,059
and they can tell you that you need this

203
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,020
and why, because we're covetous.

204
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,059
But what does God say?

205
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,340
We're to be content with such things as we have,

206
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,659
that we are to learn, as Paul said,

207
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,739
I have learned in what sort of state I am there with

208
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,859
to be content.

209
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:38,619
Listen, I'm thankful that Jesus satisfies, amen?

210
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,919
Listen, the reality is that the things of this world,

211
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,780
according to 1 John chapter number two,

212
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,260
are going to pass away, amen?

213
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,739
The things of this world are gonna pass away.

214
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,380
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world

215
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,940
is what the Bible tells us

216
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,859
and it then says a verse later

217
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,820
that the things of the world will pass away,

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,099
but he that doeth the will

219
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:07,699
the Father abideth forever." And we can rejoice this morning that Jesus satisfies. There's a

220
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,379
people today in our society, they're so covetous and they're trying to satisfy by getting things

221
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:21,219
and having more, and they find that it never truly satisfies. Why? Because there's always

222
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:24,659
something newer, there's always something better, there's always something bigger,

223
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:30,899
but we find that Jesus, He satisfies. And men shall be lovers of their own selves,

224
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:37,859
they shall be covetous boasters, it tells us in verse number two. Literally, the idea of an empty

225
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:44,579
pretender, someone that's boasting about how good they are, and we see the connection with pride,

226
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,939
the very next one is proud, and we find that God, we must remember God hates pride.

227
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,419
The Bible tells us that God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

228
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:03,779
These six things doth the Lord hate. Proud, pride, a proud look is there in the text of

229
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,499
Scripture in the book of Proverbs, only by pride cometh contention. Listen, we live in a society

230
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:18,739
full of people that are proud. We find that the next one is blasphemers, literally speaking evil

231
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:27,539
or slanderers. Man, the thing of slander is all around us today, and we see these that would speak

232
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,899
evil, disobedient to parents. Do you see it at the end of verse number two? Now think about this,

233
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:39,459
disobedient to parents. I have remember a time, of course, as I was growing up, I remember the

234
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:45,779
importance of obedience to my parents, and the great consequences of disobedience to my parents,

235
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,139
but it's amazing to me that sometimes, listen, if you go out in public and you see families and

236
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,899
you can witness the disobedience of children, that's just like, listen, the kids are ruling

237
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:04,419
the home. It really is the case. The kids are ruling the home. Children, obey your parents

238
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:10,259
and the Lord for this is right. Amen? That's what the Bible tells us in Ephesians chapter number six,

239
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:18,339
but we find this characteristic of disobedient to parents unthankful. Oh man, why do we have in

240
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,939
our society today a lack of thankfulness? I believe that we could say it this way, it's because we have

241
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:28,819
an entitled generation. You know what an entitled generation thinks? They think they deserve

242
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:34,419
something, that they're owed something, and therefore they're not thankful. Can I tell you

243
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:39,059
this morning that as God's people, we ought to be a thankful people. I understand the month of thanks

244
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:45,939
of November in our nation, the holiday of thanksgiving, but listen, we're not thankful

245
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:51,939
just because of a day on our calendar. We're to give thanks always for all things. This is God's

246
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:57,379
will for us, and we understand that we're to be a thankful people. Everything I have, everything that

247
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:03,299
you have is because of the good hand of God, but we live in a society that's unthankful.

248
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,139
And then it ends in verse number two by saying unholy, profane, and wicked.

249
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:15,859
Profane and wicked is what it means. Verse number three gives us six additional characteristics.

250
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:22,179
Notice with me, without natural affection, truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,

251
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:32,019
despisers of those that are good. The first one, without natural affection, literally inhumane

252
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:41,699
or careless. You know, it's an understood thing that we would have some natural human kindness,

253
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:48,019
that we would care one for another, but we live in a society where there's no natural affection.

254
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:54,339
Sometimes we talk about the natural love of a mother for her child, and we talk about that,

255
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:00,179
and we understand that, we've experienced that, but he says that these days are characterized

256
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:06,899
as those that have no natural affection. They're truth breakers, and they lack integrity. There's

257
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:13,939
no honesty. I remember reading statistics several years ago during a previous presidential campaign

258
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:20,899
election season, and they asked the question, how important was honesty? And less than 50 percent

259
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,819
of the people polled in the particular poll said that honesty mattered to them. And I shook my

260
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:32,579
head as I read that particular study and thought, how can half of the people that are polled not

261
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:41,619
care whether or not the individual's telling the truth? It tells us that they're false accusers.

262
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:47,299
Again, similar to what we looked at with blasphemers, they slander. They bring those

263
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,899
false accusations. By the way, many times those false accusations will come against the people of

264
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,939
God. Is that not what happened to Stephen? You read Acts chapter number six and seven,

265
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:02,739
and they suborned men. They got people together, and they brought these false accusations

266
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:08,819
against Stephen. Is that not what happened to our Lord and to our Savior? They brought these false

267
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:16,019
accusations, and we find that these last days will be characterized as those that are false accusers.

268
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:23,299
Incontinent, it means to have no self-control. No self-control. You know, we live in a society

269
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,579
where people don't have self-control. I mean, you just go out just a little bit. I mean,

270
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:35,859
you can see all around us there's no self-control. They just do what they want, how they want. They

271
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:42,499
don't care. And we find that it tells us, number five, there within the third verse, that they're

272
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:50,499
fierce. Literally the idea of being a savage. If you read some of the stuff that's gone on in

273
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:56,419
America in recent years, with some of the crime that's gone on, some of the things that is taking

274
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:05,059
place, it is literally savage. It is fierce. It's a situation where we've seen and we've heard

275
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:11,379
about individuals that have committed such wicked crimes, and many times you can read,

276
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,499
you can see videos of those that were just walking down a sidewalk when they're blasted

277
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:24,179
from behind. I mean, elderly people that used to be respected in a society, and it's sad what's

278
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:33,139
happening. He tells us at the end of verse number three, despisers of those that are good. I think

279
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:38,099
that the reason that they despise those that are good, and remember that we could think about the

280
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:45,379
truth as we mentioned last week, that only God is good, but I'm thankful that Paul says that he

281
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:52,979
understood that he was what he was by the grace of God, and God allows us to do good works for him.

282
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:59,299
We don't do good work so that we can be saved or so that we can stay saved, but we are out of being

283
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:04,259
saved. We're to do good works, but why is it that they're despisers of those that are good? Well,

284
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:10,739
I believe that it's lest their evil deeds be exposed. In John chapter number three, the Bible

285
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:17,459
tells us this in verse number 20 with regard to this thought of those that are despisers of that

286
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,539
which is good, and in John chapter three, notice with me, just turn there quickly, in John chapter

287
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:29,379
number three, we're familiar with much of this chapter in the interaction with Nicodemus and the

288
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:35,299
wonderful proclamation of John 3 16 and all that takes place, but notice in verse number 20,

289
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:43,939
the Bible says, for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light. Why? And then it says, neither

290
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:52,019
cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved. I've often mentioned, and we study,

291
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,139
and we talk about this truth of separation. You know what I've learned about separation?

292
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:02,499
It really doesn't mean that so often that I have to separate from others. If I'm living

293
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:09,379
godly and living right, they'll separate from me. It's how it works. They don't want to run around

294
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:15,859
with you if you're living right and doing right and you're living godly. Why? Because the light

295
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:24,179
exposes their evil deeds. Back in second Timothy chapter three, we find that as we come to verse

296
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:32,419
number four, he gives us four additional characteristics. He says, traitors, heady, high-minded,

297
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:40,419
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. The idea of being a traitor, a betrayer. The idea

298
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:46,579
of being heady is to be rash or to be reckless. The idea of being high-minded is to be so blinded

299
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:53,539
by pride and can see that you cannot even see the truth. And then it ends with verse number four

300
00:18:53,539 --> 00:19:01,539
saying, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. The Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 11 that

301
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:07,059
there's pleasure in sin for a season. But when you compare Scripture with Scripture and you understand

302
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:13,139
all of the truth, the Bible tells us that judgment day will one day come. The Bible tells us that the

303
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:21,059
way of transgressors is hard. And we find that there are many that as we consider today the

304
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:27,059
environment, the culture in which we live, that they're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of

305
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:35,459
God. Even those that would profess out of a side of their mouth that we love Jesus, when you really

306
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:42,579
examine, you would find that they love pleasure more than they love God. It's a sad reality.

307
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:49,539
We come to verse number five. And verse five and six really only give us one characteristic. And

308
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:55,380
I've taken these verses and given this characteristic. In verse five it says,

309
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,859
having a form of godliness but denying the truth.

310
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:07,459
the power thereof from such turn away, a form of godliness, a fake, a fraud, an imposter."

311
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:13,659
You know there's a lot of things today that would claim to be religious.

312
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,859
Can I tell you that religion condemns.

313
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:17,859
Religion condemns.

314
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:22,299
I was reading, I mentioned in John chapter number 3 when you think about Nicodemus, you

315
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,299
know what Nicodemus was?

316
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,619
He was a religious man, but you know religion couldn't save Nicodemus.

317
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,499
Nicodemus was religious.

318
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:36,859
He comes to Jesus by night and Jesus says, you must be born again.

319
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:39,879
Your religion is not going to save you.

320
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,559
Religion blinds people.

321
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,659
Religion sells a bill of goods.

322
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,739
Religion tries to get man to approach God, but it says here, having a form of godliness

323
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,699
but denying the power thereof from such turn away.

324
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:58,699
We find that when we consider not only Nicodemus in John chapter number 3, but you could consider

325
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,299
Cornelius in Acts chapter number 10.

326
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,979
Cornelius was a devout man.

327
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:09,099
Cornelius was a man that prayed, that gave to church, that fasted.

328
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:15,619
I mean Cornelius, if we could talk about a religious man, Cornelius fits the bill.

329
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,619
But guess what?

330
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,099
Cornelius was lost.

331
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:24,339
Cornelius sees a vision and that vision, by the way, doesn't save Cornelius.

332
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:27,659
There's some people that have this idea, well I saw, how do you know you're going to heaven?

333
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,539
Well, I saw this vision.

334
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,699
No, no, no.

335
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:35,579
Be careful because the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians that Satan turns himself into

336
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:42,899
an angel of light and he's the deceiver and in Acts chapter number 10, Cornelius does

337
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:43,899
receive a vision.

338
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,659
But you know what the vision tells Cornelius?

339
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,859
Go and find Peter and Peter's going to tell you what to do or what you need to know in

340
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,659
order to be saved.

341
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:56,459
And it's amazing because he obeys the vision he sends for Peter.

342
00:21:56,459 --> 00:22:01,059
By the way, God's working at the same time in Peter's life because God gives Peter a

343
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,299
vision so that Peter will obey when these people come.

344
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,419
He says, go with them, nothing doubting, that's what he tells them.

345
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:13,779
And Peter goes and you know what Peter finds when he gets there?

346
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,819
Cornelius has not only himself, but he's got a group of people assembled saying, hey,

347
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:22,539
the angel said to send for you and you were going to tell us how to be saved.

348
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:23,539
You know what Peter does?

349
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,059
He preaches the gospel.

350
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,059
What's the gospel?

351
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,859
The death, burial, and resurrection.

352
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:34,819
There was nothing that those people, the religion that they had, that Cornelius, those religious

353
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,059
practices, they could not save him.

354
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:42,519
It was Jesus Christ and his substitutionary atonement and his glorious resurrection.

355
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,679
And so we find today that we live in a society where there's a form of godliness, there's

356
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,239
church all over the place.

357
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:54,879
I spoke to the fellow that pastors the church that was at the retreat that we did or the

358
00:22:54,879 --> 00:23:00,999
conference, the marriage conference this past weekend, and he said, listen, in our county

359
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:06,439
there's about 70,000 people in our county where they are in West Virginia, and in a

360
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:13,399
county with 70,000 people, there's nearly 200 churches.

361
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:17,759
Every kind of flavor and denomination you can think of.

362
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,439
There's such wickedness.

363
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:25,439
I won't even share it from the pulpit, but Holly shared with me a clip yesterday from

364
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:33,079
a so-called religious leader of a denomination standing in the pulpit and redefining how

365
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:39,759
Jesus would give the beatitudes if he was preaching today, and it was absolutely blasphemous,

366
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,759
wicked.

367
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,639
But yet people go to churches like that.

368
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,079
They've strayed from this book.

369
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,039
There's a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.

370
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,919
I'm thankful that our God has all power and he's given us power.

371
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,799
I'm thankful that he said that we, when we have the, when we're filled with the Holy

372
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,119
Spirit of God, that we have that power, that boldness, and what a blessing.

373
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,559
Listen, there's many things.

374
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,159
Our enemy is a deceiver.

375
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,159
He's a fraud.

376
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,919
He's an imposter.

377
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,719
And his desire, according to 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, is to keep as many people

378
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,759
blinded from the truth as possible.

379
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,759
The truth is powerful.

380
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,559
We're going to look at that in just a moment, but he wants people to be blinded.

381
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,319
Notice the final characteristic that's given to us in verse number 6.

382
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:45,199
I've simply talked, I've kind of summed up verse number 6 this way, gross immorality.

383
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:49,159
Let me use this word, it's a Bible word, lasciviousness.

384
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,199
The Bible says in the book of Jude that they turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

385
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,479
You know what lasciviousness means?

386
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,399
It means unbridled lust.

387
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:04,319
And we see the gross immorality in verse number 6, and now in these verses of Scripture from

388
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,279
verse 2 to verse number 6, we find that there are 20 characteristics that God gives us that

389
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,879
really reveal to us and define for us the depravity of man.

390
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:19,119
Romans chapter number 1, we don't have time to go through it this morning, but Romans

391
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,079
chapter number 1 is such a powerful passage of Scripture that defines and describes for

392
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,399
us a day in which we're living.

393
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:32,519
And we find this morning the description that is provided to us, number 2, as we continue

394
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,079
to study through these verses of Scripture, notice with me, their deception.

395
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,719
We see their description in verses 2 through 6, but in verses 7 and 8 we see their deception.

396
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:48,359
We find that in verse number 7, the Bible says, ever learning and never able to come

397
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,459
to the knowledge of the truth.

398
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:57,000
We find that knowledge has increased exponentially in our society today.

399
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,659
You begin to think about those that have been able to make such discoveries in all that

400
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:07,019
is taking place, and we find that knowledge has increased, but they really do not know

401
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,939
the truth.

402
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,339
They do not know the truth.

403
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:17,059
In fact, Romans 1 and verse 22 says, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

404
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,259
We find that knowledge increaseth.

405
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:24,179
By the way, Daniel speaks of that, talking about that same period of time in which we're

406
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,059
dealing with this morning from this text of Scripture.

407
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,979
But I want you to think about their deception, and though they're ever learning, but the

408
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:35,619
Bible says, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

409
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:36,619
Why?

410
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:41,859
Because they deny the truth with a capital T. They deny Jesus Christ.

411
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:49,979
And we find that the devil, Satan, he is a liar and he is a deceiver.

412
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:56,859
John 8 in verse 44, the Bible tells us of this truth with regard to our enemy, and notice

413
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:01,939
how he describes the enemy of God's people.

414
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:05,679
In John 8 in verse number 44, Jesus says this.

415
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,099
He says to these religious leaders, and by the way, they're attacking him, and speaking

416
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,819
of which he was born of fornication, according to verse number 41, and we know that that's

417
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:22,779
not true, and we know the miracle of the birth, the incarnation of Christ, and he says in

418
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:28,419
verse 44, ye are of your father the devil, and the lust of your father you will do.

419
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:33,579
He was a murderer from the beginning, and a bode not in the truth, because there is

420
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,979
no truth in him.

421
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:43,099
When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar, and the father of it.

422
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:48,899
We think about the truth of this portion of Scripture with regard to the deception.

423
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:52,579
We see how they're described, but then we see their deception.

424
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:58,259
We find that in verse 13 of text, and we'll focus primarily on this section next Sunday

425
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,539
morning, but you notice that the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3 in verse 13, but evil men and

426
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,859
seducers shall wax worse and worse.

427
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:10,059
That's what it says, deceiving and being deceived.

428
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:14,099
And then God gives us an illustration of this deception in verse number 8.

429
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,899
We find in verse number 7, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the

430
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:24,719
truth, and then in verse number 80 he says, now as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses,

431
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,039
so do these also resist the truth.

432
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:33,459
Men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith.

433
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:37,739
When we come to verse number 8, we find that God is going to illustrate for us the level

434
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:44,219
of deception that we would face in this particular time of the last days, these perilous times,

435
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:49,739
and we find that he begins to introduce us to these individuals, Janice and Jambres.

436
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:54,500
Now we don't know who these people are with 100% certainty.

437
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,659
It's the only time you're going to find their names in the Scripture.

438
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:03,899
However, both of these names do have Egyptian origin.

439
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:09,579
And with them having Egyptian origin and understanding where the Bible says they're in the text

440
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:15,500
that they withstood Moses, we believe that though these names are only found here and

441
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:22,059
they're not given to us by name in the record of the book of Exodus, we believe this morning

442
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:29,099
that these are two Egyptian magicians during that time of the plagues.

443
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:35,219
Because specifically, he says as Janice and Jambres, what do they do, withstood Moses.

444
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:42,339
So again, these names being of Egyptian origin and going back and considering in your mind

445
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:45,099
the way in which they withstood Moses.

446
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:50,539
And so we think about those magicians, those Egyptian magicians during that time in which

447
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,779
God had called Moses to go stand before Pharaoh and say, what, let my people go.

448
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,940
So go back, if you will, to Exodus chapter number 7.

449
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,620
and we're gonna begin looking here

450
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,740
and I want you to see the deception

451
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,980
because God is using this illustration

452
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,660
from all the way back in the book of Exodus

453
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,500
to help us understand that in these last days,

454
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,520
remember he started this know also

455
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,820
that in the last days, perilous time shall come.

456
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,680
He talks about their description,

457
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,660
he provides it for us, but then their deception

458
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,380
and he uses these two individuals as an example

459
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,900
and notice it says this, that they also resist the truth.

460
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,980
In Exodus chapter number seven,

461
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,940
God was going to use Moses and Aaron in a great way.

462
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,280
We find that Pharaoh upon the original interaction

463
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,780
when Moses goes and says that God said let my people go,

464
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,120
Pharaoh's like I don't know who your God is,

465
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,980
why should I obey, why should I let you go?

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,080
Well, I believe that over the next series of events

467
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,800
that what God did was in no uncertain terms

468
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,800
revealed himself to Pharaoh and to all of the Egyptians.

469
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,639
I believe if you were to study and dig deep into it

470
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,120
that you can find that every single plague

471
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,440
was a direct attack upon an Egyptian false god.

472
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,860
And so you begin to look as you understand

473
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,560
and brother Jeff mentioned this

474
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,520
in Sunday school this morning,

475
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,959
what was it that Moses had?

476
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,279
He had a rod.

477
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,600
And we begin reading in chapter number seven

478
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,480
in verse number eight,

479
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,000
the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,360
when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying,

481
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,639
show a miracle for you,

482
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,400
then thou shalt say unto Aaron,

483
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,700
take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh

484
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,600
and it shall become a serpent.

485
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,680
And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh

486
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,279
and they did so as the Lord had commanded

487
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,580
and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh

488
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,860
and before his servants and it became a serpent.

489
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,080
I've often said, as I read this passage of scripture,

490
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,300
I am thankful that I was not Moses or Aaron, amen.

491
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,940
And he tells them to cast that rod down

492
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,580
and it became a serpent.

493
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,460
But notice what happens.

494
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,419
The Bible says in verse number 11,

495
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:15,380
then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers.

496
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,220
Now the magicians of Egypt,

497
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,220
they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

498
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,760
For they cast down every man, verse number 12, his rod,

499
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,160
and they became serpents.

500
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,199
Then it says, but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

501
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:39,460
And even though Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods,

502
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,440
it does not end there.

503
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,919
We find that as you continue to travel

504
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,440
through these pages of scripture in the book of Exodus

505
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,779
and consider the plagues in chapter seven

506
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,660
and verse number 22, the Bible says that the magicians

507
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,979
of Egypt did so with their enchantments.

508
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,580
They imitated that first plague

509
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,000
of the water being turned to blood.

510
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,119
We find that in chapter number eight,

511
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,720
when we find the second plague, that of frogs,

512
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,900
I've never understood as I've read

513
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,419
through Exodus chapter number eight,

514
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,979
why the magicians in verse number seven

515
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:12,699
did so with their enchantments

516
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,300
and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

517
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,919
They already had enough frogs

518
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,240
and yet they are trying to deceive

519
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,800
and they show that they too can bring up frogs.

520
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,500
It's great deception.

521
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,660
The Bible says in chapter eight, in verse number 18,

522
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:36,279
this is the third plague, that of lice,

523
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,960
and the Bible says in verse number 18,

524
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,720
and the magicians did so with their enchantments,

525
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,680
notice what it says, to bring forth lice.

526
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,680
But then notice the next words, but they could not.

527
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:53,619
Kind of became the end of the road for them.

528
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,940
They were imitating, they were deceiving,

529
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,580
and they imitated that the rods turned to serpents,

530
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,619
they imitated the first plague

531
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:05,500
and they made that water turn to blood,

532
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,320
they imitated the second with bringing more frogs,

533
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,059
but then in the third plague,

534
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,880
when they used their enchantments to bring forth lice,

535
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,820
the Bible says that they could not,

536
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,299
so there were lice upon man and upon beast,

537
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,220
and then it tells us in verse 19,

538
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,679
then the magician said unto Pharaoh,

539
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,679
notice what they say, this is the finger of God.

540
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,179
And Pharaoh's heart was hardened

541
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,619
and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had said.

542
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,299
And so we find that they tried to bring more,

543
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:37,380
but they could not,

544
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,019
they recognized that it was the finger of God,

545
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,279
as the magicians, as the imitators,

546
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:45,320
as those that were resisting the truth,

547
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,720
and they were seeking to deceive the masses.

548
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,880
Think about the scene in Egypt at this time,

549
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,839
and all that was taking place in the court of Pharaoh.

550
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,839
We come to the ninth chapter,

551
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,000
and we find that these magicians,

552
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,320
they were also impacted according to verse number 11,

553
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,679
by the boils, the sixth plague.

554
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,660
The Bible says in Exodus 9 and verse number 11,

555
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,040
and the magicians could not stand before Moses

556
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,959
because of the boils,

557
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,580
for the boil was upon the magicians

558
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,420
and upon all the Egyptians.

559
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,179
Literally, pus filled open and running sores.

560
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,700
The Bible tells us that these magicians,

561
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,860
as they sought to imitate,

562
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,980
that they were doing these things,

563
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,160
but then they come to the place where,

564
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
in chapter 10 and verse number seven,

565
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,360
they say to Pharaoh,

566
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,679
and Pharaoh's servants said unto him,

567
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,080
how long shall this man be a snare unto us?

568
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,760
Let the men go that they may serve the Lord their God.

569
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

570
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,119
It's very interesting,

571
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,959
we don't have time,

572
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,559
and over the next several months,

573
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,080
as we study through the book of Revelation,

574
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,920
we'll notice this,

575
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,559
but even during the time of the tribulation,

576
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,660
the time of the tribulation is gonna be

577
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,600
a period of great deception.

578
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,899
And we find that even though men will suffer greatly,

579
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:13,860
you know what the Bible tells us?

580
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,000
They won't repent.

581
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
They'll suffer greatly,

582
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,119
but they won't repent.

583
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,619
We find here that these magicians,

584
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,299
they recognize these things to be true,

585
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:24,420
they've imitated,

586
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,339
they've deceived,

587
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,920
but now they're being impacted and affected,

588
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,380
but we see nowhere that they actually are going to repent.

589
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,880
If we go back to the truth of this deception,

590
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,559
and we understand the truth in 2 Timothy chapter number three

591
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,200
with regard to these that are mentioned,

592
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,839
that they're ever learning and never able

593
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,160
to come to the knowledge of the truth,

594
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,000
in verse eight,

595
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,279
now as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses,

596
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:53,920
so do these also resist the truth.

597
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Now I want you to understand this thought

598
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,899
in verse number eight,

599
00:36:56,899 --> 00:37:00,399
when it talks about they resist the truth.

600
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,500
It's not that they do not have the truth,

601
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,059
it's not that the truth is not available to them,

602
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,540
it's not that someone's not spoken the truth,

603
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,019
it's that they resist the truth.

604
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,860
Reminds me of what the Bible says

605
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,239
in 2 Peter chapter number three,

606
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,380
when it says of this,

607
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,059
they were willingly ignorant.

608
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,059
It's sad to me,

609
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,179
but there are many today

610
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,380
that simply do not want to know the truth.

611
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,080
They've been deceived by the enemy

612
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,480
through whatever means they've been deceived,

613
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,559
and they're absolutely content being deceived,

614
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,959
and they don't want anyone to mess with their thoughts

615
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,760
with regard to the truth.

616
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,260
They resist the truth,

617
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,140
they are willingly ignorant of these things

618
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,339
according to 2 Peter chapter number three.

619
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,239
This morning as we consider the deception,

620
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,299
I'm reminded of 2 Corinthians 11,

621
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,799
would you take your Bibles and turn there with me,

622
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,140
and I want you to see what God tells us

623
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,260
in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11

624
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,860
with regard to the deception

625
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,260
and the age in which we live,

626
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,239
and understanding that this know also

627
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,500
that in the last days perilous times shall come.

628
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,940
The description is given,

629
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,739
but then we're understood,

630
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,860
or we understand the truth of deception.

631
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,940
And notice with me in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11,

632
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,160
I begin reading in verse number 13,

633
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,000
2 Corinthians 11 and verse number 13,

634
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,440
the Bible says, for such are false apostles,

635
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,200
deceitful workers, transforming themselves

636
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,039
into the apostles of Christ.

637
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,000
It's a staggering verse.

638
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,720
It's a verse of scripture that calls us

639
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,520
to just kind of stop and understand

640
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,159
that there are those that are active,

641
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,380
these false teachers,

642
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,419
and here it talks about false apostles,

643
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:58,059
deceitful workers, and what do they do?

644
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:02,299
They transform themselves into the apostles of Christ.

645
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,239
Listen, what we know to be true

646
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,640
of false teachers and false apostles today

647
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,159
as we've studied 1 and 2 Timothy up to this point,

648
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,340
as you look at various other portions of scripture,

649
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,900
the book of 2 Peter giving us great insight,

650
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,780
Jude providing great insight,

651
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,020
we find that the false teacher,

652
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,520
the false apostle doesn't show up with a sign on

653
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,039
that says I'm a false teacher.

654
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,720
No, it'd be too easy for us to identify.

655
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:35,919
They transform themselves into the apostles of Christ.

656
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:38,559
I've said this before, that they use our vocabulary,

657
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,919
but not our dictionary.

658
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,500
They'll use the same kind of words that we're familiar with,

659
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,679
but they don't mean by those words

660
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,760
the same things that we mean by those words.

661
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,260
We're singing this morning saved

662
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,340
by the blood of the crucified one.

663
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,220
It's a wonderful song.

664
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,900
And we say, as I stood here

665
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,500
at the beginning of the service.

666
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,200
and I said, there's only one way to be saved,

667
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,339
and that's through the blood of the crucified one.

668
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:05,579
But we understand, listen,

669
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,880
when you and I use that term saved,

670
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,539
we understand what we mean by that.

671
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,520
If someone were to ask me, are you saved?

672
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,119
And I say, yes, I'm saved.

673
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,219
I'm answering that question understanding

674
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:20,700
that I was lost on my way to a Christless eternity.

675
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,219
I was helpless and I was hopeless.

676
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:28,500
I was dead spiritually in my sins.

677
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,959
And I was in need of the only savior,

678
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,900
the Lord Jesus Christ.

679
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,599
The Bible says that Jesus said,

680
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,900
"'I am the way, the truth, and the life.

681
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,479
"'No man cometh unto the Father but by me.'

682
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,720
"'Peter proclaims, there's no other name under heaven,

683
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,459
"'given among men, whereby we must be saved.'

684
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:50,080
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'

685
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
"'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,

686
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,599
"'and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.'"

687
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,520
Listen, the word saved is a Bible word.

688
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,599
You know what happens in Acts 15?

689
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,119
There's these that are going out and saying,

690
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,559
hey, they cannot be saved, it's the word they use,

691
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,959
except they be circumcised after the manner of Moses.

692
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,339
No, no, no, no, that's false, that's false teaching.

693
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,919
You read Acts chapter 15, there's a council that assembles,

694
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,959
there's a debate that ensues,

695
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,000
and we find that they get it straight.

696
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,800
And in fact, they stand in Acts 15

697
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,440
and they make this declaration.

698
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,480
What a great declaration they make.

699
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,480
In verse number 11,

700
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,660
"'For we believe that through the grace

701
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,660
"'of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even as they.'"

702
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Praise the Lord, they got it right.

703
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,419
They were false teachers.

704
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:42,599
They were dealt with, they were exposed.

705
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,699
But you know that there are some

706
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:46,980
that would use the same word,

707
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,300
but they mean something different by it.

708
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,419
They mean maybe that they were baptized as an infant.

709
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:55,779
They mean maybe that they did some religious exercise

710
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,599
of whatever level it had to be.

711
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,160
Maybe it's that they partook of the Lord's Supper.

712
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,959
And they think that by doing those things that they're saved.

713
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:06,720
No, that's not what the Bible teaches about salvation.

714
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,080
And so we find that there are those that would stand

715
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,119
and they would profess to be the apostles of Christ,

716
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,399
but we find that the Bible says

717
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:19,000
that they're deceitful workers.

718
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,399
They're false apostles.

719
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:25,520
Everything must be lined up with the truth of this book.

720
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:30,619
We find in 1 John that the Bible says, try the spirits.

721
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,539
How do we do that?

722
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,259
Well, we take their message

723
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,500
and look at what God has given us.

724
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,259
We're Bereans and we search the scriptures

725
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,339
and we say if these things are so.

726
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,500
Notice the text continues in verse number 14,

727
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,100
and no marvel in 2 Corinthians 11 and verse 14,

728
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,100
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,479
Therefore, it is no great thing

730
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,520
if his ministers also be transformed

731
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,440
as the ministers of righteousness,

732
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,320
whose end shall be according to their works.

733
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,800
This morning, there's a lot of false teaching.

734
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,679
There's a lot of deception that's going on.

735
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,679
The enemy wants to deceive people.

736
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:18,699
The enemy is perfectly fine with someone believing a lie.

737
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,919
The enemy is perfectly fine

738
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,699
with someone doing religious exercise,

739
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,100
but not being saved.

740
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,660
The enemy is perfectly content with it,

741
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,119
because they've been blinded to the truth of the gospel.

742
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:39,500
If righteousness could come by the law,

743
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,100
then Christ is dead in vain.

744
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,259
And we know that he did not die in vain.

745
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,139
And this morning, we can rejoice in knowing

746
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,039
that though there's great deception

747
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,419
that God has given to us the truth.

748
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:54,899
We notice our final thought

749
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,240
from 2 Timothy chapter three this morning.

750
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,660
We see number one, their description.

751
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,339
We see number two, their deception.

752
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,380
But we see number three, their doom.

753
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,580
In verse number nine, it says,

754
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,880
but they shall proceed no further,

755
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,619
for their folly shall be manifest unto all men

756
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,619
as theirs also was.

757
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,739
Can I tell you this morning

758
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:23,679
that error will collapse on itself.

759
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,320
It cannot stand the test.

760
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:31,399
Listen, truth, however, remains.

761
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:36,239
I'm thankful that truth will stand the test of time,

762
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,920
that we have in our hands the very truth of God's word.

763
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,839
He said, sanctify them through thy word.

764
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,299
Thy word is truth.

765
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,200
And we can rejoice this morning

766
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,019
in knowing that God has given to us the truth,

767
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:54,179
and that in the midst of these last days,

768
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:57,179
in the midst of understanding all that's taking place

769
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:59,700
and understanding the description that is given

770
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,820
and the deception that is there,

771
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,179
that we understand their doom

772
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,339
and God has given to us truth.

773
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,200
Can I say this?

774
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,779
It doesn't make us any better or privileged.

775
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:16,179
It makes us responsible to share the truth,

776
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,079
to proclaim the truth,

777
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,859
to stand boldly for the truth of God's word.

778
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,040
As I think about their doom,

779
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm thinking about specifically the leaders and the enemy,

780
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:32,839
the one who is controlling them

781
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,660
and giving to them these false things

782
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,140
and thinking about our enemy.

783
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,640
Notice in Revelation 19, the Bible says this,

784
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,440
and we'll look at two verses, three verses or so here

785
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,040
in the book of Revelation.

786
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:47,739
In Revelation 19,

787
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,260
in verse number 20, the Bible says,

788
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,519
and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet

789
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,500
that wrought miracles before him

790
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,980
with which he deceived them

791
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,700
that had received the mark of the beast

792
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,899
and them that worshiped his image.

793
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:10,940
These both, speaking of the false prophet

794
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,920
and the beast there,

795
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,859
these both were cast alive

796
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:17,359
into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

797
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:21,660
That's the doom of the beast and the false prophet

798
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,859
in chapter 20.

799
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,420
In verse number two, the Bible says,

800
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,019
and he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent,

801
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:31,859
which is the devil and Satan and bound him 1,000 years.

802
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:34,579
We know that it tells us that he would be loosed

803
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:37,579
for a little season according to verse number seven,

804
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:38,739
but then notice, if you will,

805
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,100
in verse number 10 of Revelation 20,

806
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,559
the Bible says, and the devil that deceived them,

807
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,160
did you notice in chapter 20, excuse me, 19 in verse 20,

808
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,640
that it talked about the deception?

809
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,000
And then again, in chapter 20 in verse number 10,

810
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,679
it talks about the deception,

811
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,000
and the devil that deceived them

812
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,119
was cast in the lake of fire and brimstone

813
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,600
where the beast and the false prophet are

814
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,920
and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.

815
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,040
That's when the enemy will finally,

816
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,059
once and for all, be banished.

817
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,320
The very sad thing for me is that following

818
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,420
that text of scripture in Revelation 20 in verse 10

819
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,399
is the scene of the great white throne judgment.

820
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:21,000
You know, today there are many people

821
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,059
that have been deceived by the enemy.

822
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:27,959
They've been deceived by the enemy, they're lost.

823
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:30,820
And according to that following text of scripture,

824
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,679
they too will be cast in the lake of fire and brimstone.

825
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,559
And that's a sad thing.

826
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,100
We understand the truth of the gospel,

827
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,660
we understand as we went through the various aspects

828
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,839
of the message this morning that we have been allowed,

829
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,339
blessed to have received the gospel

830
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:53,019
and to be saved by the grace of God,

831
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:56,600
and then been given the privilege to share that with others.

832
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,859
When I think about their doom as it's mentioned

833
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:02,899
in 2 Timothy 3 in verse number nine,

834
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:05,739
I'm not rejoicing in the doom of the individuals,

835
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,559
I'm rejoicing in the doom of our enemy, Satan,

836
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,200
the beast and the false prophet,

837
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,179
but my heart goes out for those

838
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:14,179
that have been deceived by him.

839
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,480
Because God has given to us an opportunity

840
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,820
to share the truth.

841
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:24,079
As we go through the next text of scripture

842
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,480
and we could not deal with all of 2 Timothy chapter three

843
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,119
in one message this morning,

844
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,920
with all of the characteristics that are given

845
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,359
and all of that, but we find that as we continue

846
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,260
to proceed in the next verses, what does God tell us?

847
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,039
He tells us to continue,

848
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:43,880
that even though we're living in these last days

849
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,859
and even though all these things are happening,

850
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,239
what are we to continue to do?

851
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,880
Well, we're to continue to go forth

852
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,320
and to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

853
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:54,880
We don't throw in the towel and say,

854
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,640
well, look at all these characteristics of what's going on,

855
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,159
look at what's the deception and so on and so forth.

856
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,539
No, truth stands.

857
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:09,320
Error and lies will fall, it'll be exposed,

858
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,239
but truth stands.

859
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,799
And we have a great responsibility

860
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:15,760
as we think about these last days that we live in.

861
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,280
I've heard many over the years say,

862
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,440
man, I wish I lived in,

863
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,159
they would mention some different period of time.

864
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,719
Can I tell you, I think it's a wonderful thing

865
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,320
that we get to live in the last days.

866
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,159
Why?

867
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,599
Because we get to see what God's able to do

868
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,900
in our generation.

869
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,760
We've seen what God was able to do in previous generations

870
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,760
recorded for us in his scripture,

871
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,919
and then throughout the pages of history of church

872
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:38,460
for the last 2000 years.

873
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,039
But this is now our opportunity, this is our time.

874
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,280
I'm not gonna wish that I lived in some other era

875
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,119
of human history.

876
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,000
No, I'm gonna rejoice that God's put me here when he has,

877
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,640
and that I have an opportunity to stand for truth

878
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,599
and to stand in those last days and the evil times,

879
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,119
and to understand that we're to go

880
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,320
in the whole armor of God,

881
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,400
and we're to go with the truth, the word of God.

882
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,920
This morning, we live in perilous times.

883
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,860
We live in the last days, but can I remind you that God's on His throne, and God wants

884
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,560
to use you this morning for His honor and for His glory.

885
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,440
He wants to use you in the place where you are.

886
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,240
He wants to use you in the midst of the people that you interact with.

887
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:30,080
You're a light, and the light shines the brightest when the hour is the darkest, and we live

888
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,640
in a dark time, but God said that we're to let our light shine, and oh, that God would

889
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:42,640
help us to shine as bright lights in this wicked and perverse generation.

890
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,140
For God, I'm reminded of what Paul was told by God with regard to Corinth, I have much

891
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,560
people in this city.

892
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,960
Listen, I believe that God's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come

893
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,480
to repentance.

894
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,060
He wants to save every single sinner.

895
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,900
He loves every single sinner, and He wants to use you and me to bring the gospel to them.

896
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,900
Let's pray together.

897
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,900
Father, we love You.

898
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,900
We thank You for loving us.

899
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,660
Thank You for Your Word.

900
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:13,260
We thank You this morning that You have given us the truth that we could know, that we could

901
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,100
be prepared and informed.

902
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:25,220
God, I pray that we would be moved this morning to do more, to proclaim the truth.

903
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:34,380
So many that have been deceived, Lord, I pray that You'd help us to stand with boldness

904
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:42,700
in every arena that You give us opportunity to be the light to a lost and dying world.

905
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:51,980
God, help us to have a heart for souls that have been blinded and deceived by the enemy.

906
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:58,340
Father, if there's one here that's never been saved, they do not know, they cannot answer

907
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,460
with certainty that heaven is their home.

908
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:07,460
Maybe they've trusted in some religion, some religious exercise.

909
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:14,380
God, help them to understand this morning that salvation is only through the shed blood

910
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,860
of Christ.

911
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:23,340
His death, His burial, and His glorious resurrection, that, Lord, today they'd be saved.

912
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:30,180
For those of us that are saved, Lord, would You help us to be motivated this morning to

913
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:36,620
proclaim the message loud and clear, to send the light, the blessed gospel light.

914
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,700
We pray that You'd move and work as only You can.

915
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,660
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

916
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,660
Would You stand with me?

917
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,540
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

918
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,180
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

919
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,500
As she does, the altar is open.

920
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,620
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

921
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,060
for sure that heaven is your home.

922
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,260
We never embarrass you, but we want you to know without any doubt that heaven is your

923
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,300
home.

924
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,180
If you're saved this morning, maybe God's impressed upon your heart to have a heart

925
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,140
for souls, to have that desire to let people know the truth.

926
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
