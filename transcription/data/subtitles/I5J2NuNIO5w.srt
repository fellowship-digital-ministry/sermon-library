1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
7 and we're looking at the entirety of this passage of scripture this morning Hebrews chapter number 7 looking at verses 1 through 28 and

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:11,039
You'll recall with us several chapters ago

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,479
Several lessons ago really through the book in chapter number 5. We were introduced to the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,860
It was in that chapter chapter number 5

5
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,579
That we saw the pattern of the Old Testament priesthood

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,719
We also saw the prophecy of a greater priesthood. Remember it was in Hebrews chapter number 5

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,020
Where we read that quote from Psalm 110

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,500
Psalm 110 verse number 4 that art thou art my son today

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,619
I've begotten thee excuse me verse number 6 of chapter 5

10
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:50,400
Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek and that's Psalm 110 in verse number 4 and we find that that Psalm had

11
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,080
Obviously regularly been accepted as being a messianic psalm prophecy and it was properly applied to the person of Jesus Christ

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,840
and we found that in chapter number 5 we read about the pattern of the Old Testament priesthood the

13
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,519
Prophecy of a greater priest and then as we went through chapter number 5

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,400
we find that the writer presents the Lord Jesus Christ as

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,160
The and proves that he is the fulfillment of that prophecy in Psalm 110 and that he indeed is

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,919
Superior and really what what was given to us in chapter number 5 as a preview

17
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,720
Now in chapter number 7 will be fully presented

18
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:38,440
Remember it was in chapter number 5 that he said this the writer says in verse number 10 called of God and high priest after

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,919
the order of Melchizedek and then in verse number 11 of whom we have many things to say and

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,519
We find that in chapter number 7 is where we begin to see those many things which he had to say

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,639
he took in a

22
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:56,160
Parenthesis if you will he said and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing and dealt with that

23
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,919
Warning section at the end of chapter number 5 all the way through chapter number 6 we end chapter number 6

24
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,440
Speaking again about the Lord Jesus Christ in verse number 20

25
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:11,080
Whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus and then notice

26
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:17,080
The way that the writer goes back to the subject that he was dealing with in chapter number 5 and will fully present it now

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,119
In chapter 7 made in high priest forever

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,360
After the order of Melchizedek and then he says for this Melchizedek chapter 7 verse number 1

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
King of Salem

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,360
priest of the Most High God

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,300
Who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all

32
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:43,179
First being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace

33
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:48,139
Without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life

34
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:52,479
But made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Continually skip down if you will and look at verse 24 and 25 with me

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,320
It says but this man speaking of Jesus because he continueth ever

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,479
half an

38
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,479
unchangeable priesthood

39
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,080
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him

40
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,960
Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. We'll look at the entirety of the chapter if you're taking notes

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,080
I have adopted the title from the end of verse number 24 an

42
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Unchangeable priesthood an

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,220
Unchangeable priesthood. It's interesting as we look at the text of Scripture

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,080
If you're taking notes notice number one the description of Melchizedek

45
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,960
Really in verses 1 through 10 of chapter number 7 the writer of Hebrews is giving us a description of Melchizedek

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,240
In fact, you'd have to travel all the way back to Genesis chapter number 14

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,880
And you would see just a couple of verses of Scripture in Genesis chapter number 14 about this one Melchizedek

48
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,160
There's a couple of verses in Genesis 14, there's one verse in Psalm 110

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,039
That's a prophecy concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. And that's all you read in the Old Testament about Melchizedek

50
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:05,440
In fact, if Hebrews did not give us the truth that is provided here in chapter 5 7 8 and in dealing with

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,000
The order of Melchizedek. The reality is that many of us probably would not even remember the name Melchizedek

52
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,600
It's just so quickly in chapter number 14 the book of Genesis and it

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,059
Amazes me when you think about the book that we hold in our hand you think about the divine author the

54
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,559
God of heaven that gave us this book and how he uses

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,959
the truth of Genesis 14 to prove to provide a type of the Lord Jesus Christ and we see here in Hebrews that

56
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,119
The writer takes these

57
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,279
These believers that he's writing to

58
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:45,320
Back to Genesis 14 now, we mentioned this as we studied the end of chapter number 6

59
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:53,359
these Jewish believers that are being written to in the book of Hebrews, they obviously held Abraham in high regard and

60
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,279
Abraham I mean he was the one that was given the promise father Abraham. I mean a dear

61
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,399
person

62
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:09,480
Patriarch within their culture within their understanding and we found that in chapter number 6 the writer begins to deal with some things with

63
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:17,279
regard to Abraham and then we get into chapter number 7 and God is going to use this brief interaction

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,760
between

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,839
Melchizedek and Abraham to show the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ. It's an amazing truth

66
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:33,559
It's a technical passage of Scripture and I'm gonna try to get through it and trust it to be a blessing to you this morning

67
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,839
We find that back in Genesis 14

68
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,880
In fact go back there if you will and I want you to see the verses that are given we have so much more

69
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,959
Information in the book of Hebrews about Melchizedek than we do in the book of Genesis

70
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:53,440
Because we find that in the book of Hebrews the truth that is given to us in Genesis this brief interaction is

71
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:58,679
Given to us in the fulfillment there in the book of Hebrews

72
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:05,119
In fact, it's interesting that as Abraham would return back. Remember he heard that Lot had been taken captive

73
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:10,059
He took all of the trained servants from his house and he went and he delivered Lot and the others

74
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,760
And we find that there were actually two kings that met him upon his return. One was the king of Melchizedek

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Melchizedek we see that the king of Salem

76
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:24,480
But we also see that the king of Sodom was there as well

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Not much dealt with with the king of Sodom

78
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:34,760
Because that's not a type of the the priesthood of Melchizedek the fulfillment of Jesus Christ in that typology

79
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,519
But notice here in verse number 18 of Genesis 14

80
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:46,160
The Bible says and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
the Most High God and

82
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:53,119
He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,399
possessor of heaven and earth and

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,000
blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and

85
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:08,119
He Abram or Abraham as we often refer to him as gave him Melchizedek tithes of all

86
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,040
It says and the king of Sodom said unto Abram

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,519
Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abram said to the king of Sodom

88
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,839
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord the Most High God the possessor of heaven and earth

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,559
That I will not take from from a thread even to a shoelatch it and that I will not take anything

90
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:33,760
That is thine lest thou should have say I have made Abram rich. It's interesting the king of Salem

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,559
Melchizedek this type of Jesus Christ that we see the fulfillment here in the book of Hebrews

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Abraham gives him tithes

93
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
The king of Sodom

94
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,559
Offers to pay Abraham some money and Abraham says no

95
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm not gonna take anything from you and it's interesting because look we there's very little given to us in Genesis about

96
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,799
Melchizedek, but look at how the writer of Hebrews

97
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:05,040
Expands this truth and gives us this typology again as we've mentioned with many characters throughout the Word of God

98
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,079
this Melchizedek just steps on the pages of Scripture and

99
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Just as quickly as he steps on he steps off. There's just a couple of verses

100
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,279
Remember as we've studied the life of Elijah, it's as if he just appears out of nowhere in first Kings 17

101
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,799
I mean BAM

102
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:24,959
there's Elijah standing before Ahab and you just see him and

103
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,559
You see his life and his ministry and all of those things in here with this Melchizedek

104
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:33,960
He just appears notice what the Bible tells us about the description of this one

105
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Melchizedek the Bible tells us look at the names that are given the titles if you will

106
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,479
verse number one king of Salem

107
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,239
verse number one priest of the Most High God

108
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,960
notice in verse number two king of righteousness

109
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,599
Then it says this and after that also king of Salem, which is

110
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
king of peace

111
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,960
The Bible gives us this information in verse number three now

112
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,320
It's interesting because as I mentioned as we looked at Genesis chapter number 14, there's no real record this this Melchizedek just appears

113
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,119
and

114
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,239
Here in verse number three, we find that there's no lineage that is provided for this one Melchizedek

115
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,320
The Bible says without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,640
But made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest

117
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,200
Continually as we look at verse number three and we notice that there's no lineage that's provided

118
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,400
It does not mean that he did not have mother or father

119
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:38,440
We just find that it's not provided for us in the account in the book of Genesis

120
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,359
It's very interesting that it's not provided for us in the book of Genesis because Genesis is a book of genealogies

121
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Genesis is a book where you see all of these things about the the family tribes and who begat who and so on and so

122
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
forth and you see these genealogies

123
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,239
throughout the book of Genesis and yet for this one

124
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
this Melchizedek

125
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
He's a king and a priest, which is, of course,

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
our Lord is prophet, priest, and king,

127
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,720
and we understand that, but we find that as a priest,

128
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,240
being able to provide your lineage

129
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
was of significant importance.

130
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
I won't ask you to turn back there,

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,960
but if you jot down in Nehemiah chapter number seven,

132
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,140
it's also recorded in the book of Ezra,

133
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,940
but in Nehemiah seven, verses 63 and 64,

134
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,240
the Bible says this, and of the priests,

135
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,100
the children of Habeiah, the children of Chaz,

136
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
the children of Barzillia,

137
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,540
which took one of the daughters of Barzillia,

138
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,180
the Gileadite, to wife, and was called after their name.

139
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,460
These sought their register among those

140
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,860
that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found.

141
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,140
What happened?

142
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,140
Therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.

143
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,660
They could not be called and counted

144
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,900
amongst the priests because they could not provide

145
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,500
their genealogy, their lineage.

146
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,980
And so we find here that it's very interesting

147
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,140
that there's no lineage that is provided.

148
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,420
The Bible tells us there in verse number three,

149
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,140
but made like unto the Son of God.

150
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,660
We see that this is an Old Testament type

151
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,540
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

152
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,300
We know that the Lord Jesus Christ, He is eternal, amen?

153
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,580
He has always been, He is, He was, and He will be,

154
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
and what a joy to understand that He is alpha and omega,

155
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,300
the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

156
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,380
There's never a time, I mean, because He transcends time,

157
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,820
you never can find a time when He did not exist

158
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,740
or that He will not exist.

159
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,100
Our God is eternal.

160
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,060
We find that it's interesting as we continue

161
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,980
to look at this description of Melchizedek

162
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,780
that the Bible tells us, and I mentioned it back in there

163
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,780
in Genesis 14, that Abraham gave tithes to Melchizedek.

164
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,860
Notice it says here in verse number four,

165
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,220
now consider how great this man was

166
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,340
unto whom, notice this phrase,

167
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,340
even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

168
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,660
Now think about this, for us this morning,

169
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,580
perhaps it's a little bit challenging,

170
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,220
but think about putting your mind

171
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,820
in the mindset of these Jewish believers,

172
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,740
the regard that they had for Abraham,

173
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,540
and then telling these believers,

174
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,060
now consider how great this man was,

175
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,900
speaking of Melchizedek,

176
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,740
unto whom even the patriarch Abraham

177
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,380
gave the tenth of the spoils.

178
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,780
See, they held Abraham at a high place,

179
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,020
and they're saying, but he, Abraham,

180
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,020
gave tithes to Melchizedek.

181
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,740
What does that show?

182
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,700
Well, certainly it shows who is the greater

183
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,620
in the minds of these Jewish believers

184
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,060
for them to begin thinking about this

185
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,340
which is being presented,

186
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,740
and to understand the application

187
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,580
by which this passage will lead to

188
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,340
in dealing with the superiority

189
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,340
of the priesthood of Jesus Christ,

190
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,300
we find that he's setting the scene

191
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,100
for them to understand,

192
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,500
you hold Abraham in high regard,

193
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,660
but he paid tithes to Melchizedek.

194
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,700
Notice, verse number five, as it continues,

195
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,140
it says, and verily, they that are of the sons of Levi,

196
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,980
now what is he doing?

197
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,100
He's dealing with the priesthood

198
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,940
that they would be familiar with, right?

199
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,340
We often refer to it as the Aaronic priesthood.

200
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,580
The Levitical priesthood will be the terminology

201
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,180
that will be used here in the book of Hebrews.

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,420
And look what he says, and verily,

203
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,380
they that are of the sons of Levi

204
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,740
who receive the office of the priesthood

205
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,700
have a commandment to take tithes of the people

206
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,540
according to the law.

207
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,340
That is, of their brethren,

208
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,260
though they come out of the loins of Abraham.

209
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,500
Now follow the thought, skip down if you will,

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,060
we'll look at verse six and seven in just a minute,

211
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,140
but look at verses eight through 10.

212
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,380
And here, men that die receive tithes,

213
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,860
but there he receiveth them

214
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,620
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

215
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,620
And as I may so say, Levi also who receiveth tithes,

216
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,820
notice this, paid tithes in Abraham.

217
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,660
How?

218
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,060
Well, he explains it in verse number 10.

219
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,180
For he, speaking of Levi,

220
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,860
was yet in the loins of his father

221
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,620
when Melchizedek met him.

222
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,700
Now, again, we often refer to Father Abraham, right?

223
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,860
And we understand the mindset of the Jewish believer

224
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,860
and how they would be wrapping their mind

225
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,020
around this truth that is presented,

226
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,820
and they're being given this obscure passage of scripture

227
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,340
in the book of Genesis,

228
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,500
many times we would just maybe rush right through it,

229
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,460
not even remember the details.

230
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,060
And the writer of Hebrews says,

231
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,180
and I wanna call your attention

232
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,940
to this interaction between Abraham and Melchizedek,

233
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
and we take the prophecy,

234
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,460
the messianic prophecy of Psalm 110,

235
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
and we're gonna properly apply it

236
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,540
to the person of Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

237
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,260
and we're going to prove this to you.

238
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,860
And he deals with the subject of these tithes that are paid.

239
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,700
See, the Bible tells us in verse number 10

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,460
that he, speaking of Levi,

241
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,300
was yet in the loins of his father.

242
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Levi is well after Abraham.

243
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,260
Abraham and Sarah didn't give birth to Levi, right?

244
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,340
Who was the promised son?

245
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,620
Isaac.

246
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,540
And then who?

247
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,860
Then Jacob.

248
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,700
Then who?

249
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,980
Then you get to Levi.

250
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,820
And by the way, then you eventually get to Amram,

251
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,620
who was the father of Aaron, right?

252
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,220
And you understand the Aaronic priesthood

253
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,860
as we often refer to it,

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,620
but you understand that as he, Abraham,

255
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,620
is the father of the nation, if you will,

256
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,140
we find that what the writer is saying

257
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,060
is that if Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek,

258
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,940
and Levi is through the loins of Abraham,

259
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,260
then in essence, Levi paid tithes to Melchizedek.

260
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,540
Now, think about the mind of these Jewish believers,

261
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,860
I mean, kind of scratching their head

262
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,460
and trying to wrap their mind around this truth

263
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,340
that is being presented to them.

264
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,780
Again, the temple is still standing,

265
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,700
the offerings are still being made,

266
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,980
the idea of some of these believers going back to Judaism,

267
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,020
and we find that the writer of Hebrews is saying,

268
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,260
no, continue to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.

269
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,420
He's better, he's superior, and I'm gonna prove it to you.

270
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,820
And he's been proving it chapter by chapter,

271
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,940
and he's been giving them the admonition to continue.

272
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Remember, as we dealt with the latter part

273
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,460
of chapter number six about the promises,

274
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,020
Abraham received a promise,

275
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,820
but he didn't obtain the promise

276
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,740
until he endured with patience.

277
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,820
We find that there's this challenge

278
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,580
that is given to continue.

279
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,820
We find that Melchizedek, not only did Abraham pay tithes

280
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,300
or give tithes to Melchizedek,

281
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,620
but we read in the book of Genesis,

282
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,380
in chapter 14 and verse number 19,

283
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,980
how Melchizedek blessed Abraham.

284
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,340
Notice it's recorded for us here in verses six and seven

285
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,860
of Hebrews chapter number seven.

286
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,700
But he whose descent is not counted from them

287
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,260
received tithes of Abraham.

288
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,100
What is he saying?

289
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,340
His lineage isn't through that line, right?

290
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
He's not of the Levitical priesthood.

291
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,980
He's not of the Aaronic priesthood.

292
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,460
This is a different priesthood altogether,

293
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,660
and he says that he received tithes of Abraham,

294
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,960
but then notice, and blessed him that had the promises.

295
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,260
God had given promises to Abraham,

296
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,500
and we find that Melchizedek blessed Abraham,

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,020
and it says in verse number seven,

298
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,140
without all contradiction,

299
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,180
the less is blessed of the better.

300
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,220
What is he saying?

301
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,900
Well, Melchizedek actually is greater than Abraham.

302
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Now that's kind of a mind-blowing thought

303
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,420
for the Jewish people.

304
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,180
And we find that as he's applying this truth,

305
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,060
he's dealing with the description here of Melchizedek,

306
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,180
and then, if you're taking notes, number two,

307
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,260
he's gonna deal with the insufficiency

308
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,180
of the Levitical priesthood.

309
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,980
So he presents the description of Melchizedek.

310
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,340
He presents this priesthood.

311
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,820
Remember, he's used the phraseology

312
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,740
beginning in chapter number five.

313
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,820
He gives, he referenced back again to this truth,

314
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,420
this prophecy of the order of Melchizedek,

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,260
the order of Melchizedek.

316
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,119
So he gives the description.

317
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,720
Now, he provides this truth,

318
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,400
the insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood.

319
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Now, we understand that the Old Testament

320
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,799
is full of typologies.

321
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,400
And as we would think about Old Testament types,

322
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,679
we understand that they represent something

323
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,080
that is far greater that will one day come.

324
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,640
Now, on this side of history,

325
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,679
we know that Jesus has already come.

326
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
And so we can look at the type

327
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
and we can see the fulfillment,

328
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,320
we can preach it from this perspective,

329
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,739
and no doubt that's exactly what's happening

330
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,000
as the writer of Hebrews is trying to present

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,760
these Jewish believers with the understanding

332
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,880
that Jesus is the fulfillment of this Old Testament type,

333
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,720
of this prophecy, this messianic psalm that we read,

334
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,480
that we know, that we've put in the category

335
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,080
of being messianic, Psalm 110, that's Jesus Christ.

336
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,360
He is the one after the order of Melchizedek.

337
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,799
And so he provides this insufficiency.

338
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
Notice in verse number 11, he says,

339
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,160
if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood,

340
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,080
for under it the people received the law.

341
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,000
Notice what he asks, what further need was there

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,559
that another priest should rise

343
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
after the order of Melchizedek

344
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,760
and not be called after the order of Aaron?

345
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,920
He's asking a question to provoke thought.

346
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Many times we do that.

347
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,360
We find as we read various...

348
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,660
whether it's the Bible or some other type of literature, as we have discussions

349
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,660
with individuals, there are times that we'll ask a question to provoke thought.

350
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,220
And here he's saying this, if therefore perfection were by the Levitical

351
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,240
priesthood, we know the Levitical priesthood, we're familiar with the

352
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,020
Levitical priesthood, the Aaronic priesthood as we've often referred to it

353
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,100
as, he says then if that brought perfection, why is there this Messianic

354
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,260
prophecy about the order of Melchizedek? What would be the need, what further need

355
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,260
was there for another priest that should rise after the order of Melchizedek?

356
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,500
Well the answer is obvious, if the Levitical priesthood, if the Aaronic

357
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,620
priesthood could bring perfection, there would be no need for another priesthood,

358
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:55,300
another order. But it couldn't bring perfection, it was a type. And therefore

359
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,900
this Messianic prophecy is given with regard to the order of Melchizedek, that

360
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,780
Jesus would be a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and we find

361
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,820
that he begins there in verse number 11 by dealing with the insufficiency of the

362
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,580
Levitical priesthood and proving that another priesthood, an order of

363
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,460
priesthood, was absolutely essential, and it was after the order of Melchizedek.

364
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,500
Notice, the priesthood required the law, we see in verse number 11, it says for

365
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,260
under it the people received the law, and notice something that the Bible gives us

366
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,180
here about the law in verse number 19, excuse me, the Bible tells us this,

367
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:44,980
for the law made nothing perfect, amen? It says, but the bringing in of a better

368
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,500
hope did, by the which we draw nigh unto God. So he deals with the fact that just

369
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,740
as the priesthood could not bring perfection, neither could the law. Hold

370
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,420
your place here and go back, if you will, to the book of Galatians, and then we're

371
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,860
gonna deal with the passage of the book of Romans, but I want you to look at

372
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,380
Galatians first, and notice what is being told to us here in Galatians chapter

373
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,100
number 3. Again, we'll be back to Hebrews 7 here in just a moment, but look here in

374
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,620
Galatians chapter number 3. Last week we took a lengthy period of time to look at

375
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,980
verses 6 down through verse number 18, and to deal with that promise that was

376
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,860
given to Abraham, the promise was of a seed. Remember, we mentioned that last

377
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,900
week, and the fulfillment of that, which is Christ, and how that we are the

378
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,900
heirs of promise, that we, in fact, would be called the children of Abraham, how? By

379
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,220
faith. What a blessing. But as the passage of Scripture continues, and it's so

380
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,260
interesting to see how Galatians 3, so similar to what we read at the end of

381
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,420
Hebrews 6 and into Hebrews chapter number 7, such great parallel passages of

382
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,300
Scripture, but in verse number 21 of Galatians 3, the Bible says,

383
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,180
is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a

384
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,460
law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by

385
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,980
the law. That makes sense. But he says this in verse 22, but the Scripture hath

386
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,940
concluded, all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might

387
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:29,140
be given to them that believe. Verse 23, but before faith came, we were kept under

388
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,500
the law, shut up unto the faith, which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore

389
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,060
the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified

390
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:50,100
by faith. The law could not do what Christ did. The law condemns. The law

391
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:57,060
doesn't give life. The law says, guilty! Amen? Thou shalt not, thou shalt not, thou

392
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:03,780
shalt not, right? I'm guilty. And James says if we offend in one, we're guilty of

393
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,340
all. And the reality here is when we think about this idea of a schoolmaster, many

394
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,820
people have the idea that this is a teacher. It really isn't a teacher. A

395
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,020
schoolmaster was one who was a guardian at this particular time in history. It

396
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,660
would be used this way, a guardian or a guide who would accompany privileged

397
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,900
boys to be instructed. Now here's the interesting thing. They themselves could

398
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,540
not give the instruction, but they would take them, those privileged boys, to the

399
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,340
one who could give the instruction. So therefore, we look at this usage of what

400
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,580
Paul says, the believers in Galatia here, the region of Galatia, wherefore the law

401
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,020
was our schoolmaster. The law cannot give life, but here's what it does. It leads to

402
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:58,420
the one who does, Jesus Christ. And as we look here in Galatians and couple that

403
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,580
with what we've seen there already in Hebrews 7, the insufficiency of the

404
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,380
Levitical priesthood, not only could the priesthood not bring perfection, but nor

405
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,140
could the law. Notice what Paul says in Romans. Turn over, if you will, to Romans

406
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,180
chapter number 10. In Romans chapter number 10, often we refer to, in this

407
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,340
passage, several verses near the middle and end of the passage, but I want to

408
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,020
draw your attention to the beginning of the tenth chapter of the book of Romans,

409
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,260
and look at what the Apostle Paul says here, and something that is so important

410
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,300
for these Jewish believers to understand, as the book of Hebrews is

411
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,140
showing the insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood. Notice in

412
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,500
verse number one of Romans 10. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for

413
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,420
Israel is that they might be saved. You see the heart of the Apostle Paul. He

414
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,380
says, for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to

415
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,460
knowledge. Look at verses 3 and 4. The Bible says this, for they, being ignorant

416
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,980
of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness,

417
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,380
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the

418
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:18,780
end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. And as we

419
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,500
understand, he says, listen, these, my brethren, he's speaking specifically

420
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,860
about these Jewish people. He says, my heart's desire for them and my prayer to

421
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,060
God for them is that they would be saved. But here's the problem. They're ignorant

422
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,740
of God's righteousness. There's been this blindness. He deals with that, and here

423
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,860
in the book of Romans, the blindness that has happened unto Israel. In fact, if

424
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,100
you were to read the book of John and you look at the great miracle when Jesus

425
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,500
healed that man that was born blind, and he stood before the religious leaders,

426
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,140
and they were questioning him, and they were just doubtful, and so on and so

427
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,900
forth, and he finally, after giving answer after answer, he says, I've told you

428
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,420
before. All I know is I was blind, and now I can see. If I tell you again, are you

429
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,060
gonna be his disciples also? Well, that didn't make him very happy. That just

430
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,500
angered them. And then we find that at the end of the passage, those religious

431
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,660
leaders come and say this, are we blind also? They weren't blind physically, but

432
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,540
they were blind spiritually. And as we think about this ignorance that Paul is

433
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,540
referring to here in Romans 10 and verse number 3, they're ignorant of God's

434
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,380
righteousness. They've been blinded. We find that they're going about to

435
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,940
establish their own righteousness. Listen, they have to submit to the truth of

436
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:42,140
God's Word that Christ came to fulfill, and that he is the end of the law, and we

437
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,140
find that through him comes grace and truth. Back to Hebrews chapter number 7,

438
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,360
we find here that he's dealing with the insufficiency. Notice, let's go back to

439
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,660
verse number 12 of Hebrews 7. For the priesthood being changed, there is made

440
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,900
of necessity a change also of the law. So he's saying, listen, the priesthood is

441
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,420
gonna change. It's not after the order of Levitical priesthood or Aaronic

442
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,420
priesthood, it's now gonna be after the order of Melchizedek. He speaks about

443
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,980
this change. Notice in verse number 13, for he of whom these things are spoken

444
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:18,620
pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar. Now

445
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,540
this is awesome, because here's what's happening. He's dealing with

446
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,740
the Lord Jesus Christ as being the fulfillment of this order of

447
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,820
Melchizedek, this greater priesthood, and he says, listen, the one by which we're

448
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,580
speaking of, he comes from another tribe. He doesn't even come from the tribe of Levi.

449
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,580
From our perspective, speaking to the Jews that are there, these Jewish

450
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,780
believers, he's not even qualified to be a priest. Why? Because he's not from the

451
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:54,460
right tribe, right? He's of a higher order. Notice verse number 14, for it is evident

452
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,460
that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing

453
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,860
concerning priesthood. See, if you were the tribe of Judah, you couldn't be a

454
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,020
priest. See, in the Old Testament, outside of Melchizedek, he's a king and a

455
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:18,060
priest, right? Outside of Melchizedek, you were either a king or you were a priest,

456
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:24,700
but you weren't both. You guys remember Uzziah? He is king, right? You

457
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,860
remember the famous passage of Scripture that we deal with with Uzziah in the year

458
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,140
that King Uzziah died, right? Isaiah saw the Lord high, holy, lifted up, so on and

459
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,500
so forth. Isaiah chapter number 6. Well, Uzziah, he was a king, and he served as a

460
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,140
king for a lengthy period of time. The Lord helped him, and man, God blessed, and

461
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,540
things were going well, but then he got a little prideful. And guess what happens?

462
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,300
Old Uzziah decides that he can go into the holy place and he can offer incense.

463
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,940
There were some priests that came in to try to get him out, to withstand him.

464
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,180
Thank God for those men.

465
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:07,220
See, Uzziah, you're the king, but you can't be a priest, because you're not of the right

466
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,700
tribe.

467
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
What happened to Uzziah?

468
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
He became a leper.

469
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,700
He became a leper.

470
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,380
See, Jesus Christ is of the tribe of Judah.

471
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,700
From their perspective, humanly speaking, he could not be a priest.

472
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,180
And so what is the writer doing?

473
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:29,180
He's proving he's from a higher order of priesthood, he's after the order of Melchizedek.

474
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,220
He's of the tribe of Judah.

475
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,060
We know that, but that does not disqualify him from being a priest, for he's after the

476
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,660
order of Melchizedek.

477
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,940
Notice verse number 15, and it is yet far more evident, for that after the similitude

478
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,260
of Melchizedek, notice, there ariseth another priest, who is made not after the law of a

479
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,180
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

480
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:01,820
Verse 17, for he testifieth, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

481
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,020
I'm so thankful for the book of Hebrews, because I'll be honest with you, if all we had were

482
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,140
the couple of verses in Genesis 14 and the Messianic Psalm of Psalm 110, we'd be scratching

483
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,060
our heads trying to figure out what this means.

484
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,860
But we find that here in Hebrews chapter number 17, it's like the peel is coming open and

485
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,820
we're seeing this revealed to us, and we're seeing the beauty of God's Word and the fulfillment

486
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,580
of this Messianic Psalm, this prophecy, and we find that it says in verse number 18, for

487
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:37,300
there is barely a disannulling of the commandment going before, for the weakness and unprofitableness

488
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
thereof.

489
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,500
For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which

490
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,620
we draw nigh unto God.

491
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,500
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest, for those priests which were

492
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,580
made without an oath.

493
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,460
But this, with an oath, by him that said unto him, the Lord swear and will not repent, thou

494
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,260
art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

495
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,740
How did you become a priest in the Old Testament?

496
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
Did you volunteer?

497
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,420
Say, hey, I want to be a priest.

498
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,660
No, you were born into the Levitical line, I mean, it was your lineage.

499
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,460
There was no situation, no oath, like we find it says that they were made without an oath,

500
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,580
they were born into it.

501
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,020
Remember that to Aaron, right, was given the tribe of Levi.

502
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,720
If you're with me through the study of the book of Joshua, we'll get to it in another

503
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,180
couple of lessons, but we've already made reference to it in some of our previous lessons,

504
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,800
the way in which the tribe of Levi, they didn't receive an inheritance.

505
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,560
And they did not have a possessed land, there were cities of the Levites that are detailed

506
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,120
for us in Joshua 21, but they did not receive a particular lot.

507
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,480
And we find here that they had been given to Aaron.

508
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,240
It says here, verse 22, by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

509
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
It leads us here.

510
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Let me mention one more thing about the insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood and then we'll

511
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
get into our final point.

512
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,200
Look at verse number 27.

513
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,560
The Bible says this, well, let me look at verse 23, sorry, two more things, I'm ready

514
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,960
to get to the last point.

515
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,020
It's exciting.

516
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,080
Verse 23, and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue

517
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,640
by reason of death.

518
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,760
You know why the Old Testament priesthood, the Levitical priesthood was insufficient?

519
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,000
Because they died.

520
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They died.

521
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,320
And then there was another one.

522
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,000
It says, and they truly were many priests, right, because they would die and then there'd

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,440
be another one and it was, that's how it worked, right?

524
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,800
Verse 27, notice another reason that the Old Testament priesthood, the Levitical priesthood

525
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,400
was not perfect, was insufficient.

526
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,360
It says, who need it not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice, notice this,

527
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,720
first for his own sins.

528
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,280
The high priest would go in on the Day of Atonement once a year to the Holy of Holies.

529
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,560
He had to go in first making an atonement for his own sin, then for the sin of the people.

530
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Jesus Christ is sinless.

531
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,520
So what was insufficient?

532
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,960
I've mentioned this many times that the, we finished up actually last Sunday morning

533
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,840
dealing with the fact that our forerunner, Jesus Christ, that he went, he passed through

534
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,640
the veil, that he's entered into heaven.

535
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,120
And what a joy, what a blessing to understand the truth.

536
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,880
If you go back to Hebrews chapter 4 and notice this declaration that is given in verse 14,

537
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,920
seeing then that we have a great high priest, notice this, that has passed into the heavens.

538
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,000
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

539
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,100
We find in the passage of Scripture here in Hebrews chapter number 7, number 1, the description

540
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,800
of Melchizedek, number 2, the insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood, and then finally

541
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,320
notice the superiority of Jesus Christ.

542
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,100
First we notice that he is eternal.

543
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:08,000
We find that the prophecy is mentioned, Psalm 110 in verse number 4, it's mentioned twice

544
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,120
in chapter number 5, it's given at the end of chapter number 6, it's mentioned twice

545
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,480
again here in chapter number 7.

546
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,720
And what is that prophecy of Psalm 110 in verse number 4?

547
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,840
We read it in verse 17 of chapter 7, and at the end of verse number 21, thou art a priest,

548
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,200
what does it say, forever after the order of Melchizedek.

549
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,480
We find that it said in verse number 16, the power of an endless life.

550
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,320
Notice with me in verse number 24, but this man, because he continueth ever.

551
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,360
It says this hath an unchangeable priesthood.

552
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,120
Tells us in verse number 25, wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost

553
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:00,440
that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

554
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,340
He ever liveth.

555
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,760
Verse 28, the last part of the verse says, who is consecrated forevermore.

556
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,440
You know, we serve a risen Savior.

557
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,240
I mean, we have to understand, yes, the beauty, the wonder of Calvary and the price that was

558
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,600
paid on the cross of Calvary for your sin and for my sin and for the sin of the world,

559
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,220
and we understand that he was buried in that borrowed tomb, but we serve a risen Savior.

560
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,480
We speak about it and we sing about it during the time in which we celebrate the resurrection

561
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,740
on Easter Sunday, if you will, and we mention many things about that, and we're very careful

562
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,840
to understand that every Sunday is the Lord's day.

563
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Why?

564
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,100
Because we serve a risen Savior.

565
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,280
The Apostle Paul made it abundantly clear in chapter number 15 of the book of 1 Corinthians

566
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,620
that if he did not raise from the dead, then our faith is vain, our preaching is vain.

567
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,700
I mean, it's just, it's hopeless, but we serve a risen Savior.

568
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,180
Notice what the Bible says in Revelation.

569
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,380
You don't need to turn there.

570
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,580
In chapter number one, in verse number 17, and when I saw him, I fell at his feet as

571
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,120
dead and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not.

572
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,180
I am the first and the last.

573
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:21,980
I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, amen, and have the

574
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,340
keys of hell and of death.

575
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,980
Man, we serve a risen Savior.

576
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,820
Every day of our lives, we must be mindful of the fact that he lives and he reigns and

577
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:38,560
he rules, and as we live this life, as we walk this journey, we're mindful of the fact

578
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,760
that we serve a risen Savior, that he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

579
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,640
We'll get to that in just a moment, but we understand his eternality.

580
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,200
Notice his character in the text of Scripture here.

581
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,720
We see his immutability mentioned as it speaks about he hath an unchangeable priesthood.

582
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,240
We mentioned a little bit about his immutability at the end of chapter number six in our last

583
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,660
week study, and we understand as we speak about the character, the attributes of God,

584
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,820
we often refer to his omnipotence and his omniscience and his omnipresence, and we should.

585
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,580
He's holy and he's just and he's righteous, and what a blessing to understand how God

586
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,460
has revealed himself to us in this precious book.

587
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,520
He's immutable.

588
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,700
He never changes.

589
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,600
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

590
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,060
We find that in just a little while, that the writer of Hebrews in chapter number 13

591
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,700
is going to declare that very truth to us.

592
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,420
In verse number eight of that passage, it says, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and

593
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,020
today and forever.

594
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,340
He said in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not.

595
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:51,860
But notice his character as it's given to us here in verse number 26, for such an high

596
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,380
priest became us.

597
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,460
Notice who is holy, who is holy.

598
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,980
Our God is holy.

599
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:05,380
I mentioned Isaiah 6, the year that Uzziah died.

600
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,260
Isaiah saw the Lord.

601
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,420
The Bible says that his train filled the temple.

602
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,420
The Bible says that they were crying out, those angels that were crying out, holy, holy,

603
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
holy.

604
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,540
Our God is holy.

605
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,340
You know, he made it abundantly clear to his people in the Old Testament, if you look and

606
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,060
study the book of Leviticus, he says to them over and over that he's holy.

607
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,940
In fact, when we find in the New Testament that Peter references that truth, that we're

608
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,540
to be obedient children, not fashioning ourselves according to our former conversation, that

609
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,180
we're to be holy as he is holy.

610
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,780
He says he's referencing back to the truth of the book of Leviticus.

611
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,120
If we were to give a brief description, in my opinion, of the books of Exodus and Leviticus,

612
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,000
we find that the book of Exodus is God bringing his people out of Egypt.

613
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Amen?

614
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He's bringing them out of Egypt.

615
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,200
Egypt is a picture of the world.

616
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,620
He's bringing him out of Egypt,

617
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,000
but then the book of Leviticus

618
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,560
is getting Egypt out of his people.

619
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,220
Giving him all the instruction.

620
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm a holy God.

621
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,120
Here's how you approach me.

622
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,960
Here's how you worship me.

623
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,360
By the way, He tells us

624
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,900
that we're to worship Him in spirit and in truth.

625
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,520
Amen? John 4.

626
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,320
The reality is that whatever we call worship

627
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,480
doesn't necessarily mean it's worship.

628
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,080
It's what God has prescribed as being worship.

629
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,960
But what a joy it is to worship Him.

630
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,440
He is worthy of our worship.

631
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,280
And we find that the Bible begins

632
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,800
in giving us this description of His character

633
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,800
that He is holy.

634
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,540
Oh, we better never get over the fact

635
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,440
that our God is holy.

636
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm thankful that our God is love and gracious.

637
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,880
We can go through all the attributes,

638
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,540
but we find His holiness.

639
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,640
And all of these other things really kind of emanate

640
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,320
out of the truth that He's holy.

641
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,640
He's in perfect character,

642
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,360
in perfect unity within all of these character traits,

643
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,960
but the reality is that our God is holy.

644
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,920
We must be mindful of that.

645
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,560
Notice it says harmless.

646
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Undefiled.

647
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,440
Separate from sinners.

648
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,680
I think that's interesting,

649
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,760
that phraseology separate from sinners,

650
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,640
because so often,

651
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,840
during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

652
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,240
He's accused of going in and eating with the sinners.

653
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,520
Right?

654
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,600
He came to seek and to save that which was lost.

655
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,120
And we find that as you look at the truth

656
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,320
of the character that is revealed to us,

657
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,680
that He's made, at the end of v. 26,

658
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,840
higher than the heavens.

659
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,600
See, as the author is presenting

660
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,040
the Lord Jesus Christ,

661
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,720
He's showing that He is superior.

662
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,760
He's better. He's greater.

663
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,440
He's dealt with the description of Melchizedek.

664
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,480
He's dealt with the insufficiency

665
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,200
of the Levitical order,

666
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
the Aaronic order,

667
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,360
the priesthood order that they would be familiar with.

668
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,240
And He's now presenting the Lord Jesus Christ

669
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
as the fulfillment.

670
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,880
We find that He's sinless.

671
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,200
Notice in v. 27,

672
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,760
who needeth not daily as those high priests

673
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,080
to offer up sacrifice,

674
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,520
notice first for His own sins,

675
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,560
and then for the people's.

676
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,880
For this He did once when He offered up Himself.

677
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,120
See, there was no need for Him to offer up

678
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,160
any offering for His own sins,

679
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,760
for He was sinless.

680
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,520
2 Corinthians 5.21,

681
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,080
for He, speaking of God the Father,

682
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,120
hath made Him, speaking of Jesus Christ,

683
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,800
to be sin for us,

684
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
who knew no sin,

685
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,240
that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

686
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,920
Peter declares it this way

687
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,560
in 1 Peter 3 and v. 18.

688
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,440
What a great truth.

689
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,000
It says,

690
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
for Christ also hath once suffered for sins,

691
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,200
the just for the unjust,

692
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,280
that He might bring us to God,

693
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,880
being put to death in the flesh,

694
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,800
but quickened by the Spirit.

695
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,640
See, He did this once.

696
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,280
It leads right into,

697
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
as we think about the superiority of Christ,

698
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,960
it leads into the substitutionary atonement.

699
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,760
What He did for us.

700
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,640
These priests,

701
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
this Old Testament order,

702
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,800
man, they were regularly making these offerings.

703
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,480
I mean, every day.

704
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,720
In fact, as we will soon get into the 10th chapter

705
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,080
of the book of Hebrews,

706
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,720
we find that He talks about the way in which

707
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,200
they are continually making these offerings

708
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,400
and day by day by day.

709
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,480
But this man,

710
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,280
because it's a substitutionary atonement,

711
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,680
because he's sinless,

712
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,720
because he's God in flesh,

713
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,400
after he'd made one sin for sacrifice forever,

714
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,840
excuse me, one sacrifice for sin forever,

715
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,960
he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

716
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,440
And what a blessing to understand

717
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,320
that he only made one sacrifice,

718
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,840
one offering.

719
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,760
And what did he offer?

720
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,000
He offered himself.

721
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,040
He offered himself.

722
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
We notice at the end of verse number 27,

723
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,200
it says,

724
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,080
for this He did once

725
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,080
when He offered up Himself.

726
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,680
It's interesting if we could go

727
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,360
just a few verses into the eighth chapter.

728
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,320
We'll deal with this in more detail next week.

729
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,640
But notice in verse number three

730
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,040
of chapter eight of the book of Hebrews,

731
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,960
it says, for every high priest

732
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,600
who is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices.

733
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,440
We know that.

734
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,920
If you read the Old Testament,

735
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,320
you read all of the sacrificial system

736
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,520
and all those things,

737
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,240
you understand that they were ordained

738
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,840
to offer gifts and sacrifices.

739
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,040
Notice it says this at the end of verse number three,

740
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,280
wherefore, it is of necessity

741
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,240
that this man have someone also to offer.

742
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,400
What was his offering?

743
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,240
Himself.

744
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,600
And it was for sin forever.

745
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,240
Now as we begin to think about the truth

746
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,800
that he made this sacrifice

747
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,600
as we refer to it as the substitutionary atonement.

748
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,960
Yes, what did it accomplish?

749
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,160
Salvation, reconciliation.

750
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,560
We see in verse number 25,

751
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,880
it says, wherefore, he is able also

752
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,840
to save them to the uttermost

753
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,080
that come unto God by him.

754
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,240
Isn't that a contrast to what we read

755
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
in verse number 11?

756
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,960
A great contrast when it says,

757
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,000
if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood.

758
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,600
No, it's not.

759
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,800
It can't be.

760
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,560
Verse 19, the law made nothing perfect.

761
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,040
But we find that here,

762
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,600
speaking of the superiority of Jesus Christ,

763
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,240
he says that what his offering,

764
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,840
what his sacrifice accomplished

765
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
was that he is able to save them

766
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,640
to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

767
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,360
Reconciliation.

768
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,320
The Bible says that he's our intercessor.

769
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,920
Notice it says that he ever liveth

770
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,440
to make intercession for us.

771
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,920
An intercessor is a mediator,

772
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,840
one who really interposes between two parties

773
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,200
that are at variance one with another.

774
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,400
What's the purpose?

775
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
To bring reconciliation.

776
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
That's the purpose.

777
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,000
And we see that's exactly what Jesus Christ did.

778
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,520
You know what those Old Testament sacrifices

779
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,720
reminded the people of every day?

780
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,600
That what they offered yesterday was not sufficient

781
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,720
because they had to come back today.

782
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,200
They had to bring another offering.

783
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,480
They had to bring another offering.

784
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,800
They had to bring another offering.

785
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,960
They had to bring another offering.

786
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,800
Why?

787
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,640
Because it's insufficient.

788
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,240
The blood of bulls and goats can never,

789
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,000
the Bible tells us,

790
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
it can never take away sins.

791
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,680
But the power of Christ's blood.

792
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,160
We sing there's power in the blood.

793
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,160
We understand the truth when Peter says

794
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,000
that we're not redeemed with corruptible things

795
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,320
received from our vain conversation

796
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,440
or received by tradition from our fathers.

797
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,280
How are we saved?

798
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,800
We're not with the gold and silver

799
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,760
and all of those things.

800
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,680
No, we're saved with the precious blood of Christ.

801
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,560
What a blessing.

802
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,440
We find that here in the book of Hebrews

803
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,880
in chapter number 7,

804
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,720
as he began dealing with this subject

805
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,720
in chapter number 5 and he previews it,

806
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,920
I want you to understand there's a pattern

807
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,800
for the Old Testament priesthood

808
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,360
and you're familiar with it.

809
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,120
Jewish people he's speaking to.

810
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,160
Very familiar with the Old Testament priesthood.

811
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
He says, I want you to understand though

812
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,000
that there's a prophecy

813
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,360
that deals with a greater,

814
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,600
a higher order of priesthood.

815
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,240
The order of Melchizedek.

816
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,400
I have a whole lot of things to say,

817
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,480
but you're not ready for it yet.

818
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,000
You're dull of hearing.

819
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,880
And he gives them this warning

820
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,320
and then he gets right back to it.

821
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,600
And here's all the things that he wants to say.

822
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,640
And oh, how he unwraps it and presents it.

823
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,240
What was given in chapter number 5

824
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,200
as a preview is now fully presented

825
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,440
in chapter number 7.

826
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,960
And he says, listen,

827
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,960
here's the description of Melchizedek.

828
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,440
Here's the insufficiency of that

829
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,760
which we're familiar with,

830
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,400
the Aaronic priesthood,

831
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,800
the Levitical priesthood.

832
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,360
We understand these things,

833
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,040
but it's insufficient.

834
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,480
And let me show you the superiority

835
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,640
of Jesus Christ and his priesthood.

836
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,920
He is the fulfillment.

837
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,920
He is that Messiah that was spoken of in Psalm 110

838
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,960
that he would come and he would be a priest forever

839
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,640
after the order of Melchizedek.

840
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,560
See, we serve a great God.

841
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,920
We really do.

842
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,360
And we understand what he's,

843
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,440
how he's working,

844
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,560
how he's interceding on our behalf,

845
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,080
the salvation that he offers,

846
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,520
the work that was accomplished

847
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,960
at the cross of Calvary

848
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,400
and how he ever liveth to make intercession.

849
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,760
They could look at some of these patriarchs.

850
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,920
They could look at some of the priests

851
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,480
and they could see that they died.

852
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,600
And then there was another one

853
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
and so on and so forth.

854
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,560
But our great high priest,

855
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,080
he ever liveth.

856
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,760
The writer of Hebrews is saying to these Jewish believers

857
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,400
who are contemplating,

858
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,600
because of all that they're dealing with,

859
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,280
the thought of returning to Judaism.

860
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,840
He says, why would you ever do it?

861
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,080
Don't do it.

862
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Let me show you that we have a higher priest,

863
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,040
a greater priest.

864
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,600
See, you see the temple over there.

865
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,440
And of course, we can read during the time

866
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,840
in which the Lord Jesus Christ, Caiaphas, right?

867
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,440
And you can read of those things that are going on

868
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,120
and how the religious leaders,

869
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,080
not only the priest and Caiaphas being there,

870
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,040
you can read about the Pharisees

871
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,840
and the Sadducees and all of those people.

872
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
What are they crying out?

873
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,600
Crucify Him.

874
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,520
Right? Now, these Jewish believers,

875
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,960
they see the temple.

876
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,760
They see that there's a priest over there.

877
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,520
They're making sacrifices.

878
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,640
He's saying don't go back

879
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,400
because we have a great high priest.

880
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,760
He's our great high priest.

881
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,600
He's after.

882
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,240
the order of Melchizedek and what a great presentation in Hebrews chapter

883
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,440
number seven so we need to be mindful this morning just as these Jewish

884
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,400
believers of what we have in Christ what we have in Christ we need to live each

885
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,020
day understanding that he lives understanding that I have a great high

886
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,960
priest that that liveth and he makes intercession for me and and we

887
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:36,960
understand what he accomplished and perhaps as we begin to live with the

888
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,520
knowledge that he lives will have a great impact on the society in which we

889
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,200
live see because we live in a society who is I mean the the we see him all

890
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,640
around us we've known it for a long time but oh how the makeup is coming off so

891
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:04,720
to speak amen I mean it's it's bad sin is bad it's wicked it's evil and the

892
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:12,520
answer is Jesus and as we understand who we are in Christ and who he is to us it

893
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,720
enables us to live a life before the world that can make an impact see Jesus

894
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:28,240
said you're the salt of the earth he said you are the light of the world if

895
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:37,240
the salt hath lost its savor it's good for nothing we find that we are to live

896
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,220
in this sin-cursed world we're to live in this world of people that we

897
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,400
understand as Paul says in the book of Philippians that there are many that are

898
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,480
the enemies of the cross of Christ but we're to live as salt and as light and

899
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,480
say let me tell you about my Savior let me tell you how great my God is let me

900
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,760
through the way that I live my life let it show how great our God is I preached

901
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,800
a message a few weeks ago on a Wednesday evening from the book of Nehemiah and

902
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,720
excuse me from the book of Ezra and as we look at that passage of Scripture and

903
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,000
we deal with the subject matter as to what we were dealing with we find that

904
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,840
there Ezra understood that the hand of his God was upon him some of you were

905
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,840
here on that Wednesday night some of you were tuning in via livestream but let me

906
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,600
just summarize quickly what I dealt with on that night and hopefully make

907
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,120
application through what we're dealing with even here in Hebrews 7 because we

908
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:49,680
serve a God who lives and and see here's what Ezra was dealing with and we look

909
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,520
at the passage of Scripture and we understand he had gone and he had

910
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:02,080
declared how great his God was he had talked to the king I have a great God

911
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,760
here's what my God's able to do he'll bless those that are for him he'll curse

912
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,720
those that are against him I mean we have a great God and then he had to take

913
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,160
a journey to Jerusalem and that journey that he'd have to take to Jerusalem was

914
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:24,220
a dangerous journey there were enemies in the way so here's the thought I can

915
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,840
go to the king and request what I've called a military escort but you know

916
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:36,480
what you know he said I was ashamed I was ashamed to ask for this military

917
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,760
escort why because I'd already told him how great my God is and now I'm gonna go

918
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,280
and say to the king actually we got this dangerous journey that we're gonna go on

919
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,600
and I know I told you all this stuff about my God and what he's able to do

920
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,280
but I really need your soldiers to accompany me so that we can make it

921
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,080
safely Ezra says I was ashamed I couldn't do it so you know what Ezra did

922
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:05,360
fasted and prayed so he did and he besought the Lord God I know that

923
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:13,240
you're able I the prayers not recorded for us I'm just using my imagination my

924
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,400
imagination as to what he would have prayed think about Psalms I will lift up

925
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,400
mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the

926
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:32,360
Lord which made heaven and earth God if you spoke all of this into existence and

927
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:39,760
I know you did I believe your record then God this journey is nothing for you

928
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,680
it's easy for you to protect me and if you read the passage of Scripture you

929
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,200
read in verse number 32 of that passage that the Bible says and we came to

930
00:54:52,200 --> 00:55:00,120
Jerusalem see in Hebrews chapter number seven these Jewish believers were

931
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,560
struggling the thought of returning to Judaism it just seemed to them it would

932
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,860
make things so much easier and the writer of Hebrew says no we have a

933
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:21,960
greater high priest God in flesh the Lord Jesus Christ he is our God he is

934
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,480
our priest he's prophet priest and King and he's after the order of Melchizedek

935
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,000
and let me show you what he accomplished for us that this Levitical priesthood

936
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,760
could never accomplish so why would you want to go back remember what it was

937
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:46,240
that Peter said disciples left Jesus looks to the twelve returns to them and

938
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:54,400
he says will you go away also Peter says to whom shall we go we know that now

939
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,920
art the Christ and that thou hast the words of eternal life see we serve a

940
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:08,080
great God and we take the truth of God's Word and apply in our lives and let a

941
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:15,520
world see how great our God is we're speaking recently as a family I think

942
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,080
was Holly actually that made the statement speaking about how great our

943
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,040
God is and some of what she has been reading in her personal devotions she

944
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,880
said it's a shame that the world doesn't know how great our God is you know whose

945
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:40,360
job it is it's our job it's our job to declare his greatness the Lord is great

946
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:46,680
Psalm 48 great is the Lord and greatly to be praised amen the psalmist says I

947
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:54,120
know that my God is great I know he is but then he says this I'm gonna declare

948
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,440
his greatness why because there's a generation that needs to know just how

949
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,720
great our God is we have a great high priest his name is Jesus and he's our

950
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:12,360
Savior if you've trusted him you understand what he is to you we have a

951
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,040
responsibility to take that message to a lost and dying world an unchangeable

952
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:24,120
priesthood the writer presents what had been previewed fully the superiority of

953
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,800
Jesus Christ let us pray father we love you we thank you for loving us we thank

954
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,200
you so much for your word the truth contained therein thank you for this

955
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,720
passage of Scripture in which it so adequately presents the Lord Jesus

956
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,000
Christ is our great high priest not after the Levitical priesthood or the

957
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,280
Aaronic priesthood but after the order of Melchizedek and God help us to

958
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,840
rejoice in who you are your character but also to rejoice in what you've done

959
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,840
for us the fact that you live and that you ever live to make intercession for

960
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:09,480
us father if there's one that's present one that's tuned in via livestream

961
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,600
that's not yet trusted the Lord Jesus Christ of their personal Savior it's

962
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,040
our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation but they would

963
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:23,400
understand that Jesus is the way the truth in the life no man cometh unto the

964
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:30,840
father but by him not by works of righteousness which we have done but

965
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:37,440
according to his mercy hath begotten us Lord help us those of us that are saved

966
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,680
to go and live our lives as the salt of the earth in the light of the world

967
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:51,120
showing the greatness of our God help us Lord I pray in Christ's name would you

968
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,000
stand with me heads
