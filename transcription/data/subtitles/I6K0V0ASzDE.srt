1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,239
We're ready this evening to turn to a number of passages, and this is going to be a springboard

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:11,079
passage that we're going to start in here and look at a number of verses of Scripture

3
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,380
this evening.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,319
As we really are going to enter into, this will be kind of an introductory lesson or

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:22,600
message on a series that we'll do on Wednesday evenings here for the next, I don't know,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,479
six to ten weeks, something like that, and as the Lord would lead.

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:31,479
But the title for the message this evening, and really the title for the whole series

8
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:36,360
will be this, The Danger of Deception.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,400
The Danger of Deception.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,880
I believe this evening, well let's look at Mark 13, look at verses 5 and 6.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,639
The Bible says here in Mark 13,

12
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:55,200
And Jesus, answering them, began to say, Take heed, lest any man deceive you.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,040
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,680
What a warning that is issued here in Mark chapter number 13.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,199
You can read it in Matthew 24 as well, but you find that the Lord Jesus Christ in verse

16
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:16,080
number 5 says, Take heed, lest any man deceive you.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,160
The word deceive means to cause, to stray.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:27,319
It carries with it the idea of to lead astray or to lead aside from the right way.

19
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:34,319
It's also understood that this word deceive carries with it the idea of to lead away from

20
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,319
truth or to lead into error.

21
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,199
I believe that we are living in an age of deception.

22
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:53,199
As you just look around, I mean, you don't have to look far, I believe that in 2021,

23
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,800
we are living in an age of deception.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,339
And as we acknowledge that there is a famine of truth in our land, and we at the same time

25
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:09,160
acknowledge that there's an onslaught of deception, we must take heed, as the Savior says in verse

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,320
number 5.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,600
To take heed means to see, to discern.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,800
It carries with it the idea of being on guard, to beware.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,160
We find that throughout the Scriptures that God has given us the warnings that we need.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,960
In fact, there are many times in which you read in the Word of God, beware, take heed.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,639
God wants us to be aware of what's taking place.

32
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,639
He wants us to be aware of how our enemy operates and what he does.

33
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,600
And we understand that our enemy is a liar, amen?

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,520
He is the father of lies.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,600
In fact, the very original work of Satan in the garden was that of deception.

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,240
We will not take the time to look back at Genesis chapter number 3, but I do want to

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,919
remind you what Paul says to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter number 2.

38
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,759
Turn over there if you will, and we're aware that the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter

39
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,880
number 3 that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field.

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,919
And we understand that as Satan came in there to the garden, that he says to Eve,

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,199
yea, hath God said.

42
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,160
And then he continues on and he says, ye shall not surely die.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,960
And we find that as Paul would reference this account in Genesis chapter number 3, as he's

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,559
speaking to Timothy and really dealing in verse number 14 with this very event, notice

45
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:36,440
what he says, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,479
When you think about that phraseology in verse number 14 with dealing with the subject

47
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,360
of deception and understanding that we're living in an age of deception, deception is

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,880
nothing new.

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,520
The enemy has sought to deceive from the very beginning.

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,759
Again, he's the father of lies.

51
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,279
There are some that would seek to distinguish between lying and deception.

52
00:03:56,279 --> 00:04:05,720
The reality is that deception is lying, and there's a very discreet manner and some of

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,240
the words that are used with regard to that idea of deceit and the enticing words that

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,199
would be used and so on and so forth.

55
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,959
One of the greatest illustrations that I think of in the Word of God with regard to deceit

56
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,320
is that of the brothers of Joseph when they dipped the coat of many colors in blood and

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,519
they know exactly what's taking place and they know all that has transpired, for they're

58
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:35,559
the ones that did it, and they come back to Dad and they say, do you know whose this is?

59
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,399
What does Jacob say?

60
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,399
He says, it's Joseph.

61
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,480
Surely he's been devoured by a wild beast, and they allowed him to believe that, right?

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,880
They deceived him through that action.

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,880
This evening, if you're taking notes, I want you to note first of all the reality of deception.

64
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,440
The reality of deception.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,920
Start with me in the book of Romans in the 16th chapter, and I want you to see again

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,679
this reality and this age of deception that we're living in.

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,239
In Romans chapter number 16, the Bible says this in verse number 17,

68
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:13,720
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,040
doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Notice in verse 18, for they that are such, so those that are described in verse number

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,200
17, those that cause divisions and offenses that are contrary to the doctrine which ye

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,760
have learned, they're peddling some other teaching, some other doctrine.

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,160
He says, for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly,

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,540
and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

75
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,279
You notice that it speaks at the end of verse number 18 that they deceive the hearts of

76
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,000
the simple, but I want you to notice by what means it is that they deceive the hearts of

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the simple.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
By good words and fair speeches.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,880
How many people today hear someone stand up that has oratory ability, and they stand up

80
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,579
and they're able to give some type of a presentation, they're able to speak, and they speak authoritatively,

81
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:23,399
and they speak on a subject, and they are able with their fair speech deceive the masses.

82
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,640
Notice in Ephesians chapter number 4.

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Not only do we note here in Romans chapter number 16 that it's by their good words and

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,140
fair speeches, but it's interesting as to what we see that Paul says here in Ephesians

85
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,119
chapter number 4 with regard to these deceivers.

86
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,799
In verse number 14, the Bible says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and

87
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:51,160
fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness.

88
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,399
Notice this, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

89
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,559
You know, there are people that are literally waiting to pounce on the opportunity to deceive.

90
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,720
They lie in wait to deceive.

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,519
Again, we live in the age of deception, and we find that it's interesting within the context

92
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,260
of Ephesians chapter number 4, and we'll mention this near the end of the message, but you

93
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,820
find that in verse number 11 it says he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists

94
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
and some pastors and teachers.

95
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,320
Why did God give?

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,500
Why did He call these individuals?

97
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,820
Why did He gift these individuals?

98
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,619
Why did He give them to the church for, in verse number 12, the perfecting of the saints,

99
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:38,739
for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.

100
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:43,019
Notice till we all come in the unity of the faith, under the knowledge of the Son of God,

101
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,859
to a perfect man, under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

102
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:51,739
One of the responsibilities of the pastor, and you see that that office is given, it's

103
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:56,700
referenced in verse number 11, is to feed the flock of God.

104
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,420
One of the terminologies that is used to describe the office of a pastor is that he's the undershepherd,

105
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,019
and it's interesting if you were to do a study in the book of Ezekiel and you would notice

106
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,459
the reference to the shepherds as God would give an indictment on the shepherds and how

107
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,859
they were more concerned with themselves than with the flock that they were called to minister

108
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:19,859
to.

109
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:25,339
And we think about the responsibility to feed the flock of God, to be a good shepherd, and

110
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:30,820
not to replace the good shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ, and not to try to take that

111
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,739
title away, but to fulfill the ministry and to feed the flock of God, to proclaim, to

112
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,299
propagate the truth, to preach the word.

113
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,299
Why?

114
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,460
So we understand there are those that lie in wait to deceive.

115
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,119
Notice in Ephesians chapter number 5.

116
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,859
Notice what he says here in verse number 6.

117
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:52,859
This is interesting.

118
00:08:52,859 --> 00:09:01,780
It says this, let no man deceive you with vain words.

119
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:09,260
Now the idea of vain words are words that are empty or words that are void of truth.

120
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,780
But he says this, let no man deceive you.

121
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:20,539
So I'm puzzled as I begin to look at this admonition, this charge, if you will, from

122
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,979
Paul to the believers in Ephesus under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, when

123
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:30,940
he says, listen, there are people that lie in wait to deceive you, but let no man deceive

124
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
you.

125
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,340
So we know, we understand that there are those that lie in wait to deceive that are anxiously

126
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,539
awaiting the opportunity to pounce upon the opportunity to deceive you.

127
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,260
That's what he says to the believers in the church at Ephesus.

128
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,020
And then he says this, but let no man deceive you.

129
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,539
Similar to what Jesus said when he said, take heed, lest any man deceive you.

130
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,140
And you think about that taking heed, you think about here where he says, let no man

131
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Let no man deceive you that we're on guard,

132
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,280
that we're taking caution,

133
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,580
that we are discerning and aware

134
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,620
of what's going on,

135
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,780
that we can filter everything through

136
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,440
what this book says.

137
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,520
He says let no man deceive you

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,900
with vain words, with empty words,

139
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,440
with words that are void of truth.

140
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,180
It doesn't matter that they may

141
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,700
have good oratory ability.

142
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,220
We must understand that often

143
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,900
those that are seeking to deceive

144
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,940
will use those vain, those words

145
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,460
that are void of truth.

146
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,340
Notice in Colossians 2,

147
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,140
we're preaching through the book of Colossians

148
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,500
on Sunday mornings.

149
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,420
Our theme throughout this year

150
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,600
has been found in verse number 10,

151
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,220
that we are complete in Christ

152
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,820
and what a blessed truth and thought that is.

153
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
But we find, and I preached this passage

154
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,620
of scripture many months ago,

155
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,660
but notice what Paul says to these believers

156
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,580
in Colossians 2 in verse number four.

157
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,020
In this I say, lest any man should beguile you

158
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,620
with enticing words.

159
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,740
Now, the word deceive is not here,

160
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,860
but the word beguile literally means

161
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,340
to deceive by false reasoning.

162
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,180
So he says, let no man deceive you

163
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,780
in Ephesians 5 and 6.

164
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,220
And here we find that it says,

165
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,980
in this I say, lest any man should beguile you

166
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,540
with enticing words.

167
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
A few verses later in verse number eight,

168
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,500
he'll say, beware, lest any man spoil you

169
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,420
through philosophy and vain deceit

170
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,780
after the tradition of men,

171
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,380
after the rudiments of the world,

172
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,100
and not after Christ.

173
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,820
How is it that they beguile,

174
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,860
the Bible tells us in verse number four,

175
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,580
with enticing words.

176
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,620
These enticing words are words or speech

177
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,880
that is adapted to persuade.

178
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,700
It's purposeful.

179
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
Specious discord leading others into error.

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,340
That's the idea of enticing words.

181
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
You understand when someone's trying to deceive you,

182
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,660
when someone's lying to you,

183
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,820
they don't announce that they're seeking to deceive you.

184
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Amen?

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,540
They use enticing words.

186
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,300
They use fair speeches.

187
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,340
They use vain words.

188
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,060
Notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number two,

189
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,900
we see this again.

190
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,300
This is a recurring statement that we see

191
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,620
throughout the Word of God

192
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,860
with regard to this subject of deception.

193
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,780
And here in 2 Thessalonians two and verse number three,

194
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,260
again it says, let no man deceive you.

195
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,220
But I want you to notice that in Ephesians,

196
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,100
it says with vain words.

197
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,860
In Colossians, it says with enticing words.

198
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,100
But here we find in 2 Thessalonians,

199
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,300
he says, by any means.

200
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I mean, he's making the truth to these believers

201
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,180
and for us this evening to understand

202
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,660
that we're to let no man deceive you

203
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,940
by any means for that day shall not come

204
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,220
except there come a falling away first

205
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,420
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.

206
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,940
Very quickly in the book of 2 Thessalonians,

207
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,180
Paul had been used by God to minister

208
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
in the city of Thessalonica.

209
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
He was only there for a short period of time.

210
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,780
And he wrote 1 Thessalonians

211
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,660
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

212
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,500
to the believers at Thessalonica.

213
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,860
And then there was some group or individual,

214
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,220
we don't know for sure,

215
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,540
but someone sent a letter to the church in Thessalonica

216
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,620
claiming to be from the apostle Paul

217
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,580
that was giving them wrong information.

218
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,700
And Paul deals with that.

219
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,020
And he says, let no man deceive you by any means.

220
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,980
Listen, they're crafty.

221
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,380
Remember the enemy, he's more subtle

222
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,460
than any beast of the field in Genesis chapter number three.

223
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,380
And so we find that here, listen,

224
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,480
the reality is that there is deception

225
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,860
that takes place in our land that times, at times,

226
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,940
comes from those that even would claim

227
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,740
to have some measure of Christianity

228
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,820
and be perhaps in the large umbrella of Christendom.

229
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,220
And I understand that that's a large umbrella.

230
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,500
And there are many that would claim the term

231
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,780
or the word Christian and Christianity

232
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,180
that have never been born again.

233
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,220
And we understand the difference,

234
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,060
but we find here that that deception

235
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,100
comes from a variety of areas.

236
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,420
And here for the church in Thessalonica,

237
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,500
there was a counterfeit letter that was written

238
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,420
that was claimed to be written by Paul.

239
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,140
And he says, let no man deceive you by any means.

240
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,700
Notice in 2 Timothy chapter number three.

241
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,100
In 2 Timothy chapter number three,

242
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,340
the text of Scripture begins by saying,

243
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,740
this know also.

244
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Again, I had made this statement on Sunday,

245
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,980
how thankful I am that God desires

246
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,540
for His children to be informed,

247
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,140
that we would not be ignorant,

248
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,540
that we would have knowledge with regard

249
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,180
to those things that we would deal with.

250
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,420
And he says, this know also that in the last days,

251
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,340
perilous times shall come.

252
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,620
We do not have time this evening

253
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,340
to look at all of the description

254
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,460
that is given to us with regard to the last days,

255
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,700
but I would like you to draw your attention

256
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,340
to verse number 13, where the Bible says this,

257
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,020
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse.

258
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Notice what it says, deceiving and being deceived.

259
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,140
So there are these evil men and these seducers

260
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,820
that are waxing worse and worse,

261
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,940
and they're engaged in deceiving,

262
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,900
but they themselves are also being deceived.

263
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,700
Deceiving and being deceived.

264
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,280
Again, the age of deception.

265
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,020
Notice in the book of Titus in chapter number one,

266
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,020
as we look at this particular book of Titus,

267
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,300
we find that here, God is calling and directing

268
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,700
that Titus would go and serve in Crete,

269
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
and Titus is referred to as just a great relationship

270
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,540
that he had with Paul, his son of the faith,

271
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,120
and mentions the same type of verbiage

272
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,180
that is referenced there to Timothy.

273
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,700
We find that he was there in Crete,

274
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,900
and he had a responsibility in Crete,

275
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,340
and it was to set an order,

276
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,460
according to verse number five,

277
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,060
for this cause left I thee in Crete,

278
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,500
that thou should have set in order

279
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,620
the things that are wanting,

280
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,940
and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed thee.

281
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,260
And so we find that Titus has this call of God

282
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,700
upon his life, he's there for a purpose,

283
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,380
and we find that purpose in verse number five,

284
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
but you find that in verse number 10,

285
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,220
notice what the scriptures tell us,

286
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,220
for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,

287
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,540
especially they of the circumcision,

288
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,180
referring to the Jews.

289
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,420
And we find here that there were many

290
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,820
that were in this place Crete,

291
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
and they were here,

292
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,860
and Titus had this responsibility of setting an order

293
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,780
and helping the church there to go forward,

294
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,580
and we find that there were many unruly,

295
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,180
that carries with it the idea of being disobedient

296
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,260
and vain talkers, again, we saw that reference in Ephesians

297
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,740
with regard to the vain words, they're void of truth,

298
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,180
and then he says, and deceivers.

299
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,740
Did you notice that it says there are many?

300
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,260
Do you know that Crete was not a very large place?

301
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,780
It's not a very large place.

302
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,460
But there were many.

303
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,580
There were many.

304
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,260
Let's look at 2 Peter chapter number two.

305
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Look at the three verses that begin this passage of Scripture.

306
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
In 2 Peter chapter number two,

307
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,260
the believers that are being addressed in 1 Peter

308
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,260
are in need of encouragement.

309
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
We find that in the book of 2 Peter,

310
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
they're in need of instruction.

311
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,260
By the way, we find ourselves in both of those scenarios,

312
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
do we not?

313
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Many times in our lives that we're in need of encouragement

314
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
and we're in need of instruction,

315
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
and I'm thankful that the Word of God

316
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,260
satisfies both of those needs.

317
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,260
It instructs us and it encourages us.

318
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
In verse number one of 2 Peter two, it says,

319
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,260
but there were false prophets also among the people.

320
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,260
That's a statement of fact based upon the Old Testament.

321
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,260
There were false prophets also among the people.

322
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
That was undisputed.

323
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,260
We understand you can go back to the Old Testament

324
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,260
and you can see the false prophets that existed

325
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
and all that took place.

326
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
It says here,

327
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,260
even as there shall be false teachers among you.

328
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,260
And he tells us that these false teachers who privily

329
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,260
shall bring in damnable heresies,

330
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,260
even denying the Lord that bought them

331
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,260
and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

332
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,260
And many shall follow their pernicious ways

333
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,260
by reason of whom the way of truth

334
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,260
shall be evil spoken of.

335
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,260
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words

336
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
make merchandise of you

337
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,260
whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not

338
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,260
and their damnation slumbereth not.

339
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
We see the conduct that is given as a description here

340
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,260
of these false teachers that would be among us.

341
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,260
And though the word deceive in our English language

342
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
is not listed here,

343
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,260
no doubt we find that it's through deception

344
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,260
that they bring in these damnable heresies

345
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
that are spoken of in verse number two.

346
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
It's through their deception.

347
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,540
that many would follow their pernicious ways.

348
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,380
And we find that it's referenced in v. 3

349
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,220
that through covetousness,

350
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,980
they shall with feigned words

351
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,660
make merchandise of you.

352
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,460
Feigned words. That's false words.

353
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,180
As we begin to look at all of these verses

354
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,660
of Scripture this evening,

355
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,460
I believe that it's very easy for us

356
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,020
to identify and acknowledge

357
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,060
that we're living in a time of deception.

358
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,940
That there is the reality of deception.

359
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,180
I don't like to be lied to. Do you?

360
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,620
I don't like to be deceived.

361
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,100
If I'm deceived, and then I find out,

362
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,700
man, it bothers me. Amen?

363
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,780
I don't like to be deceived.

364
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,380
And we find that God warns us

365
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,060
that there's going to be this deception,

366
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,940
this danger of deception,

367
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,780
and we see it so prevalent in our society today.

368
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,100
One of the things that bothers me so greatly

369
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,860
about this idea of deception

370
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,700
is that we're living in a society

371
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,580
in which they're very orchestrated

372
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,100
and they're very purposed

373
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,820
in their attempt to deceive.

374
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,420
And you know what they're doing?

375
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,300
They're deceiving the little ones.

376
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,180
They're targeting the youngest.

377
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,340
They're using the classroom

378
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,420
as a means of deception.

379
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,300
We find that we're living in a time

380
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,660
in a society in which

381
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,540
they are using the classroom

382
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,740
and they're using the teachers to deceive.

383
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,540
And these little children

384
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,380
are going to school,

385
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,980
and the people that we have

386
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,340
historically and traditionally

387
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,060
look to with some level of honor and respect

388
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,580
of filling a role of being teacher

389
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,540
that is respected and trusted,

390
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,220
now that person is deceiving.

391
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,420
It's crafty.

392
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,020
That's what we're dealing with.

393
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
And all of a sudden,

394
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Johnny and Susie come home from school

395
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,380
and the parents have taught their children

396
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,980
to respect the authority

397
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,820
and to respect the teacher,

398
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
and the teacher's seeking to teach you

399
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,220
that two plus two is four,

400
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,020
but there are other motives

401
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
that are going on,

402
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,220
and you just begin to read about

403
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,740
the curriculum that's going on

404
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,940
in our society today,

405
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,420
and you begin to do some research

406
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,460
about the Department of Education

407
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
and all that's taking place,

408
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
and what you're going to find

409
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,780
is that there is an agenda

410
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,820
to deceive the masses

411
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,900
through the children.

412
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,500
By the way, this is nothing new.

413
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
You can study history

414
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,060
and find that this has happened many times.

415
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,260
They target the young minds of children,

416
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
and they stand up

417
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,620
with a certain amount of authority

418
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,900
and a certain measure of confidence

419
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,780
and they're persuasive.

420
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,180
And again, little Johnny and Susie

421
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
are sitting in the class

422
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,300
and they're supposed to listen

423
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,100
and respect the teacher.

424
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,660
Satan is working.

425
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,140
And then we try to preach the truth

426
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,460
of God's Word to them

427
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,580
and their mind is so filled with deception

428
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,340
that has been given to them

429
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,220
over and over and over again

430
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,660
by people that are in places of authority

431
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,100
that it's almost as if

432
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,260
there's no room for truth.

433
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,940
It is a dangerous situation.

434
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,180
That's why we as parents

435
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
must be involved

436
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,780
in the education of our children.

437
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,820
It is absolutely essential.

438
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
You know that if you read

439
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,660
the entirety of the Word of God,

440
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,940
that there's only one group of people

441
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,260
that were ever made responsible

442
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,980
for teaching their children.

443
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,500
Parents.

444
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Cover to cover,

445
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Genesis to Revelation,

446
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,660
there's only one group of people.

447
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,580
I understand that not everyone

448
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
can homeschool.

449
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,300
I understand that.

450
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
But I am suggesting

451
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,740
that everyone ought to be involved

452
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,180
in the education of their children

453
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,420
because our children are being deceived.

454
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,580
Do you know that it's a lot easier

455
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,780
for them to deceive your child

456
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,980
than for them to deceive you?

457
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,180
It's a whole lot easier.

458
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
And then all of a sudden

459
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,300
your kids are teenagers

460
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,020
and they have these ideas

461
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
and you say,

462
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,260
where did you get this from?

463
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,900
Years of indoctrination.

464
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
The danger.

465
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Listen, it's a reality

466
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,779
that we're living in.

467
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,140
We see the reality of deception

468
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,260
quickly this evening.

469
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,140
The remedy for deception.

470
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,660
What is the remedy?

471
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,059
Well, we find that Jesus said,

472
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,180
take heed to have discernment,

473
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,380
to be aware, to see,

474
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,740
to be aware of what's going on.

475
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,180
But I believe that in one simple word,

476
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,980
the remedy for deception is truth.

477
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,500
It's truth.

478
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,300
We must know truth.

479
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,220
We must teach our children truth.

480
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,100
You read Deuteronomy 6,

481
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,420
I mean, when they're coming and going

482
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,900
and sleeping,

483
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,820
I mean, just every part of your day,

484
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,180
every opportunity,

485
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
you're giving truth,

486
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
you're giving truth,

487
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,900
you're giving truth.

488
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
It's reinforced.

489
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,460
I was chatting with someone

490
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,980
at the conference that we're at

491
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
there at the Beacon Rally

492
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
and we were speaking about

493
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,740
the great hymns of the faith

494
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,300
and we spoke and said

495
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,380
how one of the wonderful things

496
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,820
about the great hymns of the faith

497
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,779
is that they reinforce Bible truth.

498
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,380
And you can take these hymns

499
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,779
and our hymnal

500
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,940
and you could preach a message

501
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,100
through the words of those songs.

502
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Why?

503
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,980
Because they're founded upon biblical truth.

504
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,420
One of the songs that we sang,

505
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
just a little chorus,

506
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,020
nothing is impossible with God.

507
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,779
How do we know that?

508
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:03,619
Because the Bible says it.

509
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:04,619
Amen?

510
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:05,619
And then you put it to words

511
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:06,619
and you start singing it

512
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,900
and then all of a sudden,

513
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,820
you're reminding yourself repeatedly

514
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,900
that nothing's impossible with my God

515
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,460
because He's omnipotent,

516
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,180
because He can do all things.

517
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,020
And so we find that we must know truth.

518
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,380
I mentioned already

519
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,980
in Ephesians 4

520
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,700
where He said they lie and wait to deceive.

521
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
The very next verse in verse number 15

522
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,820
says that we're to speak the truth in love.

523
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,540
Truth is always the answer to error.

524
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Always.

525
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,140
And the problem is that

526
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,860
there is a lack of knowledge of truth

527
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,940
or a lack of courage to stand for truth.

528
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,020
Notice what Jesus said in John 8.

529
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,779
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

530
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,180
In John 8,

531
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,020
in verse number 32,

532
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,500
the Lord Jesus Christ said this,

533
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,460
and ye shall know the truth

534
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,220
and the truth shall make you free.

535
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,900
Jesus declared in the 14th chapter of the book of John,

536
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,619
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

537
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,100
As He prays before He would go to the cross

538
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,059
in John 17,

539
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:27,260
in verse number 17,

540
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,660
He says, sanctify them through Thy truth.

541
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,580
Thy Word is truth.

542
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,980
God has given us truth.

543
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,820
And truth is the remedy to deception.

544
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,540
For many, many years,

545
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,660
Baptist people had been referred to

546
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,820
and spoken of as being people of the book.

547
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,300
That's a good statement.

548
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,740
It did not originate as being complimentary.

549
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:09,860
We look into the history and understand the origins.

550
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,020
But it's a good statement when someone says

551
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,700
you're a person, the Baptists are people of the book.

552
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,779
Why do they reject what the state church says?

553
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,300
Because what the state church says

554
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,500
doesn't line up with what the book says.

555
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,860
So we stand on what the book says.

556
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,260
Amen?

557
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,900
And so we have to know the truth.

558
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,820
Where is the reality of deception?

559
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:41,540
We are living in an age of deception.

560
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,220
It's a reality.

561
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,380
And we can't put our head in the sand.

562
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,540
But there's a remedy, and it's truth.

563
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,820
And that's why it's so imperative

564
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,140
that we're in this book.

565
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,979
Amen?

566
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,820
God's given it to us.

567
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,780
What sad state we are in

568
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,500
when we don't know the truth

569
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
and we believe a lie.

570
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,340
He says, let no man deceive you.

571
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,380
How am I going to let no one deceive me?

572
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,820
I better know the book.

573
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,460
I better know the truth.

574
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,220
And when that deception comes,

575
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,739
I'm able to combat that with

576
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,460
here's what God says.

577
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,059
Here's what God's Word says.

578
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,859
And that's so essential in the age in which we're living.

579
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:27,780
Father, we love You.

580
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,859
We thank You for loving us.

581
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,059
We thank You for Your Word.

582
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,580
I pray that over the next several weeks

583
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,419
as we examine various portions of Scripture

584
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,940
with regard to the subject of deception,

585
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,460
that You would guide us and direct us,

586
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,260
that You would help us.

587
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,820
Lord, I pray that You would help us

588
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,460
to be people of the book,

589
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,619
standing on truth.

590
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,419
Would You help us to not only know the truth,

591
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,540
but to have the courage to stand for truth?

592
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,739
We live in this age of deception

593
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,739
and the reality of deception.

594
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,459
deception is all around us.

595
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:08,619
I'm so thankful this evening that You've given us the remedy, that You've given us a perfect

596
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:15,219
preserved book as the answers that we need.

597
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:21,179
We pray that You'd bless our time of prayer, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

598
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,099
Does anyone not get a prayer bulletin that needs one this evening?
