1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
I mentioned this morning that I'd be preaching from this passage of Scripture and

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,819
The title of the message is from verse number 12. I mentioned that this morning as well. Think it not strange

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,940
Think it not strange as we look here in first Peter chapter number four. I'm going to read the text of Scripture

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,719
We'll get into the message

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,959
But as you study the book of first Peter you will find and understand that Peter is seeking

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,280
to minister to those who are enduring trials and

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,119
There are people that have been dealing with much adversity and much opposition

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,439
In fact as you begin looking in the first chapter you find that he says to the strangers that are scattered throughout Pontus Galatia

9
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:48,799
Cappadocia Asia Bithynia and there's this disbursement amongst these followers of Christ and as he's writing to these of course

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,639
The Roman Emperor at the time is Nero and by the way, if you know anything about history

11
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:57,200
he was not very favorable towards God's people and

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,880
You will find that they were dealing with much adversity and much difficulty

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,839
And so God would use Peter to be able to send this letter

14
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:10,559
Of course as even as I mentioned this morning all Scripture is given by inspiration of God

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,120
But God gave the opportunity for Peter to write this letter

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,279
And of course, there are two epistles first and second Peter

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,199
That he was used to be the human penman of but if you notice in chapter 4 and verse number 12

18
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:28,239
The Bible says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial

19
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,599
Which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,319
but rejoice and as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that

21
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,639
When his glory shall be revealed

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,639
You may be glad also with exceeding joy

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,440
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ

24
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,040
Happy are ye

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,279
For the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part. He is evil spoken of but on your part

26
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,800
He is glorified

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,239
But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer

28
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,440
Or as a busybody and other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Let him not be ashamed

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,639
But let him glorify God on this behalf

31
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:23,199
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
And if it first begin at us

33
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:29,679
What shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

35
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,279
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,559
commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
unto a faithful

38
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,559
creator

39
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:51,559
Again, Peter is seeking to encourage these that are dealing with

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,440
Enduring these trials and we find that he gives them good information

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,600
I mean helpful truth that is revealed in this passage of Scripture and as I begin to dig into the fourth chapter

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
I think it would be

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Necessary in the very beginning of this message to go back to the first chapter and look at a few verses

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,039
That he Peter gives these believers in in the first

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,880
Verses 6 through 9 of chapter 1 we notice some truth that is given at the onset of this letter

46
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:24,679
With regard to that which they are enduring that which they are dealing with notice in verse number 6

47
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:31,320
Again in first Peter chapter 1 beginning in verse number 6 wherein ye greatly rejoice

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,559
Though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,440
That is that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth

50
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:52,360
Though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
unspeakable and full of glory

53
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,440
receiving the end of your faith even

54
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,639
The salvation of your souls

55
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,799
As being to look at the these two passages of Scripture and go back to the fourth chapter if you will of first Peter

56
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,799
I want you to note first of all the encouragement from Peter

57
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,040
I want you to know how that the Apostle Peter is going to encourage these

58
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:30,359
Believers that are enduring trials. They're dealing with opposition with difficulty

59
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:36,959
The adversity is real in their lives and Peter is going to be used of God to encourage them

60
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:45,040
As we walk through several verses here in first Peter chapter number four will make note as to how Peter is seeking to encourage them

61
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,519
Of course

62
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,720
He's building upon the truth that he gave them in the first chapter in those few verses that we just read

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,880
You note that he says that if for a season if need be

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,399
That you're in manifold or in heaviness, excuse me through manifold temptations

65
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:09,480
But he tells them that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth and we find that Peter is helping

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
these

67
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:18,239
Believers through the encouragement that he will provide them with he's helping them to develop a biblical perspective

68
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:23,160
and it is necessary for us as the children of God to have a

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,119
Biblical perspective when you begin to deal with

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
difficulties and begin to deal with

71
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
adversities and trials and you're

72
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:37,000
Enduring these hardships when you're looking. I mean you notice how Peter refers to it in verse number 12 of chapter 4

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,640
he says that this is a fiery trial a

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,640
fiery trial and if we have a

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
biblical perspective

76
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,040
With regard to the trials that we are going to endure as the people of God it

77
00:05:53,799 --> 00:06:00,839
Absolutely will enable us to respond properly to those trials if we do not have a biblical

78
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,200
Perspective if we begin to deal with hardships and trials and adversities

79
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,980
The devil is going to work you over

80
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,359
He's gonna come and he's gonna say God doesn't really love you

81
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,920
God doesn't really care about you

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,399
And if God did love you, then this isn't gonna happen and you're not gonna have to deal with that

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Get thee behind me Satan. Amen, because we need to develop a biblical worldview a biblical perspective

84
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,200
especially with regard to trials and

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,079
Adversity in these things that we would endure we understand if we were to read the whole of Scripture that you will find

86
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:43,839
That those that went before us those that sought to accomplish something for God those who are willing to go and follow

87
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,600
The Lord Jesus Christ they face difficulty. There's opposition. There's adversity along the path

88
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:58,000
But it does not mean that God has forsaken us. It does not mean that God does not love us. We must never

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,440
forget that God loves us with an

90
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,720
Unconditional love with an everlasting love we understand there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God

91
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,119
We understand that God knows listen Matthew chapter number 10 talks about the fact that he knows the the number of hairs upon your head

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,920
He's got a subtract for me

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,600
He might have to add for some of you, but the reality is that God knows everything about us and he loves us

94
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,839
And

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,239
Casting all your care upon him why he careth for you

96
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,160
God loves us and when we're in the midst of a trial if we do not have a

97
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,119
Biblical perspective it is very likely it is very possible that we respond

98
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,000
wrong to that trial to that adversity

99
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:55,679
So we find that as the as Peter is seeking to encourage these believers that through this encouragement

100
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,239
He's helping them to develop this biblical perspective

101
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,239
And and also not only to understand and to develop this biblical perspective

102
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:08,679
But also to recognize that God has a purpose in trials

103
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:13,760
See, sometimes we'd like to think that it'd be better if we could live through life with no adversity

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,600
If we could go through our entire life and never have a problem never have a trouble that it'd just be wonderful

105
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,399
God has a purpose in trials. Amen

106
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:31,239
Brother Mark preached about the storm last Sunday morning

107
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:38,080
And Jesus said let us go to the other side and he and I were talking on Wednesday a little bit about that

108
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
The reality is that Jesus as God

109
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,119
Being omniscient knowing all things he could have said let's not go yet because there's gonna be a storm

110
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,679
he told him to go right in the midst of knowing there's gonna be a storm and

111
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:59,320
The reality is that when we understand this evening that God has a purpose in trials

112
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:05,760
Could you imagine how different our Bible would be if there were no trials that the people of God faced?

113
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,840
It would simply be a book of theory

114
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
But it's a practical book

115
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,159
It's not just a theory that God is always with us

116
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not just a theory that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think

117
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,039
It's not just a theory that he's with us through whatever the the difficulty the trial the circumstance may be that he can deliver us

118
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,039
Through it. No, we have

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,200
passages of Scripture that we can run to and we can be encouraged by

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,739
Understanding that God did not simply declare that he's all-powerful, but he

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,719
Demonstrated that he's all-powerful. And if there were never any troubles if there were no problems if there were no adversities

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,440
How's God showing his power? It's just a book of theory

123
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:59,719
I'm thankful that the Bible is not just a book of theory. The Bible is a practical book. I'm thankful

124
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,219
that there are some young Hebrew boys

125
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,939
that were willing to go into a fiery furnace

126
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,479
that we read about in Daniel chapter number 3,

127
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,519
that they believed that God was able,

128
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,239
that they said to Nebuchadnezzar

129
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,939
in all of his power, in all of his ability,

130
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,239
they said, we're not going to bow down.

131
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:21,579
I mean, really, I'd love to have been there.

132
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,319
Nebuchadnezzar thinks he's going to do him a favor.

133
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,879
We're going to play the music again for you.

134
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,079
And they said, well, you can play it

135
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,879
until the cows come home, so to speak,

136
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,419
but we're not going to bow.

137
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,619
That's in the Hebrew somewhere.

138
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,759
But you understand that if that passage isn't there,

139
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,119
Nebuchadnezzar never says, there's no God like your God.

140
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:51,319
Without that trial, without that difficulty,

141
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:56,079
what about Darius in Daniel chapter number 6?

142
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:59,519
He says, I know your God's able to deliver thee.

143
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,719
Daniel, has your God delivered thee?

144
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,799
Yes, O king.

145
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,839
But Daniel had to go into den of lions.

146
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,679
Amen?

147
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,159
And we look through the Word of God,

148
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,559
and we find that Peter is seeking to encourage

149
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,639
these that are enduring trials.

150
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,999
And he says, listen, as I provide this encouragement to you,

151
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:24,359
I'm trying to help you to develop a biblical perspective

152
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,079
to recognize that there is a purpose in trials.

153
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,519
And look at what he says in 1 Peter 4.

154
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,879
Notice in verse number 12.

155
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,119
He says, beloved.

156
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:34,919
Now, that's good.

157
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,239
We mentioned already that God loves us.

158
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,279
So he refers to them in verse number 12, beloved.

159
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,319
And what a mindful thing that we are loved by our God.

160
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,839
And of course, the love that we have

161
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,519
as brethren, one for another.

162
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,679
He says, think it not strange.

163
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,679
Don't think this to be an odd thing, an unusual thing.

164
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:00,039
Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, which

165
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,199
is to try you.

166
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,319
Notice what he says.

167
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:07,039
As though some strange thing happened unto you.

168
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,519
You know that you're not the first one to ever have a trial.

169
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,919
And you're not going to be the last one.

170
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,119
And most likely, the trial that you're in

171
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,639
isn't going to be the last one.

172
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,679
I mean, we know.

173
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,599
There are going to be trials.

174
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,399
There are going to be adversities, difficulties

175
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,679
that we're going to deal with.

176
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,079
And he says, don't think this to be odd or strange or unusual,

177
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,559
that this thing has happened unto you.

178
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,039
It's very interesting when I read

179
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,279
that verse in verse number 12.

180
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,319
And I think about the words of Scripture

181
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:41,799
and I begin to understand even that which others have said.

182
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,239
He says, as though some strange thing happened unto you.

183
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,799
Hold your place there and go back

184
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,959
to the book of Philippians, if you will.

185
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,919
And I want you to notice what Paul says here

186
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,919
in the book of Philippians.

187
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,399
Again, allow your mind to think about that phrase

188
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,359
when he says, happened unto you.

189
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,519
Do you ever wonder why this has happened to you?

190
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,519
I mean, maybe you're in the midst of something.

191
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,519
You say, I don't know why this is happening.

192
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,239
I don't know why this is going on.

193
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,639
I don't know why I have to deal with this.

194
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,479
Or maybe you say something like I say,

195
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,519
I don't have time for this.

196
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,399
Honestly, you ever have a difficulty and say,

197
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,279
I just don't have time for this.

198
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,999
This is not, I didn't plan for this.

199
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,679
Yeah, but God knew you needed it.

200
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,679
Look at what Paul says in Philippians one,

201
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,959
in verse number 12, but I would,

202
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,279
ye should understand, brethren,

203
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,279
that the things which happened unto me

204
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,159
have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.

205
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,679
Paul's saying these things that have happened unto me.

206
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,999
The things that he was enduring.

207
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,279
He's writing the book of Philippians,

208
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,399
by the way, from prison.

209
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,839
He's saying the things that have happened unto me.

210
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,239
Remember, he says, Peter says,

211
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,239
as though some strange thing happened unto you.

212
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,839
Paul says there's some things that happened unto me,

213
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,799
but I want you believers in Philippi to understand

214
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,959
that those things that have happened unto me

215
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,719
have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.

216
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,039
God has a purpose in it.

217
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,599
God has a plan in it.

218
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,039
And there are some times that things will happen

219
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,359
in our lives, and we need not to think

220
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,759
that it's some strange thing that's happened unto us.

221
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,679
Understanding that we serve a God who is sovereign,

222
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,199
that is all powerful, that is all knowing,

223
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,399
and He has plan and purpose in these things.

224
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,199
In verse 13 of 1 Peter 4,

225
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,199
notice the first two words, but rejoice.

226
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,559
If we'd be honest this evening,

227
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,159
when we're dealing with a fiery trial,

228
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,319
and I'm not sure that most of the trials

229
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,319
that any of us have endured

230
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,759
would qualify as being a fiery trial.

231
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,679
Maybe some, but not most.

232
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,439
But rejoice.

233
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,479
How often when we face a trial

234
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,599
is our first response to that trial to rejoice?

235
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,559
How often is it that we have that attitude

236
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,799
of Brother Caldwell's children to say,

237
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,279
I wonder how God's gonna work this time?

238
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,439
What faith?

239
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,279
This trial has come in my life,

240
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,999
and I wonder how God's gonna manifest His power,

241
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,399
how He's gonna demonstrate and reveal to me

242
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,159
His purpose, how He's going to develop me through this,

243
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,159
how He's going to use me to be able to influence

244
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,479
and impact others as a result of this trial.

245
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,999
But rejoice.

246
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,519
And as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings.

247
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,039
Now you understand that suffering always comes before glory.

248
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,639
Amen?

249
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,759
Go back, if you will.

250
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,079
Well, let's just stay here in 1 Peter just for a moment.

251
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,999
We'll go back to chapter number two and look in verse 21.

252
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,719
It says, for even here unto where ye called,

253
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:20,959
because Christ also suffered for us,

254
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,119
leaving us an example that ye should follow His steps.

255
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,879
Here He says that we're to rejoice,

256
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,639
and as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings.

257
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,439
Now, again, I want you to hold your place here

258
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,239
and look in the book of Philippians.

259
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,639
This is good.

260
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,279
It's good because it's Bible.

261
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,399
It's not good because it's coming from me.

262
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,039
It's good because it's Bible.

263
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,959
God helped me, and I hope it helps you tonight.

264
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,159
In Philippians chapter number three,

265
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,439
I am guilty, even as I said this morning in James 5,

266
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,399
of often quoting the last part of the verse.

267
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,199
Here, I'm often guilty of quoting

268
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
the first part of the verse.

269
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,359
That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection.

270
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:04,199
I like that part, but Philippians 3.10 says

271
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,839
that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection

272
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:11,879
and the fellowship of His sufferings,

273
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,399
being made conformable unto His death.

274
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,039
What did Peter say about these trials,

275
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,159
this fiery trial that these believers were enduring,

276
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,319
that they were dealing with?

277
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,519
He says, but rejoice.

278
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,339
Why?

279
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:32,339
And as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering.

280
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,399
How in the world would we ever imagine

281
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,279
that our Savior suffered,

282
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,679
but yet we're not gonna deal with any suffering?

283
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,239
Amen?

284
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:50,239
Jesus said, if they hate you, they hated me first.

285
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,319
Right, is that what He said?

286
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,799
Don't be surprised by it.

287
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,599
And the reality is that we see that yes,

288
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,479
there's suffering, and suffering comes before glory.

289
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:04,079
Notice, if you skip back over to 1 Peter,

290
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,479
we're gonna get back to verse 13,

291
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:08,679
but look down to chapter five in verse number one.

292
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:09,519
The Bible says this,

293
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,679
the elders which are among you I exhort,

294
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,679
who am also an elder,

295
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,119
and a witness of what?

296
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,319
Of the sufferings of Christ.

297
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,079
And also a partaker of the glory,

298
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,239
what does it say?

299
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,039
That shall be revealed.

300
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,679
Is that future, present, or past?

301
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,079
Future, that shall be revealed.

302
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,919
Listen, there was a time for Christ to suffer,

303
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,959
and He did.

304
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,839
And He said in John 17

305
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,199
that He would receive the glory that was due, right?

306
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,639
That He enjoyed from the beginning,

307
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,879
from the foundation of the world.

308
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:49,279
But we find that, I've often mentioned

309
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,959
that the first time He came,

310
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:54,159
He came to pay for our sin, He came to suffer.

311
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,319
When He comes again, He's not coming to suffer.

312
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,759
He's coming in all of His glory, in all of His power.

313
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,079
I understand when you consider

314
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,799
the second coming of Christ,

315
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,959
there are two aspects of the second coming of Christ.

316
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,719
The rapture, followed by seven years of tribulation,

317
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:11,639
and then the return of Christ when He comes.

318
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,759
And you look at that, and you look in Revelation 19,

319
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,759
you begin to study that.

320
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,879
He is coming as the conquering King.

321
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,599
He suffered, and there's gonna be glory.

322
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,959
Listen, for us, do you understand that glory

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is not necessarily something

324
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,239
that we need to long for here on this earth?

325
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,319
There's gonna be some suffering.

326
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,000
And I understand we don't like to suffer.

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,359
I don't like to suffer.

328
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,039
I like being comfortable.

329
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,319
If you don't, you should go talk to someone.

330
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,679
Honestly, I like to be comfortable.

331
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,599
But we're trying to develop a biblical perspective

332
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,839
and understanding that God in His...

333
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:08,219
omniscience. If need be, you have this trial, you have this difficulty, and

334
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:15,339
rejoice. But rejoice, notice back in verse 13, but rejoice why? In as much as you

335
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,819
are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, again

336
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,479
future tense you see here in verse number or chapter 5 verse 1 as we

337
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:27,579
mentioned ago a moment ago, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. Do you see

338
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:34,159
the words that are used? Glad, exceeding joy. Verse number 14, if ye be reproached

339
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,359
for the name of Christ, happy are ye, blessed are ye. You say man that's not

340
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,559
how I feel if I'm reproached for Christ. Again we're trying to develop this

341
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,559
perspective. Peter's trying to encourage these, listen these folks were suffering,

342
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,719
dealing with some serious trials. God's gonna use Peter to encourage them.

343
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:03,099
Verse 14, if you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the

344
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:08,299
spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of,

345
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:13,879
but on your part he is glorified. Notice verse 15, but let none of you suffer as a

346
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:17,839
murderer, as a thief, or as an evildoer, as a busybody in other men's matters. In

347
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,439
other words, look, if you're suffering because of some wrongdoing, don't try to

348
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:24,879
think that you're supposed to rejoice in that and glory God and all that. That's

349
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:30,119
a different kind of suffering. And Peter wants to make sure that these believers

350
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,239
understand that the suffering that we're speaking about is when you're suffering

351
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:38,359
for Christ because you're doing what you're supposed to do, not because of

352
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:46,319
some wrongdoing on your part. Verse 16, yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let

353
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:54,119
him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf. Notice the truth of

354
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,839
verse 17 and following. He says, for the time has come that judgment must begin

355
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,719
at the house of God, and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of

356
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:11,599
them that obey not the gospel of God? Begin to find here some truth with

357
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,799
regard to these trials and the purpose in these trials, and we understand that

358
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,479
he speaks about this judgment that must begun first at the house of God, and

359
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:28,079
really God would use these to purify and to purge the child of God. And that's

360
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,839
the work that God's doing through it, and it's a purifying work, it's a purging

361
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,439
work. He says, if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey

362
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:43,199
not the gospel of God? The reality is that the worst thing that we could

363
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:48,919
suffer here upon this earth is the worst thing we're ever going to suffer. We have

364
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,279
all of eternity with our Savior if we're saved, and what glory is going to

365
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,239
be. Do you know for a lost man the the greatest pleasure that they're ever

366
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:03,759
going to enjoy is the pleasure that they can have here upon earth? Because for all

367
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,839
of eternity there's going to be judgment. That's a sad truth and ought to motivate

368
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:16,279
us and convict us to share the gospel with a lost and dying world, because only

369
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:20,039
the pleasures of this world, that's the only pleasure a lost person is ever

370
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:27,959
going to know. You consider the the fiery trial for the believer and how the

371
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:32,919
fire will purify and purge, but you think about the unbelievers, he says at the

372
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,119
end of verse number 17, and what shall be the end be of them that obey not the

373
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,639
gospel of God? If the righteous scarcely be saved, verse 18, where shall the

374
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,719
ungodly and the sinner appear? We know the great white throne judgment tells us

375
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:49,479
if you read Revelation chapter number 20, and death and hell were cast in the

376
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:56,799
lake of fire, this is the second death. And that fire is a fire of judgment,

377
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,479
it's punishment, it's eternal judgment. Aren't you thankful that the second

378
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:07,039
death has no power over you if you've trusted Christ as your Savior? And we

379
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,959
find this evening that as we look at this trial and look at these situations

380
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:16,279
and we understand, let me read verse 19, wherefore let them that suffer according

381
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,439
to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto

382
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:24,119
a faithful creator. He is the creator of the universe and he is

383
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,279
faithful. And we are to commit, notice what it says, commit the keeping of their

384
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,559
souls to him in well-doing. We commit ourselves to him. I want you to think

385
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,319
with me this evening about a fire. You know that fire burns straw but purifies

386
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:48,719
gold. It burns straw but it purifies gold. You think about the sun. The sun will

387
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:56,639
melt the snow but harden the clay. Same sun. Think about a pot of boiling water.

388
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:02,879
You know they say that a watch pot never boils. We wanted a boiling pot this

389
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:07,319
afternoon quickly. Why? Because part of our lunch was going to be some noodles

390
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,039
that were going to go with our lunch. And those enriched pasta noodles, they're

391
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,799
hard, they'll break your teeth. But you put them in boiling water and what

392
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:21,999
happens to them? They soften. But you put an egg in boiling water and what happens?

393
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:28,879
It hardens. See, God will use a fiery trial in our lives and if our hearts

394
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:33,759
right and we have a right perspective, he'll develop us through it. He'll teach

395
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:40,959
us truth about him that we can only learn in the midst of that trial. I spoke

396
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:47,919
with a man on Thursday. I never heard his full story until Thursday. I had heard

397
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,519
parts of his story in the past and I won't get into all the details. But about

398
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,479
14 years ago he suffered a horrific tragedy in his life from man's

399
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:04,079
perspective. And he stood before us and he said, I had already been a Christian

400
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,779
at that point in my life. I had trusted Christ years prior. I had been walking

401
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:13,519
with God. If you were to ask me if I was trusting the Lord, I would say yes. I was

402
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,759
teaching Sunday school. But he came home from church on a Sunday and he faced a

403
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:26,839
horrific tragedy. And here's what he said. God became real in that moment. He said,

404
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:33,599
I grew closer to God as a result of that moment than I had ever been to God.

405
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,759
See, sometimes there are things that we can just learn about God in the midst of

406
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,559
a trial. If those fishermen, if Peter and James and John and the other disciples

407
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,719
that are on the boat, to go back to Mark's message from Sunday morning, if

408
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:52,119
there was no storm, would they have ever known that Jesus could calm the storm?

409
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:58,119
What did they say? What matter of man is this? That even the winds and the waves

410
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:06,879
obey? Is that not what the Scriptures say? Well, if they never see him do it, it's theory.

411
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:14,719
We serve a God of application, a practical, truthful God. We think about

412
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:21,159
the note, if you will, the encouragement from Peter. But now I want you to

413
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,759
consider with me the experience of Peter, lest we think that Peter is

414
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,239
speaking to these that are suffering and dealing with this fiery trial, and they

415
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:35,239
might sit back, as has been my case on more than one occasion, and say, well, you

416
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:44,079
just don't understand. People will say that to you. They do. Peter understood what he was

417
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,639
talking about. We understand it's Scripture, it's God's Word. But I want you

418
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:52,079
to consider the experience of Peter just for a few moments. Go back to the

419
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,559
book of Acts, if you will. There are times in which I've had people tell me when I've

420
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,959
sought to counsel them that I just have never experienced what they've

421
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:08,079
experienced, and therefore I'm not qualified to counsel them. I understand

422
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,599
what they mean by that. I've often responded to them, and I've said this,

423
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,719
that if my counsel is based upon the Word of God, then you have to take the

424
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:22,639
counsel of God's Word. Whether I have experienced the same hardship as you

425
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:29,759
have or not, what does the Word of God say? But Peter is encouraging some people

426
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,719
that are suffering, but he understood what it was to suffer. Peter had endured

427
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:41,999
some great difficulties. In Acts chapter number 4, of course, in chapter number 3

428
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:46,119
we don't have time to deal with it. Our time is running short this evening. But in Acts chapter number 3

429
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,159
there's a great miracle that takes place, and the lame man is healed. And in chapter

430
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,239
number 4, listen, there's a great difficulty that's going on here.

431
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:59,279
These religious leaders are all in an uproar and all that's going on, and they

432
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,679
don't like the preaching that's taking place. And in verse number 3, they laid

433
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,239
their hands on them. We understand Peter and John are the disciples that are

434
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,799
mentioned, the apostles in chapter number 3. They laid their hands on them, and they

435
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,799
put them in hold until the next day, for it was now eventide. And so with that

436
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,639
idea of being put in hold, they were put into the prison. And they're gonna bring

437
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:25,719
them out, and they're gonna find out all that was going on. And as you continue

438
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:28,339
reading through Acts chapter number 4, they're called before the religious

439
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:33,279
leaders, and Peter stands up with power and in the power of the Holy Spirit and

440
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,599
proclaims to them that it was not in his power, it was not in John's power. It was

441
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,159
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that this man was made whole, and that

442
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,719
there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby you must be saved. I

443
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:50,039
mean, he just went ahead and laid it on them and gave them Bible truth, and they

444
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,839
didn't like it. So you keep on going through Acts chapter number 4 and verse

445
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,839
number 17, it says, "...but that it spread no further among the people, let us..."

446
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,959
the religious leaders,

447
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,839
straightly threatened them

448
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,419
that they speak henceforth to no man

449
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,679
in this name.

450
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,579
And they called them and commanded them

451
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,179
not to speak at all nor teach

452
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:11,379
in the name of Jesus."

453
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,039
Now you understand that this group

454
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,539
of religious leaders, they had power.

455
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:18,919
They were the same ones that had put them in war

456
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:19,839
the night before.

457
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,339
They had power. They had authority.

458
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,539
But Peter and John, they answered in v. 19

459
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,539
and said unto them,

460
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,339
whether it be right in the sight of God

461
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,239
to hearken unto you more than unto God,

462
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,239
for we cannot but speak the things

463
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,739
which we have seen and heard.

464
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:36,239
Praise the Lord.

465
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,239
Continue to go through the book of Acts

466
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,239
and you see if you were to skip down

467
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,739
in v. 29, it says this,

468
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,239
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings.

469
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,239
I don't know all that they threatened,

470
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,439
but we find that they said,

471
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,939
let us straightly threaten them

472
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:51,939
that they may speak henceforth to no man in this name.

473
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:53,739
I'm pretty sure that the threat was not,

474
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:54,739
if you preach in His name,

475
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:56,739
we're going to slap you on the hand.

476
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,439
I just don't think that was the threat.

477
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,439
You understand, this was a serious situation.

478
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,939
In fact, in chapter 5,

479
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,939
they're ready to kill these guys.

480
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,139
We'll get there in just a moment,

481
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:08,439
but notice in chapter 4 and v. 29,

482
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,139
what their prayer is to the Lord

483
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:11,639
in response to the threatenings

484
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,439
is that they would be granted,

485
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,139
it says, and grant unto thy servants

486
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:19,139
that with all boldness they may speak thy word.

487
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,139
They're dealing with a difficulty,

488
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,639
but they say, we want to continue going on.

489
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,139
We want to continue to preach and teach

490
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:24,139
in the name of Jesus

491
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:26,639
because that's what we're commanded to do.

492
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,339
Chapter 5.

493
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:32,139
Look in v. 18, if you will.

494
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,339
V. 17 tells us how they were filled with indignation.

495
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:36,839
This again is the religious leaders,

496
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,339
the high priest is there,

497
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:40,139
and the sect of the Sadducees,

498
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,839
and it says that they say in v. 18,

499
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,839
they laid their hands on the apostles

500
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,839
and put them in the common prison.

501
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,839
And I love this passage of Scripture.

502
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,339
It says, but the angel of the Lord by night

503
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,339
opened the prison doors and brought them forth

504
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,339
and said, go, stand and speak in the temple

505
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,339
to the people all the words of this life.

506
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,039
And then it says in v. 21,

507
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,539
and when they heard that,

508
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:01,539
they entered into the temple early in the morning

509
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:03,039
and taught, but the high priest came

510
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,039
and they that were with him

511
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,539
and called the council together,

512
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,539
the senate of the children of Israel,

513
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,539
and sent to the prison to have them brought.

514
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,539
But when the officers came

515
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,039
and found them not in the prison,

516
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,539
they returned and said,

517
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:16,039
the prison truly found we shut with all safety

518
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,039
and the keeper standing without before the doors,

519
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,039
but when we had opened,

520
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,039
we found no man within.

521
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,039
Where are they?

522
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,039
What's going on?

523
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,239
And then this one comes in v. 25,

524
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,739
it says, then came one and told them,

525
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,739
saying, behold, the men whom you have put in prison

526
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,239
are standing in the temple

527
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,739
and teaching the people.

528
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,739
Isn't that awesome?

529
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:40,739
I love it.

530
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:43,739
You skip down, look in v. 28,

531
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:44,739
the Bible says this,

532
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:46,239
as they now have Peter and John

533
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,239
back in their presence,

534
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:50,239
and they said, did not we straightly command you

535
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,739
that you should not teach in this name?

536
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,939
And behold, you have filled Jerusalem

537
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,439
with your doctrine

538
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:59,439
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

539
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,439
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said,

540
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,439
we ought to obey God rather than men.

541
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:07,439
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus,

542
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,439
whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.

543
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,939
Him hath God exalted with His right hand

544
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,439
to be a prince and a Savior

545
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,939
for to give repentance to Israel

546
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:15,939
and forgiveness of sins.

547
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:19,939
And we are His witnesses of these things.

548
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:21,439
And so is also the Holy Ghost

549
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:23,639
whom God hath given to them that obey Him.

550
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:24,639
When they heard that,

551
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,639
they were cut to the heart

552
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,639
and took counsel to slay them.

553
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:33,639
It's getting more serious for the disciples.

554
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,639
Ready to kill them.

555
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,639
Gamaliel stands up and he says,

556
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:38,639
hey listen guys,

557
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:39,639
there's some other,

558
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,639
Jared and I were talking about this on Friday morning,

559
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,639
there's some other guys

560
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,639
that had come around here recently

561
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,639
and man their work just kind of fizzled out,

562
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:47,639
they had a little following

563
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,639
but nothing really came of it

564
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,839
and if this thing be a thing of men,

565
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,839
then it's just going to fizzle out.

566
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,839
But he says this,

567
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,839
if it be of God,

568
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,839
ye cannot overthrow it.

569
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,839
If God be for us,

570
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,839
who can be against us?

571
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,839
That's Bible.

572
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,839
That's just not some saying

573
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,839
that some person came up with.

574
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,839
We are more than conquerors through Christ.

575
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,839
Amen?

576
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:17,839
Notice as they agreed with Gamaliel,

577
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:20,039
God says in verse number 30,

578
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:23,039
let's look at verse 40,

579
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,039
and to him they agreed

580
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,039
and so just to understand context

581
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,039
it was these religious leaders,

582
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,039
they agreed with Gamaliel

583
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,039
that which he said

584
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,039
and when they had called the apostles,

585
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,039
look at these next three words,

586
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,039
and beaten them.

587
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,039
And beaten them.

588
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,039
They commanded that they should not speak

589
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,239
in the name of Jesus

590
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,239
and let them go.

591
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
And they,

592
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,239
now that's talking about those apostles

593
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,239
that were just beaten,

594
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,239
departed from the presence of the council,

595
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,239
what's the word in your Bible say?

596
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,239
Rejoicing.

597
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,239
What did Peter say in 1 Peter 4 verse 12 and 13?

598
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,239
He said look,

599
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,239
think it not strange concerning the fiery trial?

600
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,239
Verse 13 starts with these two words,

601
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,439
but rejoice.

602
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,439
Right?

603
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:19,439
But rejoice.

604
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,439
That's how he's encouraging them,

605
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,439
but that's what he did.

606
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,439
That's what he did.

607
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,439
The example,

608
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:28,439
notice this experience that he had,

609
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,439
it says here

610
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,439
that when they departed from the presence

611
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,439
of the council, verse 41,

612
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,439
they were rejoicing

613
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,439
that they were counted worthy

614
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,439
to suffer shame

615
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,439
for his name.

616
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,639
And by the way,

617
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,639
verse 42,

618
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,639
and daily in the temple

619
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,639
and in every house

620
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,639
they ceased not to teach and preach

621
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,639
Jesus Christ.

622
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,639
That's what got them in trouble in the first place.

623
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,639
Right?

624
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,639
Don't preach in his name,

625
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,639
don't speak in his name.

626
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,639
They said well,

627
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,639
you determine what you want to determine,

628
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,639
but this is what we're going to do.

629
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,639
Amen.

630
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,639
See Peter wasn't just trying to encourage

631
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,639
them from dealing with a fiery trial

632
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,639
without any experience himself.

633
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,639
He'd experienced

634
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,639
the opposition.

635
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,639
He had experienced

636
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,639
the trial.

637
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,639
He'd experienced the hardship.

638
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,639
And he rejoiced

639
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,639
that he was counted worthy

640
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,639
to suffer shame

641
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,639
for his name.

642
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,639
I spoke with someone yesterday

643
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,639
and as I had the conversation with the individual

644
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,639
he was sharing with me

645
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,639
some situation about some

646
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,639
believers from Russia that had

647
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,639
come over to the United States of America

648
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,639
and some of their assessment

649
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,639
of what the church in the United States of America

650
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,639
is like today versus what it's like

651
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,639
in Russia.

652
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,639
What are y'all scared about?

653
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,639
We had to meet underground and they're going to kill us.

654
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,639
Russia. That's what happens.

655
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,639
There's a

656
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,639
very well-known

657
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,639
account of a Russian preacher

658
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,639
that was

659
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,639
dealing with all sorts of

660
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,639
adversity and difficulty and

661
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,639
you know,

662
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,639
the enemy's wicked.

663
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,639
He just is.

664
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,639
The enemy is ruthless

665
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,639
and relentless.

666
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,639
And

667
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,639
in this particular situation

668
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,639
they had threatened this preacher in Russia

669
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,639
many, many times and

670
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,639
it just was like falling on deaf ears.

671
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,639
He just kept on doing what he was doing

672
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,639
and kept on serving God.

673
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,639
And so they got a couple

674
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,639
of his daughters.

675
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,639
They apprehended his daughters

676
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,639
and in his

677
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,639
presence

678
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,639
they're going to put hot irons in the ears

679
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,639
of his daughters and cause them to be deaf

680
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,639
permanently.

681
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,639
If he didn't stop.

682
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,639
I can't even imagine.

683
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,639
But you know what the daughters said?

684
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,639
Daddy?

685
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,639
Don't deny Jesus for us.

686
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,639
And those Russian men

687
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,639
stuck hot irons in the ears

688
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,639
of those young ladies.

689
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,639
Many years later

690
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,639
someone had heard that story

691
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,639
and was worshipping in that part

692
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,639
of the world and he noticed

693
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,639
as he was there that there was an interpreter

694
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,639
giving sign language.

695
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,639
And he went and spoke with them through the interpreter

696
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,639
and found out that they were the very daughters

697
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,639
of that preacher.

698
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,639
Still serving

699
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,639
God.

700
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,639
Still faithful.

701
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,639
Can you imagine?

702
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,639
Listen, there's some trials that we can face in life

703
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,639
but God is with us.

704
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,639
And the reality

705
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,639
is sometimes we just have to change our thinking.

706
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,639
We have this idea that

707
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,639
everything is going to be perfect in our lives.

708
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,639
No, the glory is

709
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,639
to come.

710
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,639
There might be some suffering

711
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,639
here. Our Savior suffered

712
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,639
greatly.

713
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,639
And there might be some suffering here.

714
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,639
I'm not interested in suffering.

715
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,639
But the reality

716
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,639
is that I better be prepared for it.

717
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,639
Because if I'm not

718
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,639
prepared for it, I'm certainly not going to respond

719
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,639
properly when it comes.

720
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,639
Acts chapter number 12 and we'll finish.

721
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,639
In Acts chapter number

722
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,639
12

723
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,639
Herod is on a

724
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,639
showing

725
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,639
his power

726
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,639
situation here. Of course by the end of the

727
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,639
chapter he's

728
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,639
killed by God and eaten by worms.

729
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,639
Didn't work out so well for Herod.

730
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,639
But here in the beginning

731
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,639
of the chapter, we find

732
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,639
that the record is given to us

733
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,639
about him raising his hand against

734
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,639
the devil.

735
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,799
church, it says in verse 1 of Acts 12, now about that time Herod the king stretched

736
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:10,599
forth his hands to vex certain of the church. What do the next words say? He

737
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:19,639
killed James. He killed him. He killed James, the brother of John with the sword.

738
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:26,599
And because he saw it pleased the Jews. I can't fully wrap my mind around that, I

739
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,519
can't think in that manner, but there's some people that hate God and hate God's

740
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:39,239
people. And it pleased them. So what did he do? He proceeded further to take Peter

741
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:44,999
also. What's he gonna do with Peter? The Bible tells us in parenthesis in verse

742
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,839
number 3, then were the days of unleavened bread. And when he had

743
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,799
apprehended him, he put him in prison, delivered him to four quarterians of

744
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:55,999
soldiers to keep him. Notice what it says, intending after Easter to bring him

745
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:01,879
forth to the people. What was he gonna do? He's gonna kill him. Peter therefore

746
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:05,559
was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God

747
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:11,639
for him. This morning we talked about intercessory prayer, the power of prayer.

748
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,599
You guys are praying. By the way, I don't have time to go through the whole

749
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,479
account. When Peter's knocking on the door, they're still in there praying, and

750
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:25,599
Rhoda's like, he's here, and they're like, you're crazy. No, no, it's him. They

751
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,719
finally let him in. Look at verse number 6. And when Herod would have brought him

752
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:40,239
forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two

753
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,919
chains, and the keepers before the door kept the prison. Behold, the angel of the

754
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:49,599
Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison. He smote Peter on the side

755
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,599
and raised him up. He was asleep good, amen? I mean, seriously, he's sleeping

756
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:03,519
good. The peace of God. Arise up quickly, and his chains fell off from his hands.

757
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:09,839
I don't have time to read all of it. Look in verse number 17. He, Peter, beckoning

758
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,999
unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord

759
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:16,879
had brought him out of the prison. He said, Go, show these things unto James

760
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:23,059
and the brethren. He departed and went into another place. This evening, as we

761
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,859
think about this passage of Scripture in 1st Peter, and the fiery trial in

762
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:34,339
which they were enduring, he says, think it not strange. Think it not strange. This

763
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:40,059
isn't something odd or unusual. Understand, as he had laid the foundation

764
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:45,019
in the first chapter, that wherein we greatly rejoice, though now for a season

765
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:49,259
if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations. These trials are

766
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:53,339
going to come in our lives, but we understand that through the

767
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,219
encouragement Peter is seeking to help these believers develop a biblical

768
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:05,139
perspective and to understand that God has a purpose, and that God's purpose is

769
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:12,619
not always for your comfort or mine. Do you believe this evening that God could

770
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:18,819
have allowed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego not to go into the fiery furnace?

771
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:24,139
He could have prevented it. Listen, he could have killed Nebuchadnezzar before

772
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:27,099
Nebuchadnezzar could give the order to put those boys in the in the fiery

773
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:31,379
furnace. Could he not? He could have caused an earthquake that could have

774
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:35,939
destroyed that whole fiery furnace and caused great chaos and confusion. He's

775
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:46,859
God. He could do anything, but he let him go in. He let him go in. And then

776
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:53,179
Nebuchadnezzar says, how many did we put in there? Three. We put them in their

777
00:43:53,179 --> 00:44:00,859
bound, and there's four walking around, and the fourth is like the Son of God.

778
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:09,339
And then he says, there's no God like their God. How are they gonna know what

779
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:17,659
our God is able to do? Sometimes it requires a trial, and in God's master

780
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:24,419
plan, sometimes it's okay if the trials come. I'll finish with a personal story. I

781
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:29,259
was looking through pictures last night to find out when it was, and it was

782
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:34,779
December 6, 2013. I remember the exact day because it was Holly's birthday. I

783
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:41,059
didn't remember the year. Not that particular year, her birthday was on a

784
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:46,659
Sunday, and after church went to Olive Garden. Went to Olive Garden, that's where

785
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:51,979
she wanted to go to have lunch for her birthday, and you know they ask if you

786
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:57,939
want soup or salad. Got the salad. I was eating salad, not even a crouton. That

787
00:44:57,939 --> 00:45:04,579
would have been a good story, but it was just lettuce, and my tooth cracked as I

788
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:12,339
was eating salad. Salad. True story. And I paused, and I kind of was like, what in

789
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:16,259
the world? The kids and Holly, like what happened? I was like, my tooth just broke.

790
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:22,219
They're like, what? Yeah, my tooth broke. No pain, thankfully. I preached that

791
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:28,379
evening with no pain, but on Monday morning I went to the dentist. Now here,

792
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:32,619
just being very transparent, here was my attitude. I don't have time for this. I

793
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:39,099
don't have money for this. This is really not a good time. I'm being transparent.

794
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:47,099
That was my attitude. My attitude was not, I wonder how God's gonna use this. I'm

795
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:53,219
just being honest with you, and if you always think that way, you're my hero.

796
00:45:53,219 --> 00:46:00,739
Honestly, I don't always think that way. I wish I did, but my thought was, I don't

797
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:06,179
have time for this, and I don't have money for this. The doctor comes in, does

798
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:11,379
his examination. He says, well, the good news is that we can save the tooth. The

799
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:16,579
bad news is that we're gonna have to have a root canal and a crown. My first

800
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,059
question was, not that's great that we can save the tooth. My first question was,

801
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:26,099
how much is that gonna cost? He said, well, you're a preacher, aren't you? He said,

802
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,219
I'll charge you for the crown, but I'll do the root canal as a professional

803
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:35,819
courtesy. That's what he said. He left the room to go take care of another patient

804
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:41,339
and to have the assistant get me prepared for the procedure, and I had

805
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:45,659
seen this assistant a number of times over the last, you know, the couple of

806
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:51,979
years before that on just routine visits. And she comes in and she says,

807
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:58,819
Mr. Mann, I know why you broke your tooth yesterday. I hope you could inform me.

808
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:05,699
That was my attitude. How do you know why I broke my tooth? And I'll never forget

809
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:14,859
what she said to me. She said, God sent you here. She said, I knew you were a

810
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:20,979
pastor. You'd been here before. She said, I've not been living for God. In fact,

811
00:47:20,979 --> 00:47:28,579
I've been far away from God, and God's been dealing with me, and God sent you

812
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:37,099
here. And at that moment, I said, sorry, God. If you want to break my tooth in

813
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:42,899
order to put me in that place, that's a... and he allowed it to break with no

814
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:49,659
pain. Honestly, that was good. But what I'm saying is that we serve a God who is

815
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:55,499
able to do amazing things. And I had the opportunity to speak to that lady. Can I

816
00:47:55,499 --> 00:48:00,219
tell you, I would not have just shown up to the dentist that day if I didn't have

817
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:06,579
a broken tooth. Why else would I go to the dentist? I'm not just gonna go show

818
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:11,459
up at the dentist tomorrow. It's not my plan, right? You go to the dentist because

819
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:18,699
you have a problem, or it's your routine checkup. But I went on that day because

820
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:22,499
God allowed something to happen that I looked at as being a difficulty, you know,

821
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:27,979
why do I have to deal with this? That woman, that hygienist, she said, I

822
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:33,099
know why you're here. God sent you here. That was... those were her... those were not

823
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:45,299
my words. Can I tell you this evening that I wish that I would always, every

824
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:52,459
time I face a difficulty in a trial, that I would have a perspective of, God, I know

825
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:55,899
you allowed this for a purpose. Who is it that you're gonna allow me to have an

826
00:48:56,379 --> 00:49:04,139
influence, an opportunity? I'm not there yet. God's still working in our lives. I

827
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:09,299
try to have that perspective as I spend more and more time in His Word, and He

828
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:18,059
influences me and changes me than I did seven years ago. I think about that more

829
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,379
today than I did then. Why? Because I've learned more about God, and I've

830
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:27,019
understood God's master plan a little bit better. I don't see things from His

831
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:33,099
perspective, and neither do you. We only see what He allows us to see. But the

832
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:37,499
reality is that our God has a plan, and our God is able, and if we truly are in a

833
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:41,859
place where we say, my life, Lord, is yours to control, as the songwriter said,

834
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:46,099
if we truly are gonna say, I surrender all, if we truly are gonna say, I am

835
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:51,019
crucified with Christ, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain, then we're

836
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:57,059
saying to God, do with me what needs to be done in order to accomplish your

837
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,699
purpose and your plan, whatever that is. Often we speak about

838
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:06,979
those that are in the armed forces that would sign a blank check up to and

839
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:13,579
including death when they serve our country. You know, as a child of God, have

840
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:20,059
we really surrendered all? Have we really said to God, God use me however you see

841
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:25,939
fit, whatever you need to do to accomplish your purpose. God has a

842
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:33,019
purpose and a plan. Think it not strange. Amen? God's working. It's a lot easier to

843
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:37,819
see it afterwards than it is in the midst of it. Amen? It was easier for me

844
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:41,979
on Monday afternoon to see why I broke my tooth on Sunday than it was for me on

845
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:50,579
Sunday. It just was. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. I

846
00:50:50,579 --> 00:51:04,179
pray that somehow this evening you'd help one many amongst us. No doubt with

847
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:11,219
a group this size there are difficulties and trials that we're enduring. God, I

848
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,939
pray that you'd help us to have a biblical perspective, help us to

849
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:18,219
understand you have a purpose, help us to truly come to that place where we'd

850
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:23,979
say we are crucified with Christ, that we truly surrender all, that our lives, Lord,

851
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:32,979
are yours to control. I pray that you'd use us, you'd help us to respond properly

852
00:51:32,979 --> 00:51:42,299
to the trials. We'd rejoice greatly. Would you move in our midst that decisions

853
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,379
would be made that would please thee. We'll thank you for all that you'll do

854
00:51:45,379 --> 00:51:49,779
for us in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
