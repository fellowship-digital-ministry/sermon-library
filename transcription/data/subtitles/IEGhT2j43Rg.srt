1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now for this calendar year, last week was the last Sunday of the first quarter, so today

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,079
the first Sunday of the second quarter, and we're making way through the book of 2 Corinthians.

3
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:15,640
Our theme for this year, as you see on the banners, God's grace is sufficient.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Aren't you thankful for the grace of God?

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,840
And what a blessing to know that God's grace is sufficient.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,920
In the present tense, when you need God's grace, it is sufficient.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
We have that promise.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,080
Of course, as we've gone through the book of 2 Corinthians, we've made progress now

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,360
in the fifth chapter.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,020
We've been in this chapter for several weeks.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,000
We find that starting the chapter, the apostle Paul is rejoicing with regard to the certainty

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,720
of heaven, having confidence that knowing to be absent from the body is to be present

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,319
with the Lord, and sharing with the church in Corinth that reality and that excitement,

14
00:00:53,319 --> 00:01:00,400
but then also the desire that Paul had to labor, to strive, to live a life that was

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,360
pleasing in the sight of God, knowing that he would one day stand before the Lord Jesus

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Christ.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,779
The reality is that every human being will stand before Christ one day.

18
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:17,519
There are two judgments that God speaks of in His Word.

19
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,319
One, for those that have placed their faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that

20
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,839
is the bema seat of Christ, the judgment seat of Christ, and that's what Paul references

21
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:29,440
here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,519
We dealt with it a couple of weeks ago.

23
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,040
And then we find that there's the great white throne judgment that is referenced in Revelation

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,400
chapter number 20, I am thankful because I've been saved by the blood of Christ, not by

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,739
any works that I could do.

26
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,739
It's a gift.

27
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,040
It's the gift of God, which is eternal life.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,260
It's not temporary life.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,919
It's not probationary life.

30
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,879
It is eternal life, and He saved my soul.

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,279
I was undeserving, but because of His grace and because of His love, He saved me, and

32
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:03,660
I will not stand at the great white throne judgment as a subject of that judgment.

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,040
We find that those that would stand at the great white throne judgment are those that

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,399
have never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

35
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:16,139
The book of Philippians tells us that every tongue will confess, that every knee will

36
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,339
bow that Jesus Christ is Lord, and I've often said about that passage of Scripture that

37
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:27,380
it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,220
Because every tongue is gonna confess, and every knee is going to bow, it's not a matter

39
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,259
of if, it's a matter of when, and when makes all the difference.

40
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,979
Because if you confess that Jesus is Lord this side of eternity, you will spend eternity

41
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,339
with Christ as your Lord and Savior, but if you do not confess Christ as your personal

42
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:52,220
Lord and Savior on this side of eternity, you will spend forever separated from God

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,940
in a place called the Lake of Fire.

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,039
Last week we talked about who are we living for?

45
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,539
Because of all that He's done for us, who am I living for?

46
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,820
The Apostle Paul begins to evaluate his life, and he talks about the love of Christ that

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,179
constraineth us, and just understanding His love for us, and His sacrifice for us, and

48
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:17,139
what He did on the cross of Calvary, His, of course, death, burial, and resurrection.

49
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,279
And Paul says that we should not live for ourselves, but that we should live for Him.

50
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:26,660
And I talked about the struggle, I talked about the conflict that each of us have on

51
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,899
a day-by-day basis, and maybe as you went through this past week, day-by-day you had

52
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,740
that struggle of who am I living for?

53
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,220
Why am I doing the things that I'm doing?

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,139
Am I living for myself, for pleasure, for whatever it might be that's temporal, or am

55
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,020
I living for Jesus?

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,899
We then come to the verse of Scripture that's our text for this morning, 2 Corinthians 5

57
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,940
and verse number 17, and we're gonna analyze this familiar verse of Scripture.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,580
I believe this morning that if we were to go around the room that many of us this morning

59
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,940
could probably recite 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 17, at some point many of us

60
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,619
have committed this verse of Scripture to memory.

61
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:16,299
The Bible says, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

62
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:22,579
Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

63
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,799
What a great verse of Scripture.

64
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:29,239
As we think about this verse of Scripture, we find that it summarizes, and I would say

65
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:34,760
beautifully summarizes, what happened on the day that you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,359
as your personal Savior.

67
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,920
On that day, He did a miraculous work in your life.

68
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Understand this morning that salvation is the miracle of a moment.

69
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Sanctification, on the other hand, is the process of a lifetime.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,600
We're positionally sanctified, but practically speaking, the Lord's still working on me.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,079
To make me what I ought to be, and it's that process of a lifetime.

72
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,880
But the truth of salvation, I'm not becoming saved, I am saved.

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,000
It's the new birth, it's the miracle of a moment on that day.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,200
For me personally, remember, God has no grandchildren, He only has children.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,640
You're not going to heaven because your mom and dad are going to heaven, because your

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,239
grandfather was a preacher, because of any other thing.

77
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:24,000
No, it's a personal relationship that you have with the Lord Jesus Christ, and for me

78
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:31,079
it was on August 31st, 1997, as a 17-year-old senior in high school, I recognized that I

79
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,279
was lost, that I was a sinner.

80
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,760
It didn't take a lot for me to recognize I'm a sinner.

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,000
In fact, many people that I talk to today, if I ask them, hey, have you ever sinned?

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,359
Yes.

83
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:47,160
I've not met many people over the years that have said, no, I'm not a sinner.

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,559
They acknowledge that they're a sinner.

85
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:52,880
Now many times they'll try to put some type of level on it, well, I've never murdered

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,320
anyone, something like that, and I say, well, that's a great thing that you've not murdered

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,640
someone, but the reality is that we're all sinners, and I recognize on that day that

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,720
it was my sin that separated me from God.

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,359
The Bible says that we've all come short of the glory of God.

90
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:12,920
The Bible tells us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and I recognize

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,279
that I was a sinner, but I recognize there was a consequence for my sin, and that's death.

92
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,640
For the wages of sin is death, but it's not just physical death, it's spiritual death.

93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,359
It's separation from God for all of eternity in the lake of fire, and I recognize that

94
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:34,880
I needed a Savior, and there was only one Savior, and His name is Jesus.

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,359
And I recognized, as Jesus said in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,640
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,399
Jesus made a great declaration on that day.

98
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,640
He did not say, I am a way, He said, I am the way, and it gives to us a great amount

99
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,200
of clarity with regard to the way of salvation, that Jesus is the way.

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Peter and John, who would have heard Jesus make that declaration, are then standing and

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,040
they're being questioned in the book of Acts because of a great miracle that took place

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,880
at the gate beautiful and at the temple and all that had transpired, and Peter after spending

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
a night in prison, he stands before the religious leaders and he says this to them, there's

104
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,559
no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

105
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,359
What's he talking about being saved?

106
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,040
What's he talking about, what's this idea for whosoever shall call upon the name of

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,600
the Lord shall be saved?

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,279
See I recognize on that day, August 31st, 1997, that I was not saved, I was lost, I

109
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,920
was dead spiritually.

110
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,000
I was very alive physically, but I was dead spiritually.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,079
And Jesus was the only Savior, and Jesus offered to me a gift, you know what's interesting

112
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,079
about a gift?

113
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,239
A gift is something that you can receive or you can reject.

114
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,399
A gift is something that can only be given to you as a gift because someone else paid

115
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,200
for it, amen?

116
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,279
It wouldn't be called a gift if I had to earn it, if I had to work for it, it's called a

117
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:18,040
gift because Jesus, as He hung upon the cross of Calvary, said it is finished.

118
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,920
Paid in full literally is what the Greek word means.

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,339
We find that as Jesus made that declaration that it is finished, paid in full, that He

120
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:35,000
paid with His precious blood for my salvation.

121
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,359
Therefore He offers this gift.

122
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:44,219
John chapter 1 says, He came to His own, but His own received Him not.

123
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,119
But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.

124
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:54,400
And I had to recognize on that day in my life personally that I was either going to receive

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,239
the gift of God, which was eternal life, and He is going to be my Lord and Savior, or I

126
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:04,840
was going to reject that gift, and the reality is that on that day there was great spiritual

127
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,599
battle that took place, but thank God we sang the song, Ring the Bells of Heaven.

128
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,080
What's the purpose of that song?

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,679
Well there's rejoicing, why?

130
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,479
Because a soul was saved, a soul was converted, and on that day in my life there was rejoicing

131
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:24,679
in heaven, there's rejoicing on earth because I was born again.

132
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,400
Jesus said to Nicodemus, when Nicodemus came as a representative of all those religious

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,840
leaders and he came to Jesus by night and he made his declaration with regard to what

134
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,599
they had concluded based on seeing what they had seen at that point, and Jesus said, marvel

135
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:49,039
not that I say unto thee, singularly to Nicodemus, that ye all people must be born again.

136
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,580
And Nicodemus says, I don't understand what this thing means to be born again.

137
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,919
Can I enter into my mother's womb a second time?

138
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,200
I mean it's kind of comical to think about that passage of Scripture and what Nicodemus,

139
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
he's not understanding.

140
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,240
Understanding, but Jesus speaks about a physical birth and a spiritual birth

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
See, I was born July 15th

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
1980

143
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
But I was born again on August 31st

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,680
1997 I titled the message this morning

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Transformation because on that day for me personally and I think that most of us here this morning could stand and give a similar

146
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Testimony as to the day that you got saved

147
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
It was a miracle

148
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,160
Work that God did in me. He quickened me. He made me alive

149
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,920
Now he's been working on me since that day so that I would be conformed to the image of his dear son

150
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,340
So that I would be like Christ, but the reality is that on that day. He saved me. He changed my life

151
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,240
It was radical

152
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,200
What happened on that day see this morning we think about the gospel the gospel has the power to save

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,680
Do you believe that this morning? I believe the gospel has the power to say. What is the gospel?

154
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,320
Well, very simply from 1st Corinthians 15. It's the death barrel and resurrection

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,120
That's the gospel the good news of Jesus Christ. We go bearing good news

156
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,240
Are there people that don't want it you bet there are I had encounters yesterday. So man, that guy is just grumpy

157
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,880
I just said good morning. How are you? I don't want it and I'm like man

158
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,120
You don't even know what I'm offering right like come on. I

159
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
Get it I understand not everyone wants it, but man the gospel has the power to save

160
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
For I am NOT ashamed of the gospel of Christ

161
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,920
For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also the Greek

162
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,520
Oh praise the Lord for the power. He is able Hebrew 7 chapter chapter 7 verse 25

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,240
He is able to save them to the uttermost that come to God

164
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,520
Listen, he the gospel is powerful. It can save a life

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,760
It can save a sinner, but I want you to understand that I believe in a gospel that transforms an individual as well

166
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Listen, we're not talking about Reformation

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,480
We're not talking about trying to clean ourselves up

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,240
We're not talking about trying to do better and I'm gonna it's not by mine own righteousness

169
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
Here's what Isaiah says. All of our good works are as filthy rags

170
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,580
It's not by works of righteousness, which we have done but according to his mercy that he had saved us for by grace

171
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,100
We have saved through faith and that not of yourselves

172
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
It is the gift of God not of works

173
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,780
lest any man should boast in fact in the book of Romans as Paul as Paul is speaking there and

174
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,740
Giving the illustration in the example going back to history of Abraham

175
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,820
He talks about Abraham being justified not by works, but by faith. He says if it's by works, then it's a debt

176
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
It's something that Abraham was owed

177
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
God doesn't know us anything

178
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,780
But in his great love

179
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
He wanted to reconcile us

180
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,460
to redeem us

181
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,700
Listen this morning if you're not here if you're here this morning and you're not saved you've never trusted Christ as your Savior

182
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,020
Can I tell you this morning?

183
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,220
Today is the day of salvation. In fact in the very next chapter in

184
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,780
2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 the Bible says for he has saith I have heard thee in a time accepted in the day

185
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:20,020
Of salvation have I suckered thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of

186
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,260
Salvation

187
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,340
If you're not saved this morning if you do not have 100% assurance that heaven is your home today

188
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,980
Is the day of your salvation would you trust Christ today?

189
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,900
But as we examine this verse of Scripture, I want you to consider with me three thoughts number one the experience of Paul

190
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,060
The experience of Paul as Paul is writing these words as he's speaking about therefore if any man be in Christ

191
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,900
He is a new creature

192
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,060
He says that that behold all he says all old things are passed away

193
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,260
Behold all things are become new

194
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,260
begin to think about the Apostle Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God penning these words and I

195
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:07,060
Believe that as Paul was writing these very words that that his mind would rush back to the day in

196
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,020
Which he trusts that Christ is his personal Savior

197
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,820
Just as I've had the opportunity to recount for you my experience of trusting Christ as my Savior

198
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,380
We find that the Apostle Paul he experienced the trance

199
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,140
Transformation in his life. He experienced the power of the gospel

200
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,540
personally not to just simply reform but to transform

201
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,180
We find that in Paul's life

202
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,700
It's Acts chapter number nine turn back if you will and I want you to look at Paul in Acts chapter number nine

203
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,980
And as we look at this chapter

204
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,900
we really could spend the entirety in Acts 9 this morning and just looking at this experience of Paul and what a great experience it

205
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,260
Is and we find that it rehearses for us. It gives us the the account of Paul

206
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,700
Traveling on the road to Damascus. He's going according to verses 1 & 2 his name at this point is Saul

207
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,740
But notice what the Bible says in Acts 9 in verse number 1 and Saul

208
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,940
Yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord

209
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,660
Went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues

210
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:23,820
But if he found any notice this phrase of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound

211
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,220
Unto Jerusalem and we find that Saul at this point

212
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,100
He was dealing with all that had transpired at the end of chapter 7

213
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,740
We find that a man by the name of Stephen the first martyr of the local church or of the church if you will

214
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,660
Was martyred there and he stoned and the Bible tells us that they laid

215
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:51,380
The garments his garments at the feet of Saul and we find that Saul I believe he was dealing with great

216
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,340
level of

217
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
conviction why

218
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
because he saw Stephen as

219
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,060
It were his countenance as an angel

220
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
He heard Stephen utter similar words to what Jesus had uttered when he was on the cross

221
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,260
Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do

222
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,700
We find that Stephen uttered similar words

223
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,660
We find that that Saul was under great conviction and what do we do when we're under conviction?

224
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,300
well, we either submit or we really get angry about it and Saul is angry and I mean his

225
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
level of

226
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,460
Attacking the church and all that was going on with the persecution reaches

227
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,020
its highest point at the start of Acts chapter number 9

228
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,980
And we find that he's on the way to Damascus then verse number 4

229
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,700
The Bible says that he was journeying in verse 3 in verse 4

230
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,660
He had heard this this light this let me read verse 3 and as he journeyed

231
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,620
he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and

232
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,140
He saw fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul

233
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,100
Why persecute us thou me?

234
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,020
And he saw said who art thou Lord?

235
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,100
The Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute est

236
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,540
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks that conviction that he was dealing with

237
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,180
That that imagery that is used here of kicking against the pricks and how they would use them to move

238
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,100
Livestock and all that they would do and he says listen God saying you're under great conviction

239
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,580
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks in verse number 6

240
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,940
The the Bible says that he was trembling and astonished and said Lord

241
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,660
What wilt thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee

242
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,940
What thou must do in this passage of Scripture we find that Paul

243
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,660
Experienced what we're speaking of in 2nd Corinthians 5 in verse number 17. He was radically changed

244
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,980
He was not the same man. He no longer was the same he had experienced

245
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,980
the power of the gospel

246
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,500
He'd experienced not only now was he gonna go to heaven when he died because he had accepted the Lord as a Savior

247
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,060
But we find that his life would forever be changed

248
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,420
We find that as the Apostle Paul as we refer to him as here

249
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,860
he's he's blinded and of course we understand as you go through the passage that there was a

250
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:21,220
Disciple by the name of Ananias that God directed to go and speak to to him to Saul and he comes and he says brother

251
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Saul what a great

252
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
What a great reference

253
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,220
To now this man who had been known as the persecutor that Ananias is now saying brother Saul

254
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,380
And I want you to notice in verse number 20 of Acts chapter number 9

255
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,380
I'll read verse 19 with it

256
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,100
The Bible says in verse 19 of Acts 9 and when he'd received me

257
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:50,619
He was strengthened then with Saul certain days with the disciples, which were at Damascus and notice verse 20 and straightway

258
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,100
He preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God

259
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:04,220
What a transformation. I mean what an experience that Paul had I understand his name is still Saul here in Acts 9

260
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,619
but I want you to see in his life if you were to read verse 1 and verse 2 and you were to skip verse 3

261
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,580
Through verse 18 and just pick it up in verse 19. It would make zero sense

262
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,179
Because the purpose of him going to the synagogue was so that he could arrest people and bind them and take them to Jerusalem

263
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,820
He was persecuting but in verse number 20

264
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:34,100
He's now preaching in the synagogue that Jesus is the Christ the Messiah the promised one God in flesh

265
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:41,559
If you don't read the middle verses you have no idea what happened to this guy

266
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,040
but when you read the middle verses you find out he met Jesus and

267
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,559
Jesus changed his life

268
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,799
He experienced in his life what he's writing about to the church in Corinth

269
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,160
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature and I think

270
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,760
Think about Paul thinking back to his life before he was a Christian.

271
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,160
I wonder this morning, I think about my life.

272
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,920
I was 17 when I got saved by the grace of God, and I can remember prior to being 17

273
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,320
years old, I can remember what my goals and ambitions and desires were.

274
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,120
I can remember how God changed me.

275
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,840
The power of the gospel.

276
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Praise the Lord.

277
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,960
That's what Paul experienced.

278
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Notice in the book of Galatians, if you will, and Paul is writing, Galatians chapter 1,

279
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,600
he's writing back to the churches in the region of Galatia.

280
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,080
And as he's writing back, and it's an interesting thing because this is the first region that

281
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,040
Paul went to on that first missionary journey.

282
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,600
God saved him, and God called him, and then God used him, and Paul ends up in the region

283
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,840
of Galatia.

284
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
He's preaching.

285
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,920
There are churches, four of them, that are, as he goes into these four cities in the region

286
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,880
of Galatia, these churches that are established, and now he's writing back to them.

287
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,400
And I want you to notice the end of chapter 1, the Bible says this, in verse number 23,

288
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,040
verse 22, it says, and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ.

289
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,920
Paul was unknown to them, but notice in verse 23, but they had heard only, listen to what

290
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:26,520
they heard, that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once

291
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,800
he destroyed, and they glorified God in me.

292
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,540
You know what they heard?

293
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,920
They heard that that man got saved.

294
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,600
And he once persecuted, but now he's preaching.

295
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,160
Praise the Lord.

296
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,920
And because of what they heard, the Bible says they glorified God in me.

297
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,320
You know what they were doing?

298
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,520
They were thanking God for the power of the gospel.

299
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,440
They were thanking God for the conversion of this individual.

300
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,520
We begin to think about in our own lives those that God might allow us the opportunity to

301
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,560
see saved and to see how their lives have been changed, and yes, their eternal destination

302
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,200
is changed in a moment, but their lives are radically changed by the gospel.

303
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,920
We believe a gospel that saves a sinner, but we believe a gospel that transforms a man.

304
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,200
This morning as we look at the text, we note the experience of Paul, but back in 2 Corinthians

305
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,040
chapter number 5, I want you to notice number 2, the expectation of Paul.

306
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,800
I believe that Paul had an expectation.

307
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,360
He had experienced personally, but I believe that he had an expectation.

308
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,040
You know what that expectation was?

309
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,540
He expected that those that got saved were radically different.

310
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,440
He expected that those that trust at Christ as their personal Savior had that same transformation

311
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
that he had experienced.

312
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,480
He believed, he expected that these individuals, because he says, therefore, if any man, Paul's

313
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,740
not just saying that this was my experience because I was something special, because I

314
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,000
received some special grace.

315
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,920
No, the gospel that saved me is the same gospel that saves you, and the gospel that transformed

316
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,000
me is the gospel that I expect to transform you.

317
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
Does that make sense?

318
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,520
We find that as the Apostle Paul is writing this church in Corinth, we know some things

319
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
about the church in Corinth.

320
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,200
They're a church that's carnal.

321
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,920
They're a church that's divided.

322
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,400
They're a church that they're dealing with some of this, you know, yes, we're going to

323
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,520
keep some of those old ways, if you will, but Paul says old things are passed away,

324
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,200
and behold, all things are become new.

325
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,600
And Paul had this expectation that the same God who transformed my life is the same God

326
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,640
that's going to transform your life.

327
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,160
You ever hear somebody say something like this?

328
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,120
They see somebody that got saved, and they say, now, they really got saved.

329
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,160
And some of the old preachers would kind of talk that way.

330
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,800
They'd get real deep in their voice, and they kind of lean over the pulpit and say, man,

331
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
they got saved.

332
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,760
Listen, what were they trying to communicate by saying that?

333
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
Well, man, look at their life.

334
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Look at what...

335
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,200
But I want you to understand that every single person that gets saved ought to have that

336
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,480
same level of experience that they got saved.

337
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Why?

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,960
Because I'm a new creature.

339
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,120
I'm a new creature.

340
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,320
I have a new identity.

341
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,400
After that day in my life on August 31st, 1997, I was no longer my own.

342
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I was bought with a price.

343
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
By the way, I was never really my own.

344
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I was a child of the devil, according to John chapter number eight.

345
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Now, I didn't think I was.

346
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,440
I didn't know what that meant.

347
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,480
It's not like I worshiped the devil, but I was lost.

348
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,560
And the reality is that as we look at this truth this morning that Paul had this expectation,

349
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,560
because I had a new identity, I think about our identity in Christ, I think about us as

350
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
individuals.

351
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
What do we say?

352
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
How do we do?

353
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Hey, I'm a Christian.

354
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,480
That's the first thing that identifies us.

355
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Why?

356
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Because I'm in Christ.

357
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm a new creature.

358
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,680
I've been radically changed.

359
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,960
And Paul had this expectation as Paul went forth and preached the gospel, as Paul went

360
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,040
to new regions, and he would use that phrase, to the regions beyond you, as Paul would go

361
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,720
into a new city as he would preach the gospel, he expected that the gospel would have an

362
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,080
impact on individuals.

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
He expected that they would not be the same.

364
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Listen, can I explain to you this morning maybe this way?

365
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,640
The truth of salvation is not just taking Jesus and adding him to your shelf.

366
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,120
No.

367
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,760
It's not salvation.

368
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,800
Salvation is not, okay, yeah, I'll just believe Jesus, that's great.

369
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Oh, you know what?

370
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm going to go to heaven when I die.

371
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
No, no, no.

372
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,480
No, no, no.

373
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
It's transformation.

374
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,520
I don't work for it.

375
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,360
There's nothing I could do to earn it.

376
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,040
But when a man is saved, he is radically different.

377
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,160
We sing the song with the young people.

378
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,200
The things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

379
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Why?

380
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,320
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

381
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
The places I used to go, I don't go there anymore.

382
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,840
I mean, you can go on different verse after different verse after different verse that

383
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,200
we sing with the kids in Sunday school and junior church and vacation Bible school, and

384
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,560
the reality is we try to teach those little kids and the reality is that we need to be

385
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,680
reminded this morning that I am a new creature.

386
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,200
I shouldn't think the same way.

387
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may

388
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,800
prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

389
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,240
Listen, I'm a new creature.

390
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,120
I'm not the same.

391
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,000
If you've ever read our website bio, I put on there that God turned my life right side

392
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,320
up.

393
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,280
It was radical.

394
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,880
All of a sudden as a senior in high school, having various plans and ideas of what I would

395
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,560
do with my life, all of a sudden it was more about what God wanted with my life than what

396
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
I wanted with my life.

397
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Why?

398
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,840
Because there's a radical change.

399
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,920
And I don't know this morning what your experience was, but I understand the expectation that

400
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Paul has.

401
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,280
He expected that those that were born again, those that were in Christ were transformed

402
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,280
by the power of the gospel, that they were new creatures, that those old things were

403
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,320
passed away, that all things are become new.

404
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,240
Does it mean that we become perfect at the day of salvation?

405
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,240
No, not even close, because we understand that Ephesians and Colossians, both of those

406
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,860
letters deal with that process of what we would call in the book of Galatians of walking

407
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,040
in the Spirit.

408
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,660
And what do they explain in Ephesians and in Colossians?

409
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,460
There's some things that we're to put off, and there's some things we're to put on.

410
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,080
And we're to walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

411
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,880
It doesn't mean that my flesh or your flesh doesn't have those desires anymore.

412
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,520
It simply means that there's a greater one that lives within us, the Holy Spirit of God

413
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,120
now indwells me.

414
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,200
And we find that there's this expectation that Paul has.

415
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,920
And I wonder this morning, as we look at this verse, and I wonder about these folks in Corinth

416
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,240
that as they receive this, and they begin to evaluate their own lives, because no doubt

417
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,800
the Apostle Paul, when he's penning the words, would be reminded of his own personal experience.

418
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,800
But he expected that this would be the case for those that have been saved.

419
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,680
I don't know about you, but for me, the Holy Spirit, and I know for everyone that's truly

420
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,920
born again, the Bible tells us the Holy Spirit lives within us.

421
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Amen?

422
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,000
Is that what the Bible teaches us?

423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
At the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance.

424
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,740
We are sealed in the day of redemption with the Holy Spirit.

425
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,420
So the Holy Spirit of God lives within me.

426
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,260
On that day that I got saved, He indwelled me.

427
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,500
And you know what the Holy Spirit does?

428
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,740
Man, He convicts us.

429
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,220
Yes, He comforts us as well, but the Holy Spirit of God, He convicts us.

430
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,940
And there were things that maybe I didn't even know a Bible verse yet.

431
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,460
I had not heard the preaching yet.

432
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,780
I was a babe in Christ.

433
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,820
I desired to grow, but the Holy Spirit of God would convict me about certain things.

434
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,460
You shouldn't be doing these things anymore.

435
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Why?

436
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Because you're a Christian.

437
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
You're saved.

438
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,540
You're a new creature.

439
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,740
And it's amazing the work of the Holy Spirit, but here's the problem.

440
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,540
For some, as we grow in our faith, as we kind of, I hate to even use the expression, but

441
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:40,460
I think it's valid, there are times in which sometimes we get over our salvation.

442
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,040
We ought never get over our salvation.

443
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,460
We ought never get over the fact that God saved us.

444
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,100
But I fear for some, it's as if they just kind of get over it.

445
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,900
And they've learned how to quench and to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

446
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,660
They no longer are hearing the still small voice.

447
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,660
See, Paul had this expectation. He writes about it in the book of Philemon.

448
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,660
Turn over, if you will, quickly. It's only one chapter in the book of Philemon,

449
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,660
but we find in the book of Philemon the Apostle Paul is writing about an individual.

450
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,660
The individual that he's writing about is a man by the name of Onesimus.

451
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Onesimus has this testimony as you read in the book of Philemon, and it's only 25 verses.

452
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,660
It's a short book, just one chapter.

453
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:34,660
And Paul is writing to Philemon, and specifically about Onesimus.

454
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,660
And I want you to notice what Paul says.

455
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Beginning in verse number 10, the Bible says this,

456
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,660
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus.

457
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,660
Now, was this guy Onesimus Paul's biological son? No.

458
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Paul refers to Timothy as his son in the faith. He refers to Titus as his son in the faith.

459
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,660
And here he refers to Onesimus as my son.

460
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,660
Was he referring to someone that God allowed him, Paul, to lead to Christ that was born again?

461
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,660
And we find that Paul is writing to Philemon.

462
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,660
See, Philemon, Onesimus had been a slave, and Onesimus had fled.

463
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,660
Philemon was his master.

464
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Paul writes to Philemon, and he says, I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,

465
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,660
notice, whom I have begotten in my bonds.

466
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Paul was in prison, but he was still preaching the gospel.

467
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Why? Because he knew the power of the gospel.

468
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
He knew he'd have been saved by the grace of God,

469
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,660
and he knew he'd have been given to him the ministry of reconciliation.

470
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,660
And he's preaching the gospel, and he says that this man, Onesimus, he got saved while I was in bonds.

471
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,660
And notice in verse number 11, which, notice these words,

472
00:31:50,660 --> 00:32:00,660
in time past was to thee, Philemon, unprofitable,

473
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:07,660
but now profitable to thee, Philemon, and to me, Paul.

474
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Now, notice these two phrases.

475
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
I highlighted them as I read verse number 11.

476
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
I have them underlined in my Bible.

477
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:21,660
But notice the contrast between in time past, but now.

478
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,660
In time past, he's unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

479
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,660
What happened? Did he go to school? Did he get an education?

480
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,660
No, what happened was he got saved by the grace of God.

481
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,660
He'd been born again. He was a new creature.

482
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,660
And Paul says, this guy, Onesimus, my son, Onesimus, he was begotten.

483
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:47,660
He was born again while I was in bonds, and he was to thee unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

484
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Why? Because he's been saved.

485
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,660
He's not the same guy anymore.

486
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,660
He's been transformed. Amen?

487
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,660
So Paul has an experience. Paul has an expectation.

488
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,660
This morning, as we look at this verse of Scripture, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17,

489
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,660
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

490
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,660
All things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new.

491
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Often as I share the gospel with individuals, I will say something to them like this when I come to Romans 10 and verse 13.

492
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,660
For whosoever, and I'll say this, Ron, I'll say you can put your name right there.

493
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,660
For whosoever, that means anyone.

494
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
So maybe we can read the verse this way.

495
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,660
For if Tim shall call upon the name of the Lord, Tim shall be saved.

496
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Because Tim is a whosoever. Amen?

497
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,660
And I'm a whosoever. And you're a whosoever.

498
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:55,660
And for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Hallelujah.

499
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,660
As we wrap up the message this morning, we see the experience of Paul.

500
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
We see the expectation of Paul.

501
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Number three, I want you to consider this thought, the evidence in my life.

502
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
The evidence in my life.

503
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I want you to put your name there where it says, if any man be in Christ.

504
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
The same way we would do with Romans 10 and verse 13.

505
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,660
We're trying to lead somebody to Christ and tell them that Christ will save them.

506
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,660
He is able. If any man be in Christ.

507
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,660
And put your name right there where it says any man.

508
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,660
And if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

509
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,660
if you were that whosoever in Romans 10, 13 that recognized,

510
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
I can't get to heaven on my own.

511
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,660
I recognize that Jesus is the only way.

512
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,660
Maybe you're here this morning and you've been trying to live some type of religious life.

513
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,660
You've been like Nicodemus. He was a ruler of the Jews.

514
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
He was religious.

515
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,660
But religion never saved a man.

516
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,660
You say, but I'm seeking to keep the law.

517
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,660
I had a conversation with someone about two months ago.

518
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,660
They said, well, you know, we're just working to keep the law.

519
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,660
In the very moment that they were telling me they were working to keep the law,

520
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,660
you know what they were doing? Breaking the law.

521
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,660
They didn't even know it.

522
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
But they were breaking the law.

523
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,660
When they were telling me that they're seeking to keep the law.

524
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You know what the law does? It condemns.

525
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
The law can't save you.

526
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,660
You know what the law does? It points you to the only one that can.

527
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Jesus Christ.

528
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,660
And this morning, if you're not saved,

529
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,660
you need to insert your name in that Romans 10, 13.

530
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,660
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

531
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Religion won't save you.

532
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Good works won't save you.

533
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
They can't.

534
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
In fact, in the same book, in the book of Galatians, Paul said it this way.

535
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,660
If righteousness were obtained by the law, then Christ is dead and vain.

536
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Listen, my Jesus did not die in vain.

537
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,660
He died because it was the only way for humanity to be saved.

538
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
There's no other way.

539
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
No other way.

540
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Jesus had to go to that cross.

541
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
And I'm glad he did.

542
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
He went willingly. He said it this way.

543
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,660
I lay down my life for the sheep.

544
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
And I taketh it up again.

545
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,660
Hallelujah, we serve a risen Savior.

546
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,660
But this morning, if you've been saved,

547
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
and you've already trusted Christ as your Savior,

548
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
I want you to think about the evidence in your life from Romans,

549
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
or from 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

550
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,660
And I want you to put your name there.

551
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Therefore, if Chris, that's my name,

552
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,660
because it says if any man, any individual,

553
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,660
if Chris be in Christ, if I've been saved,

554
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,660
he is a new creature.

555
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Old things are passed away.

556
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
Behold, all things are become new.

557
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,660
What's the evidence of salvation in my life?

558
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,660
What's the evidence of salvation in your life?

559
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,660
See, because the gospel not only saves a man,

560
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,660
but the gospel transforms a man.

561
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,660
And we find that Paul is giving his experience.

562
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,660
He's sharing what his expectation is.

563
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,660
But then for the recipients of this verse of Scripture,

564
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,660
for us today, as we would evaluate or examine,

565
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,660
what's the evidence point to?

566
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,660
What does the evidence point to?

567
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,660
Because if you're in Christ, if you're saved this morning,

568
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
you're a new creature.

569
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
That's what the Bible says.

570
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,660
It's not just adding another little G-O-D, God,

571
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:53,660
to your list of, no, Jesus Christ is the only Savior.

572
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,660
How has it changed our lives, the gospel?

573
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,660
What transformation has taken place in your life, in my life?

574
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Has it changed our behavior?

575
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,660
The things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

576
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Has it changed our thoughts?

577
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Has it changed our attitude?

578
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
Has it changed our perspective?

579
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Has it changed our speech?

580
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Has it changed my pursuits in life?

581
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Has it changed...

582
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Listen, I understand that it's on the inside,

583
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,660
but what's on the inside comes out on the outside.

584
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Amen?

585
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,660
Has it changed what I value?

586
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Has it changed how I live my life?

587
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Listen, this morning, before I was ever a pastor,

588
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,660
I've been pastor now for almost 14 years here at this church,

589
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
and I thank God for it.

590
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,660
But I've been saved for a lot longer than 14 years.

591
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,660
I've been pastoring here for 14 years, but you know what?

592
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
From the time I got saved, you know what?

593
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,660
I was in church all the time after I got saved.

594
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Before I got saved, Ron, I never went to church.

595
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
I didn't want to go to church.

596
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Why?

597
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
There was nothing for me there.

598
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,660
I was lost.

599
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I was dead.

600
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,660
There was no desire in me to be in church as a lost person.

601
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,660
But after I got saved, man, Sunday school, Sunday morning,

602
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Sunday night, Wednesday night, revival meetings, missions conference,

603
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,660
bring it on.

604
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Amen?

605
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,660
And so much the more, as you see the day approaching,

606
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,660
I love to be with the people of God.

607
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
But that's not just because I'm a pastor.

608
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
It's because I'm a Christian.

609
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,660
Because long before I ever became a pastor, you know what I did?

610
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
I went to church.

611
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Because we're the saints of God gathered together.

612
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,660
The church is a body of believers.

613
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Listen, what do I value in life?

614
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,660
How do I spend my time?

615
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
How do I spend my treasure?

616
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
How do I use my talents?

617
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,660
It's all changed because I've been saved and I'm a new creature.

618
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,660
And I wonder this morning, have you had that same experience that Paul had?

619
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Can you evaluate your life?

620
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
Can you see evidence?

621
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:08,060
in your life of this change. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. I can look

622
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:18,740
at my life pre-salvation and post-salvation and I can see a radical change. I'm not perfect.

623
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,860
God's still working on me. And by the way, before you get too holy, you're not perfect

624
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:33,700
either. Amen? Right? Can I get an amen? Come on. None of us are. But one day, this mortal

625
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:41,820
shall put on immortality. This corruption shall put on incorruption. Amen? That's going

626
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:47,580
to be a radical change when I get to heaven. And what a day that will be. It's on the front

627
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:54,500
of our bulletin this week. What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. But I'm

628
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:02,700
asking you this morning, how's your life? Has it been radically changed because of the

629
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,020
gospel? You're just kind of like, you know what? I'm saved. I'm going to heaven. I'm

630
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:14,060
still living for myself. I'm still doing my own thing. I still… No, listen. The gospel

631
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:23,260
transforms an individual. I'm not trying to talk anybody out of being saved this morning.

632
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:30,060
But if I could talk you out of being saved, you better examine yourself. I'm not kept

633
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:38,540
by my works. I'm kept by God. I'm not kept by my works. But according to Ephesians 2,

634
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:45,220
8, 9, and then 10, we are His workmanship in Christ Jesus and we are ordained to good

635
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:51,960
works. Titus talks about, many times, about good works. These works don't save me. These

636
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,220
works don't keep me saved. But they are a result of this transformation that's in Christ.

637
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:08,620
Paul says, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed

638
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:16,900
away. Behold, all things are become new. Have you experienced the transformation of the

639
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,820
gospel? I hope this morning that you can look at your life the same way I could look at

640
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,900
my life, the same way Paul could look at his life. And so, you know what? Prior to that

641
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:35,260
day that I was traveling to Damascus with those letters giving me the ability to take

642
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:43,380
captive those that were Christians, to imprison them, prior to that day and after that day,

643
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:52,060
my life was radically different because Jesus changed my life. If you're not saved this

644
00:42:52,060 --> 00:43:01,140
morning, today is the day of salvation. He wants to save you. And after He saves us,

645
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:09,020
He wants us to be conformed to the image of His dear Son. That we be like Jesus. Amen?

646
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:16,260
Romans 8, verse 29, it speaks about that. That we are to be like Christ. It's a great

647
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:22,140
work that God does in our lives. This morning, evaluate your life. Has there been a great

648
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:28,980
change in my life? Could people see it? You meet somebody that you knew prior to being

649
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:36,220
saved and then you run into them now and they're like, whoa, what happened to you? I got saved.

650
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:43,420
God changed my life. I'm a new creature. Praise the Lord. Let's pray together. Father, we

651
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:49,420
love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for the power of the Gospel. Thank

652
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:57,140
You for saving my soul. Thank You for changing my life. Thank You for the testimony of the

653
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:03,340
Apostle Paul. Lord, I pray that You would help us this morning. If there's one that's

654
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,860
not saved, God, I pray they'd come to this old-fashioned altar. We'd have an opportunity

655
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,980
to share the Gospel with them. They'd be saved by the grace of God. For every child of God

656
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:21,720
in this building today, Lord, I pray that we'd evaluate our lives. I pray that not one

657
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,820
of us have gotten over our salvation, but maybe it'd be true of someone here. They're

658
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,620
just kind of going through the motions, so to speak. God, I pray that You'd help us to

659
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:41,260
allow You to have Your will in way, that those changes would be evidenced in our lives, proofs

660
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:47,820
of salvation, proofs of being a new creature. In this time of invitation, would You have

661
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,700
Your will in way? We give You the glory for all that You'll do. For it's in Christ's name

662
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,740
we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
