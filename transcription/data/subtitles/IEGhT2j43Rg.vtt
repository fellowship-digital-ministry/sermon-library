00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now for this calendar year, last week was the last Sunday of the first quarter, so today

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.079
the first Sunday of the second quarter, and we're making way through the book of 2 Corinthians.

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.640
Our theme for this year, as you see on the banners, God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.680
Aren't you thankful for the grace of God?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.840
And what a blessing to know that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.920
In the present tense, when you need God's grace, it is sufficient.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920
We have that promise.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.080
Of course, as we've gone through the book of 2 Corinthians, we've made progress now

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.360
in the fifth chapter.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.020
We've been in this chapter for several weeks.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.000
We find that starting the chapter, the apostle Paul is rejoicing with regard to the certainty

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.720
of heaven, having confidence that knowing to be absent from the body is to be present

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.319
with the Lord, and sharing with the church in Corinth that reality and that excitement,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:01:00.400
but then also the desire that Paul had to labor, to strive, to live a life that was

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.360
pleasing in the sight of God, knowing that he would one day stand before the Lord Jesus

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
Christ.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.779
The reality is that every human being will stand before Christ one day.

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:17.519
There are two judgments that God speaks of in His Word.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:22.319
One, for those that have placed their faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.839
is the bema seat of Christ, the judgment seat of Christ, and that's what Paul references

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:29.440
here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.519
We dealt with it a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:36.040
And then we find that there's the great white throne judgment that is referenced in Revelation

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.400
chapter number 20, I am thankful because I've been saved by the blood of Christ, not by

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.739
any works that I could do.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:44.739
It's a gift.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.040
It's the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.260
It's not temporary life.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.919
It's not probationary life.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.879
It is eternal life, and He saved my soul.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:58.279
I was undeserving, but because of His grace and because of His love, He saved me, and

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.660
I will not stand at the great white throne judgment as a subject of that judgment.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040
We find that those that would stand at the great white throne judgment are those that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.399
have never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:16.139
The book of Philippians tells us that every tongue will confess, that every knee will

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:22.339
bow that Jesus Christ is Lord, and I've often said about that passage of Scripture that

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:27.380
it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.220
Because every tongue is gonna confess, and every knee is going to bow, it's not a matter

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.259
of if, it's a matter of when, and when makes all the difference.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.979
Because if you confess that Jesus is Lord this side of eternity, you will spend eternity

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:47.339
with Christ as your Lord and Savior, but if you do not confess Christ as your personal

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:52.220
Lord and Savior on this side of eternity, you will spend forever separated from God

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.940
in a place called the Lake of Fire.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.039
Last week we talked about who are we living for?

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.539
Because of all that He's done for us, who am I living for?

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:06.820
The Apostle Paul begins to evaluate his life, and he talks about the love of Christ that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.179
constraineth us, and just understanding His love for us, and His sacrifice for us, and

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:17.139
what He did on the cross of Calvary, His, of course, death, burial, and resurrection.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.279
And Paul says that we should not live for ourselves, but that we should live for Him.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.660
And I talked about the struggle, I talked about the conflict that each of us have on

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.899
a day-by-day basis, and maybe as you went through this past week, day-by-day you had

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.740
that struggle of who am I living for?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.220
Why am I doing the things that I'm doing?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.139
Am I living for myself, for pleasure, for whatever it might be that's temporal, or am

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.020
I living for Jesus?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.899
We then come to the verse of Scripture that's our text for this morning, 2 Corinthians 5

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.940
and verse number 17, and we're gonna analyze this familiar verse of Scripture.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.580
I believe this morning that if we were to go around the room that many of us this morning

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.940
could probably recite 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 17, at some point many of us

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.619
have committed this verse of Scripture to memory.

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:16.299
The Bible says, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.579
Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:24.799
What a great verse of Scripture.

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:29.239
As we think about this verse of Scripture, we find that it summarizes, and I would say

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:34.760
beautifully summarizes, what happened on the day that you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.359
as your personal Savior.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.920
On that day, He did a miraculous work in your life.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
Understand this morning that salvation is the miracle of a moment.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.720
Sanctification, on the other hand, is the process of a lifetime.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.600
We're positionally sanctified, but practically speaking, the Lord's still working on me.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.079
To make me what I ought to be, and it's that process of a lifetime.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:03.880
But the truth of salvation, I'm not becoming saved, I am saved.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.000
It's the new birth, it's the miracle of a moment on that day.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.200
For me personally, remember, God has no grandchildren, He only has children.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.640
You're not going to heaven because your mom and dad are going to heaven, because your

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.239
grandfather was a preacher, because of any other thing.

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.000
No, it's a personal relationship that you have with the Lord Jesus Christ, and for me

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:31.079
it was on August 31st, 1997, as a 17-year-old senior in high school, I recognized that I

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.279
was lost, that I was a sinner.

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.760
It didn't take a lot for me to recognize I'm a sinner.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.000
In fact, many people that I talk to today, if I ask them, hey, have you ever sinned?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.359
Yes.

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:47.160
I've not met many people over the years that have said, no, I'm not a sinner.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.559
They acknowledge that they're a sinner.

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.880
Now many times they'll try to put some type of level on it, well, I've never murdered

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.320
anyone, something like that, and I say, well, that's a great thing that you've not murdered

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.640
someone, but the reality is that we're all sinners, and I recognize on that day that

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.720
it was my sin that separated me from God.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.359
The Bible says that we've all come short of the glory of God.

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:12.920
The Bible tells us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and I recognize

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.279
that I was a sinner, but I recognize there was a consequence for my sin, and that's death.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:23.640
For the wages of sin is death, but it's not just physical death, it's spiritual death.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.359
It's separation from God for all of eternity in the lake of fire, and I recognize that

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:34.880
I needed a Savior, and there was only one Savior, and His name is Jesus.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.359
And I recognized, as Jesus said in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.640
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.399
Jesus made a great declaration on that day.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:53.640
He did not say, I am a way, He said, I am the way, and it gives to us a great amount

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.200
of clarity with regard to the way of salvation, that Jesus is the way.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.040
Peter and John, who would have heard Jesus make that declaration, are then standing and

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.040
they're being questioned in the book of Acts because of a great miracle that took place

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.880
at the gate beautiful and at the temple and all that had transpired, and Peter after spending

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880
a night in prison, he stands before the religious leaders and he says this to them, there's

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.559
no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:27.359
What's he talking about being saved?

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:31.040
What's he talking about, what's this idea for whosoever shall call upon the name of

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.600
the Lord shall be saved?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.279
See I recognize on that day, August 31st, 1997, that I was not saved, I was lost, I

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.920
was dead spiritually.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:46.000
I was very alive physically, but I was dead spiritually.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.079
And Jesus was the only Savior, and Jesus offered to me a gift, you know what's interesting

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.079
about a gift?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:56.239
A gift is something that you can receive or you can reject.

00:07:56.239 --> 00:08:00.399
A gift is something that can only be given to you as a gift because someone else paid

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.200
for it, amen?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.279
It wouldn't be called a gift if I had to earn it, if I had to work for it, it's called a

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:18.040
gift because Jesus, as He hung upon the cross of Calvary, said it is finished.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.920
Paid in full literally is what the Greek word means.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.339
We find that as Jesus made that declaration that it is finished, paid in full, that He

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:35.000
paid with His precious blood for my salvation.

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.359
Therefore He offers this gift.

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:44.219
John chapter 1 says, He came to His own, but His own received Him not.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.119
But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:54.400
And I had to recognize on that day in my life personally that I was either going to receive

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.239
the gift of God, which was eternal life, and He is going to be my Lord and Savior, or I

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:04.840
was going to reject that gift, and the reality is that on that day there was great spiritual

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.599
battle that took place, but thank God we sang the song, Ring the Bells of Heaven.

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.080
What's the purpose of that song?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.679
Well there's rejoicing, why?

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:19.479
Because a soul was saved, a soul was converted, and on that day in my life there was rejoicing

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:24.679
in heaven, there's rejoicing on earth because I was born again.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:29.400
Jesus said to Nicodemus, when Nicodemus came as a representative of all those religious

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.840
leaders and he came to Jesus by night and he made his declaration with regard to what

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.599
they had concluded based on seeing what they had seen at that point, and Jesus said, marvel

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:49.039
not that I say unto thee, singularly to Nicodemus, that ye all people must be born again.

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:52.580
And Nicodemus says, I don't understand what this thing means to be born again.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.919
Can I enter into my mother's womb a second time?

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:59.200
I mean it's kind of comical to think about that passage of Scripture and what Nicodemus,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.080
he's not understanding.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.240
Understanding, but Jesus speaks about a physical birth and a spiritual birth

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.240
See, I was born July 15th

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
1980

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.560
But I was born again on August 31st

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.680
1997 I titled the message this morning

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.120
Transformation because on that day for me personally and I think that most of us here this morning could stand and give a similar

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.080
Testimony as to the day that you got saved

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.920
It was a miracle

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.160
Work that God did in me. He quickened me. He made me alive

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.920
Now he's been working on me since that day so that I would be conformed to the image of his dear son

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.340
So that I would be like Christ, but the reality is that on that day. He saved me. He changed my life

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.240
It was radical

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.200
What happened on that day see this morning we think about the gospel the gospel has the power to save

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.680
Do you believe that this morning? I believe the gospel has the power to say. What is the gospel?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.320
Well, very simply from 1st Corinthians 15. It's the death barrel and resurrection

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.120
That's the gospel the good news of Jesus Christ. We go bearing good news

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:18.240
Are there people that don't want it you bet there are I had encounters yesterday. So man, that guy is just grumpy

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.880
I just said good morning. How are you? I don't want it and I'm like man

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.120
You don't even know what I'm offering right like come on. I

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.760
Get it I understand not everyone wants it, but man the gospel has the power to save

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.280
For I am NOT ashamed of the gospel of Christ

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.920
For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also the Greek

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.520
Oh praise the Lord for the power. He is able Hebrew 7 chapter chapter 7 verse 25

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.240
He is able to save them to the uttermost that come to God

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.520
Listen, he the gospel is powerful. It can save a life

00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.760
It can save a sinner, but I want you to understand that I believe in a gospel that transforms an individual as well

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Listen, we're not talking about Reformation

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.480
We're not talking about trying to clean ourselves up

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.240
We're not talking about trying to do better and I'm gonna it's not by mine own righteousness

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.600
Here's what Isaiah says. All of our good works are as filthy rags

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.580
It's not by works of righteousness, which we have done but according to his mercy that he had saved us for by grace

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.100
We have saved through faith and that not of yourselves

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.100
It is the gift of God not of works

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.780
lest any man should boast in fact in the book of Romans as Paul as Paul is speaking there and

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.740
Giving the illustration in the example going back to history of Abraham

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.820
He talks about Abraham being justified not by works, but by faith. He says if it's by works, then it's a debt

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.820
It's something that Abraham was owed

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.460
God doesn't know us anything

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.780
But in his great love

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.980
He wanted to reconcile us

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.460
to redeem us

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.700
Listen this morning if you're not here if you're here this morning and you're not saved you've never trusted Christ as your Savior

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.020
Can I tell you this morning?

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.220
Today is the day of salvation. In fact in the very next chapter in

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:13.780
2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 the Bible says for he has saith I have heard thee in a time accepted in the day

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:20.020
Of salvation have I suckered thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.260
Salvation

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:28.340
If you're not saved this morning if you do not have 100% assurance that heaven is your home today

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.980
Is the day of your salvation would you trust Christ today?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:39.900
But as we examine this verse of Scripture, I want you to consider with me three thoughts number one the experience of Paul

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:47.060
The experience of Paul as Paul is writing these words as he's speaking about therefore if any man be in Christ

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.900
He is a new creature

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.060
He says that that behold all he says all old things are passed away

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.260
Behold all things are become new

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.260
begin to think about the Apostle Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God penning these words and I

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:07.060
Believe that as Paul was writing these very words that that his mind would rush back to the day in

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.020
Which he trusts that Christ is his personal Savior

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:16.820
Just as I've had the opportunity to recount for you my experience of trusting Christ as my Savior

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.380
We find that the Apostle Paul he experienced the trance

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.140
Transformation in his life. He experienced the power of the gospel

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.540
personally not to just simply reform but to transform

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.180
We find that in Paul's life

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.700
It's Acts chapter number nine turn back if you will and I want you to look at Paul in Acts chapter number nine

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.980
And as we look at this chapter

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:48.900
we really could spend the entirety in Acts 9 this morning and just looking at this experience of Paul and what a great experience it

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.260
Is and we find that it rehearses for us. It gives us the the account of Paul

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.700
Traveling on the road to Damascus. He's going according to verses 1 & 2 his name at this point is Saul

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.740
But notice what the Bible says in Acts 9 in verse number 1 and Saul

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.940
Yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.660
Went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:23.820
But if he found any notice this phrase of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.220
Unto Jerusalem and we find that Saul at this point

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.100
He was dealing with all that had transpired at the end of chapter 7

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.740
We find that a man by the name of Stephen the first martyr of the local church or of the church if you will

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.660
Was martyred there and he stoned and the Bible tells us that they laid

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:51.380
The garments his garments at the feet of Saul and we find that Saul I believe he was dealing with great

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.340
level of

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.140
conviction why

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.140
because he saw Stephen as

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.060
It were his countenance as an angel

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.500
He heard Stephen utter similar words to what Jesus had uttered when he was on the cross

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.260
Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.700
We find that Stephen uttered similar words

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.660
We find that that Saul was under great conviction and what do we do when we're under conviction?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:24.300
well, we either submit or we really get angry about it and Saul is angry and I mean his

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.900
level of

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.460
Attacking the church and all that was going on with the persecution reaches

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.020
its highest point at the start of Acts chapter number 9

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.980
And we find that he's on the way to Damascus then verse number 4

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.700
The Bible says that he was journeying in verse 3 in verse 4

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.660
He had heard this this light this let me read verse 3 and as he journeyed

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.620
he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.140
He saw fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.100
Why persecute us thou me?

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.020
And he saw said who art thou Lord?

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.100
The Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute est

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.540
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks that conviction that he was dealing with

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:18.180
That that imagery that is used here of kicking against the pricks and how they would use them to move

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.100
Livestock and all that they would do and he says listen God saying you're under great conviction

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.580
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks in verse number 6

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.940
The the Bible says that he was trembling and astonished and said Lord

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.660
What wilt thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:42.940
What thou must do in this passage of Scripture we find that Paul

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.660
Experienced what we're speaking of in 2nd Corinthians 5 in verse number 17. He was radically changed

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.980
He was not the same man. He no longer was the same he had experienced

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.980
the power of the gospel

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.500
He'd experienced not only now was he gonna go to heaven when he died because he had accepted the Lord as a Savior

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.060
But we find that his life would forever be changed

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.420
We find that as the Apostle Paul as we refer to him as here

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.860
he's he's blinded and of course we understand as you go through the passage that there was a

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:21.220
Disciple by the name of Ananias that God directed to go and speak to to him to Saul and he comes and he says brother

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.700
Saul what a great

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.740
What a great reference

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:33.220
To now this man who had been known as the persecutor that Ananias is now saying brother Saul

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.380
And I want you to notice in verse number 20 of Acts chapter number 9

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.380
I'll read verse 19 with it

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.100
The Bible says in verse 19 of Acts 9 and when he'd received me

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:50.619
He was strengthened then with Saul certain days with the disciples, which were at Damascus and notice verse 20 and straightway

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.100
He preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:04.220
What a transformation. I mean what an experience that Paul had I understand his name is still Saul here in Acts 9

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:10.619
but I want you to see in his life if you were to read verse 1 and verse 2 and you were to skip verse 3

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:14.580
Through verse 18 and just pick it up in verse 19. It would make zero sense

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:22.179
Because the purpose of him going to the synagogue was so that he could arrest people and bind them and take them to Jerusalem

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.820
He was persecuting but in verse number 20

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:34.100
He's now preaching in the synagogue that Jesus is the Christ the Messiah the promised one God in flesh

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:41.559
If you don't read the middle verses you have no idea what happened to this guy

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.040
but when you read the middle verses you find out he met Jesus and

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:49.559
Jesus changed his life

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.799
He experienced in his life what he's writing about to the church in Corinth

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.160
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature and I think

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.760
Think about Paul thinking back to his life before he was a Christian.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.160
I wonder this morning, I think about my life.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.920
I was 17 when I got saved by the grace of God, and I can remember prior to being 17

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.320
years old, I can remember what my goals and ambitions and desires were.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.120
I can remember how God changed me.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.840
The power of the gospel.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840
Praise the Lord.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.960
That's what Paul experienced.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.920
Notice in the book of Galatians, if you will, and Paul is writing, Galatians chapter 1,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.600
he's writing back to the churches in the region of Galatia.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.080
And as he's writing back, and it's an interesting thing because this is the first region that

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.040
Paul went to on that first missionary journey.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.600
God saved him, and God called him, and then God used him, and Paul ends up in the region

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.840
of Galatia.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840
He's preaching.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.920
There are churches, four of them, that are, as he goes into these four cities in the region

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.880
of Galatia, these churches that are established, and now he's writing back to them.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.400
And I want you to notice the end of chapter 1, the Bible says this, in verse number 23,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:12.040
verse 22, it says, and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.920
Paul was unknown to them, but notice in verse 23, but they had heard only, listen to what

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:26.520
they heard, that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.800
he destroyed, and they glorified God in me.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.540
You know what they heard?

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.920
They heard that that man got saved.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.600
And he once persecuted, but now he's preaching.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.160
Praise the Lord.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.920
And because of what they heard, the Bible says they glorified God in me.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.320
You know what they were doing?

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.520
They were thanking God for the power of the gospel.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.440
They were thanking God for the conversion of this individual.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.520
We begin to think about in our own lives those that God might allow us the opportunity to

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.560
see saved and to see how their lives have been changed, and yes, their eternal destination

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.200
is changed in a moment, but their lives are radically changed by the gospel.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:19.920
We believe a gospel that saves a sinner, but we believe a gospel that transforms a man.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.200
This morning as we look at the text, we note the experience of Paul, but back in 2 Corinthians

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.040
chapter number 5, I want you to notice number 2, the expectation of Paul.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.800
I believe that Paul had an expectation.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.360
He had experienced personally, but I believe that he had an expectation.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.040
You know what that expectation was?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.540
He expected that those that got saved were radically different.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:48.440
He expected that those that trust at Christ as their personal Savior had that same transformation

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.440
that he had experienced.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:56.480
He believed, he expected that these individuals, because he says, therefore, if any man, Paul's

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.740
not just saying that this was my experience because I was something special, because I

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.000
received some special grace.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.920
No, the gospel that saved me is the same gospel that saves you, and the gospel that transformed

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.000
me is the gospel that I expect to transform you.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.800
Does that make sense?

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.520
We find that as the Apostle Paul is writing this church in Corinth, we know some things

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.920
about the church in Corinth.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.200
They're a church that's carnal.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.920
They're a church that's divided.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.400
They're a church that they're dealing with some of this, you know, yes, we're going to

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.520
keep some of those old ways, if you will, but Paul says old things are passed away,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.200
and behold, all things are become new.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.600
And Paul had this expectation that the same God who transformed my life is the same God

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.640
that's going to transform your life.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.160
You ever hear somebody say something like this?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.120
They see somebody that got saved, and they say, now, they really got saved.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.160
And some of the old preachers would kind of talk that way.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.800
They'd get real deep in their voice, and they kind of lean over the pulpit and say, man,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800
they got saved.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.760
Listen, what were they trying to communicate by saying that?

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.520
Well, man, look at their life.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
Look at what...

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.200
But I want you to understand that every single person that gets saved ought to have that

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.480
same level of experience that they got saved.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480
Why?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.960
Because I'm a new creature.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.120
I'm a new creature.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.320
I have a new identity.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.400
After that day in my life on August 31st, 1997, I was no longer my own.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.400
I was bought with a price.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.600
By the way, I was never really my own.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.600
I was a child of the devil, according to John chapter number eight.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.200
Now, I didn't think I was.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.440
I didn't know what that meant.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.480
It's not like I worshiped the devil, but I was lost.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.560
And the reality is that as we look at this truth this morning that Paul had this expectation,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.560
because I had a new identity, I think about our identity in Christ, I think about us as

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560
individuals.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.560
What do we say?

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560
How do we do?

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560
Hey, I'm a Christian.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.480
That's the first thing that identifies us.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
Why?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480
Because I'm in Christ.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480
I'm a new creature.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.680
I've been radically changed.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.960
And Paul had this expectation as Paul went forth and preached the gospel, as Paul went

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.040
to new regions, and he would use that phrase, to the regions beyond you, as Paul would go

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.720
into a new city as he would preach the gospel, he expected that the gospel would have an

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.080
impact on individuals.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.960
He expected that they would not be the same.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.200
Listen, can I explain to you this morning maybe this way?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.640
The truth of salvation is not just taking Jesus and adding him to your shelf.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.120
No.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.760
It's not salvation.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.800
Salvation is not, okay, yeah, I'll just believe Jesus, that's great.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800
Oh, you know what?

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800
I'm going to go to heaven when I die.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800
No, no, no.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.480
No, no, no.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.120
It's transformation.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.520
I don't work for it.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.360
There's nothing I could do to earn it.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.040
But when a man is saved, he is radically different.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.160
We sing the song with the young people.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.200
The things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
Why?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.320
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.320
The places I used to go, I don't go there anymore.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.840
I mean, you can go on different verse after different verse after different verse that

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.200
we sing with the kids in Sunday school and junior church and vacation Bible school, and

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.560
the reality is we try to teach those little kids and the reality is that we need to be

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.680
reminded this morning that I am a new creature.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.200
I shouldn't think the same way.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.200
Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.800
prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.240
Listen, I'm a new creature.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.120
I'm not the same.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.000
If you've ever read our website bio, I put on there that God turned my life right side

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.320
up.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.280
It was radical.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.880
All of a sudden as a senior in high school, having various plans and ideas of what I would

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.560
do with my life, all of a sudden it was more about what God wanted with my life than what

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.560
I wanted with my life.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560
Why?

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.840
Because there's a radical change.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.920
And I don't know this morning what your experience was, but I understand the expectation that

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.720
Paul has.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:25.280
He expected that those that were born again, those that were in Christ were transformed

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.280
by the power of the gospel, that they were new creatures, that those old things were

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.320
passed away, that all things are become new.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.240
Does it mean that we become perfect at the day of salvation?

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.240
No, not even close, because we understand that Ephesians and Colossians, both of those

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.860
letters deal with that process of what we would call in the book of Galatians of walking

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.040
in the Spirit.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.660
And what do they explain in Ephesians and in Colossians?

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.460
There's some things that we're to put off, and there's some things we're to put on.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.080
And we're to walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.880
It doesn't mean that my flesh or your flesh doesn't have those desires anymore.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.520
It simply means that there's a greater one that lives within us, the Holy Spirit of God

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.120
now indwells me.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.200
And we find that there's this expectation that Paul has.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.920
And I wonder this morning, as we look at this verse, and I wonder about these folks in Corinth

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.240
that as they receive this, and they begin to evaluate their own lives, because no doubt

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.800
the Apostle Paul, when he's penning the words, would be reminded of his own personal experience.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:34.800
But he expected that this would be the case for those that have been saved.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.680
I don't know about you, but for me, the Holy Spirit, and I know for everyone that's truly

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.920
born again, the Bible tells us the Holy Spirit lives within us.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920
Amen?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.000
Is that what the Bible teaches us?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
At the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.740
We are sealed in the day of redemption with the Holy Spirit.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.420
So the Holy Spirit of God lives within me.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.260
On that day that I got saved, He indwelled me.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.500
And you know what the Holy Spirit does?

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.740
Man, He convicts us.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.220
Yes, He comforts us as well, but the Holy Spirit of God, He convicts us.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.940
And there were things that maybe I didn't even know a Bible verse yet.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.460
I had not heard the preaching yet.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.780
I was a babe in Christ.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.820
I desired to grow, but the Holy Spirit of God would convict me about certain things.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.460
You shouldn't be doing these things anymore.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.460
Why?

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.460
Because you're a Christian.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.460
You're saved.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.540
You're a new creature.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.740
And it's amazing the work of the Holy Spirit, but here's the problem.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:33.540
For some, as we grow in our faith, as we kind of, I hate to even use the expression, but

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:40.460
I think it's valid, there are times in which sometimes we get over our salvation.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.040
We ought never get over our salvation.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.460
We ought never get over the fact that God saved us.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.100
But I fear for some, it's as if they just kind of get over it.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.900
And they've learned how to quench and to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.660
They no longer are hearing the still small voice.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:04.660
See, Paul had this expectation. He writes about it in the book of Philemon.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.660
Turn over, if you will, quickly. It's only one chapter in the book of Philemon,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.660
but we find in the book of Philemon the Apostle Paul is writing about an individual.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.660
The individual that he's writing about is a man by the name of Onesimus.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.660
Onesimus has this testimony as you read in the book of Philemon, and it's only 25 verses.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.660
It's a short book, just one chapter.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:34.660
And Paul is writing to Philemon, and specifically about Onesimus.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.660
And I want you to notice what Paul says.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.660
Beginning in verse number 10, the Bible says this,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.660
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660
Now, was this guy Onesimus Paul's biological son? No.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.660
Paul refers to Timothy as his son in the faith. He refers to Titus as his son in the faith.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.660
And here he refers to Onesimus as my son.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:05.660
Was he referring to someone that God allowed him, Paul, to lead to Christ that was born again?

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.660
And we find that Paul is writing to Philemon.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.660
See, Philemon, Onesimus had been a slave, and Onesimus had fled.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.660
Philemon was his master.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.660
Paul writes to Philemon, and he says, I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.660
notice, whom I have begotten in my bonds.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.660
Paul was in prison, but he was still preaching the gospel.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.660
Why? Because he knew the power of the gospel.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.660
He knew he'd have been saved by the grace of God,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.660
and he knew he'd have been given to him the ministry of reconciliation.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:46.660
And he's preaching the gospel, and he says that this man, Onesimus, he got saved while I was in bonds.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.660
And notice in verse number 11, which, notice these words,

00:31:50.660 --> 00:32:00.660
in time past was to thee, Philemon, unprofitable,

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:07.660
but now profitable to thee, Philemon, and to me, Paul.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.660
Now, notice these two phrases.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.660
I highlighted them as I read verse number 11.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.660
I have them underlined in my Bible.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:21.660
But notice the contrast between in time past, but now.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.660
In time past, he's unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.660
What happened? Did he go to school? Did he get an education?

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.660
No, what happened was he got saved by the grace of God.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.660
He'd been born again. He was a new creature.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.660
And Paul says, this guy, Onesimus, my son, Onesimus, he was begotten.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:47.660
He was born again while I was in bonds, and he was to thee unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.660
Why? Because he's been saved.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.660
He's not the same guy anymore.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.660
He's been transformed. Amen?

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.660
So Paul has an experience. Paul has an expectation.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.660
This morning, as we look at this verse of Scripture, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:13.660
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.660
All things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:26.660
Often as I share the gospel with individuals, I will say something to them like this when I come to Romans 10 and verse 13.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.660
For whosoever, and I'll say this, Ron, I'll say you can put your name right there.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.660
For whosoever, that means anyone.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.660
So maybe we can read the verse this way.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.660
For if Tim shall call upon the name of the Lord, Tim shall be saved.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.660
Because Tim is a whosoever. Amen?

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.660
And I'm a whosoever. And you're a whosoever.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:55.660
And for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Hallelujah.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.660
As we wrap up the message this morning, we see the experience of Paul.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.660
We see the expectation of Paul.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.660
Number three, I want you to consider this thought, the evidence in my life.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.660
The evidence in my life.

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660
I want you to put your name there where it says, if any man be in Christ.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.660
The same way we would do with Romans 10 and verse 13.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.660
We're trying to lead somebody to Christ and tell them that Christ will save them.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.660
He is able. If any man be in Christ.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.660
And put your name right there where it says any man.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.660
And if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.660
if you were that whosoever in Romans 10, 13 that recognized,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.660
I can't get to heaven on my own.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.660
I recognize that Jesus is the only way.

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.660
Maybe you're here this morning and you've been trying to live some type of religious life.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.660
You've been like Nicodemus. He was a ruler of the Jews.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.660
He was religious.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.660
But religion never saved a man.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.660
You say, but I'm seeking to keep the law.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.660
I had a conversation with someone about two months ago.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.660
They said, well, you know, we're just working to keep the law.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.660
In the very moment that they were telling me they were working to keep the law,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.660
you know what they were doing? Breaking the law.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.660
They didn't even know it.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.660
But they were breaking the law.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.660
When they were telling me that they're seeking to keep the law.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.660
You know what the law does? It condemns.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.660
The law can't save you.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.660
You know what the law does? It points you to the only one that can.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.660
Jesus Christ.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.660
And this morning, if you're not saved,

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.660
you need to insert your name in that Romans 10, 13.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.660
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.660
Religion won't save you.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.660
Good works won't save you.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.660
They can't.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.660
In fact, in the same book, in the book of Galatians, Paul said it this way.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:54.660
If righteousness were obtained by the law, then Christ is dead and vain.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.660
Listen, my Jesus did not die in vain.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:02.660
He died because it was the only way for humanity to be saved.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.660
There's no other way.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.660
No other way.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.660
Jesus had to go to that cross.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.660
And I'm glad he did.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.660
He went willingly. He said it this way.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:17.660
I lay down my life for the sheep.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.660
And I taketh it up again.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.660
Hallelujah, we serve a risen Savior.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.660
But this morning, if you've been saved,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.660
and you've already trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.660
I want you to think about the evidence in your life from Romans,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.660
or from 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.660
And I want you to put your name there.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.660
Therefore, if Chris, that's my name,

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.660
because it says if any man, any individual,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:49.660
if Chris be in Christ, if I've been saved,

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.660
he is a new creature.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.660
Old things are passed away.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.660
Behold, all things are become new.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.660
What's the evidence of salvation in my life?

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:03.660
What's the evidence of salvation in your life?

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.660
See, because the gospel not only saves a man,

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.660
but the gospel transforms a man.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:15.660
And we find that Paul is giving his experience.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.660
He's sharing what his expectation is.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.660
But then for the recipients of this verse of Scripture,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.660
for us today, as we would evaluate or examine,

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.660
what's the evidence point to?

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.660
What does the evidence point to?

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.660
Because if you're in Christ, if you're saved this morning,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.660
you're a new creature.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.660
That's what the Bible says.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.660
It's not just adding another little G-O-D, God,

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:53.660
to your list of, no, Jesus Christ is the only Savior.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.660
How has it changed our lives, the gospel?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.660
What transformation has taken place in your life, in my life?

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.660
Has it changed our behavior?

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.660
The things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.660
Has it changed our thoughts?

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.660
Has it changed our attitude?

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.660
Has it changed our perspective?

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.660
Has it changed our speech?

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.660
Has it changed my pursuits in life?

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.660
Has it changed...

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.660
Listen, I understand that it's on the inside,

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.660
but what's on the inside comes out on the outside.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.660
Amen?

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.660
Has it changed what I value?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.660
Has it changed how I live my life?

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.660
Listen, this morning, before I was ever a pastor,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.660
I've been pastor now for almost 14 years here at this church,

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.660
and I thank God for it.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.660
But I've been saved for a lot longer than 14 years.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.660
I've been pastoring here for 14 years, but you know what?

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.660
From the time I got saved, you know what?

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.660
I was in church all the time after I got saved.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.660
Before I got saved, Ron, I never went to church.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.660
I didn't want to go to church.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.660
Why?

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.660
There was nothing for me there.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.660
I was lost.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.660
I was dead.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:06.660
There was no desire in me to be in church as a lost person.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.660
But after I got saved, man, Sunday school, Sunday morning,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.660
Sunday night, Wednesday night, revival meetings, missions conference,

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.660
bring it on.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.660
Amen?

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.660
And so much the more, as you see the day approaching,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.660
I love to be with the people of God.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.660
But that's not just because I'm a pastor.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.660
It's because I'm a Christian.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.660
Because long before I ever became a pastor, you know what I did?

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.660
I went to church.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.660
Because we're the saints of God gathered together.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.660
The church is a body of believers.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.660
Listen, what do I value in life?

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.660
How do I spend my time?

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.660
How do I spend my treasure?

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.660
How do I use my talents?

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.660
It's all changed because I've been saved and I'm a new creature.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:55.660
And I wonder this morning, have you had that same experience that Paul had?

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.660
Can you evaluate your life?

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.660
Can you see evidence?

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:08.060
in your life of this change. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. I can look

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:18.740
at my life pre-salvation and post-salvation and I can see a radical change. I'm not perfect.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.860
God's still working on me. And by the way, before you get too holy, you're not perfect

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:33.700
either. Amen? Right? Can I get an amen? Come on. None of us are. But one day, this mortal

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:41.820
shall put on immortality. This corruption shall put on incorruption. Amen? That's going

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.580
to be a radical change when I get to heaven. And what a day that will be. It's on the front

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:54.500
of our bulletin this week. What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. But I'm

00:40:54.500 --> 00:41:02.700
asking you this morning, how's your life? Has it been radically changed because of the

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.020
gospel? You're just kind of like, you know what? I'm saved. I'm going to heaven. I'm

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:14.060
still living for myself. I'm still doing my own thing. I still… No, listen. The gospel

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:23.260
transforms an individual. I'm not trying to talk anybody out of being saved this morning.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:30.060
But if I could talk you out of being saved, you better examine yourself. I'm not kept

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:38.540
by my works. I'm kept by God. I'm not kept by my works. But according to Ephesians 2,

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:45.220
8, 9, and then 10, we are His workmanship in Christ Jesus and we are ordained to good

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:51.960
works. Titus talks about, many times, about good works. These works don't save me. These

00:41:51.960 --> 00:42:00.220
works don't keep me saved. But they are a result of this transformation that's in Christ.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:08.620
Paul says, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:16.900
away. Behold, all things are become new. Have you experienced the transformation of the

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.820
gospel? I hope this morning that you can look at your life the same way I could look at

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:27.900
my life, the same way Paul could look at his life. And so, you know what? Prior to that

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:35.260
day that I was traveling to Damascus with those letters giving me the ability to take

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:43.380
captive those that were Christians, to imprison them, prior to that day and after that day,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:52.060
my life was radically different because Jesus changed my life. If you're not saved this

00:42:52.060 --> 00:43:01.140
morning, today is the day of salvation. He wants to save you. And after He saves us,

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:09.020
He wants us to be conformed to the image of His dear Son. That we be like Jesus. Amen?

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:16.260
Romans 8, verse 29, it speaks about that. That we are to be like Christ. It's a great

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.140
work that God does in our lives. This morning, evaluate your life. Has there been a great

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:28.980
change in my life? Could people see it? You meet somebody that you knew prior to being

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:36.220
saved and then you run into them now and they're like, whoa, what happened to you? I got saved.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:43.420
God changed my life. I'm a new creature. Praise the Lord. Let's pray together. Father, we

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:49.420
love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for the power of the Gospel. Thank

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:57.140
You for saving my soul. Thank You for changing my life. Thank You for the testimony of the

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:03.340
Apostle Paul. Lord, I pray that You would help us this morning. If there's one that's

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.860
not saved, God, I pray they'd come to this old-fashioned altar. We'd have an opportunity

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:12.980
to share the Gospel with them. They'd be saved by the grace of God. For every child of God

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:21.720
in this building today, Lord, I pray that we'd evaluate our lives. I pray that not one

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.820
of us have gotten over our salvation, but maybe it'd be true of someone here. They're

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:33.620
just kind of going through the motions, so to speak. God, I pray that You'd help us to

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:41.260
allow You to have Your will in way, that those changes would be evidenced in our lives, proofs

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.820
of salvation, proofs of being a new creature. In this time of invitation, would You have

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.700
Your will in way? We give You the glory for all that You'll do. For it's in Christ's name

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.740
we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
