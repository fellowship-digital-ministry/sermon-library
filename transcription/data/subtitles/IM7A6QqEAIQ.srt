1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
And I know if you looked at the bulletin,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,920
you said, that's not what the bulletin says.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,159
It says Nehemiah.

4
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,679
And I was planning to preach a message

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,000
from the book of Nehemiah.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,520
And I think maybe if the Lord would allow,

7
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,960
I'll preach that message next week,

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,560
but God just didn't give me a piece about it yesterday

9
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,600
and led me in a different direction.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,520
And so I trust to be a blessing to you this morning.

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
Acts chapter number 13,

12
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,959
I've titled the message simply this this morning,

13
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,159
why missions?

14
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:24,280
Why missions?

15
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,559
And on occasion, I've been asked that question,

16
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,440
why missions?

17
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,879
I think that some have inquired

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,720
simply because they've never been taught

19
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,360
and they have a genuine interest in learning

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,400
and understanding why we would place

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,959
an emphasis upon missions.

22
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,279
Others, I believe they are interested in understanding

23
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,319
perhaps a philosophy or a perspective

24
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,720
and their inquiry with this question,

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,599
why missions really would lead to an evaluation personally

26
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:59,360
on why it is that we have such an emphasis upon missions.

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,720
It has been said, people have said this in the past,

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,959
that missions is the heartbeat of God.

29
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,919
I like that statement.

30
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:11,120
God is interested in reaching people

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,480
with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,400
We understand that He's given us a mandate.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,040
He's given us a responsibility

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,919
to preach the gospel to every creature.

35
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,760
Why?

36
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,440
Because He desires for human beings

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,480
to know the way of redemption.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
And we understand this morning

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,639
that as you study the word of God

40
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,480
throughout the whole of scripture,

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,400
you'll find, especially in the Old Testament,

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,160
many references to this,

43
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
that all the earth may know,

44
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,319
that all the world may know

45
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,919
that there's a God in heaven.

46
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,360
And we find this morning

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,120
that as we study the New Testament,

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,360
we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,480
in the person of Jesus Christ,

50
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,080
that Jesus Christ came,

51
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
He lived a perfect and sinless life.

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,800
He went to that cruel cross.

53
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
He was buried and He rose,

54
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,319
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

55
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,639
He ascended to heaven.

56
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,440
He lives forevermore.

57
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,199
He's coming again.

58
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,880
And He's given us a responsibility

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,080
that while we're here,

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,240
we tell somebody about Jesus.

61
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,279
And we find that as we answer this question,

62
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,160
why missions?

63
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,639
Some have said that missions is the heartbeat of God.

64
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,039
And I like that statement.

65
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,919
Others have made this statement

66
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,839
that missions is the lifeline of the church.

67
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,039
And I like that as well

68
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,279
because the church must place an emphasis

69
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:35,039
upon what God has given us to do.

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,240
We must take seriously the responsibility

71
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
that God has given us.

72
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,559
Some have asked it this way.

73
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,479
Why is it that we'd have a missions conference?

74
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,440
Why is it that we'd have missionaries come

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,839
and present like we have this morning?

76
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,839
Why is it that families like the Hector family

77
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,440
and like the Ballou family

78
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,080
that we heard an update on this morning

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,880
that they too are on the road of deputation

80
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,279
seeking to raise support?

81
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,279
Why would someone sell their house?

82
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,600
Why would they live in a camp trailer

83
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
and travel the country?

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,039
Why would they go from church to church

85
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,080
to raise support,

86
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,720
to share the call that God has placed upon their lives,

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,800
to fulfill a call that God has given them?

88
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,960
Why would they do that?

89
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,279
Some have asked this.

90
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:25,080
Why is it that we would give of our personal finances

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
to support missions?

92
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,679
We begin to ask several of these types of questions

93
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:33,520
and I believe the list of questions could go on and on,

94
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,880
but you get the point this morning.

95
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,919
And as we think about answering this question,

96
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,759
why missions?

97
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,679
I'll give you three thoughts this morning,

98
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,800
but the reality is that the list could be far greater

99
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,479
than just three thoughts that I'll give you this morning.

100
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,000
But I want you to fix your attention

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,320
for just a few moments here in Acts 13,

102
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,039
and then we'll be in a number of passages this morning

103
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,399
as we answer this question, why missions?

104
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,360
In Acts chapter number 13,

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,639
we really are breeding of the church in Antioch here

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,880
in the first missionary journey.

107
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,639
And we see what God is doing and how God is working.

108
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course, we know that the Lord Jesus Christ

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
gave the command with regard

110
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,279
as we often refer to it as the Great Commission.

111
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,479
He spelled it out very plainly in Acts 1 in verse number 8,

112
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,839
that it was to be in Jerusalem and all Judea, Samaria,

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,440
and the uttermost part of the earth of the world.

114
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,959
And we find that it was there not until Acts chapter number 8

115
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,000
Brother Hector mentioned it

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
in a Sunday school message this morning,

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,339
that after the persecution intensified,

118
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,660
they were scattered abroad

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,160
and they went everywhere preaching the word they fulfilled.

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,880
In fact, if you read Acts chapter number 8,

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,679
you begin to read how that they went into Samaria.

122
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, that's where God told them to go.

123
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,559
You begin to read there

124
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,100
as you continue through the book of Acts,

125
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,559
how the gospel is going forward.

126
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,200
And of course, this first missionary journey

127
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
in Acts chapter number 13 is recorded for us.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,679
There are a couple of more in the book of Acts,

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,640
but I wanna focus our attention here

130
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,119
for just a few moments on these five verses

131
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:03,119
and answering this question, why missions?

132
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,119
Notice the Bible says in verse number one of Acts 13,

133
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:09,359
now there were in the church that was at Antioch

134
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,000
certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,279
that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manan,

136
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,839
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

137
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,839
So we find right away in verse number one,

138
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,200
that there's a local church in Antioch,

139
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,760
praise God for the local church.

140
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
And this local church was doing

141
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
what God had called them to do.

142
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,359
We find there were there, they were gathered,

143
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,760
there were prophets and teachers,

144
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,200
they're teaching the word of God.

145
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,559
The Bible says in verse number two,

146
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,920
as they ministered to the Lord

147
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,839
and what a blessing to serve God,

148
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,679
what a joy and privilege it is to serve our master,

149
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,760
the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

150
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,079
They were serving, they were ministering,

151
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,760
the Bible says and fasted.

152
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Notice in verse number two,

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,480
the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost said,

154
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,839
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

155
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,079
run to I have called them.

156
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,200
So we find that Saul, of course,

157
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,440
his name during this particular journey will change to Paul

158
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
and we begin to see how that God has called,

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,839
he's placed a specific call

160
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,320
upon the lives of Paul and Barnabas.

161
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,720
And in the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of God says,

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,040
separate me for what purpose?

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,040
For the work where unto I have called them.

164
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,480
The Hector family is doing what they're doing

165
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,880
because God has called them.

166
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,359
The Ballou family is doing what they're doing

167
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,779
because God has called them.

168
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,339
We could go through the list of all of the missionaries

169
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,980
that God has privileged us to partner with

170
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,660
and they're doing what they're doing

171
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,739
because God has placed a call upon their lives.

172
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,140
It's not good enough if mom and dad were to say,

173
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,500
hey, I think you should do this

174
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,619
or if the pastor were to stand up and say,

175
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,299
I think you should do this.

176
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:02,019
The reality is that God Almighty calls people

177
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,420
to serve him in this capacity

178
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,779
and God makes it clear that he's called them.

179
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,380
Notice it says, and when they had fasted and prayed

180
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,299
and laid their hands on them,

181
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,640
notice this, it says, they sent them away.

182
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,459
The church in Antioch, the body of believers

183
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,299
at this local church, they send Paul and Barnabas

184
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,720
to fulfill the mission that God had given them.

185
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,820
We find that it says, so they, verse number four,

186
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,059
being sent forth by the Holy Ghost,

187
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,420
departed from Solution, from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

188
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,260
And that when they were at Salamis, notice this,

189
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,739
they preached the Word of God.

190
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,500
We just heard from Brother Hector.

191
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,260
You're not going there for politics

192
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,540
or for any other purpose.

193
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,660
He's going there because of a person.

194
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,700
That person is Jesus Christ

195
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,260
and he's going to preach the Word of God,

196
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,420
to preach the Gospel.

197
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,260
Why?

198
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,380
For it's the Gospel that's the power of God

199
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,339
unto salvation, amen?

200
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,059
It's the Gospel that we've been called to proclaim.

201
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:03,079
And we understand that Paul says this

202
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:04,720
unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

203
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,399
in 1 Corinthians 15, the Gospel is this,

204
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,600
the death, burial, and glorious resurrection

205
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,619
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

206
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:16,640
that he did all of this according to the Scriptures.

207
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
That's what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15.

208
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,739
And I'm so thankful for the Gospel.

209
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm thankful that someone gave me the Gospel

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,239
and I'm thankful that we have the privilege

211
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,119
of giving the Gospel to someone else.

212
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,600
In fact, just this week, I was at a meeting on Thursday,

213
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,839
but on Tuesday, I received a phone call

214
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,559
from a man that pastors here

215
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,559
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

216
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,760
And he pastors in a place called Snowville

217
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
in the middle of nowhere, down past Roanoke.

218
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,580
And he's in a little, little place,

219
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,080
but he is the father of Sarah Wagar

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,799
that was here back in August visiting with us,

221
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,239
the Wagar family, and they're missionaries in Micronesia.

222
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,239
And she called and said,

223
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,640
hey, dad, we're at this church up in Northern Virginia

224
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,080
and guess who the pastor is?

225
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,919
He's Chris Mann.

226
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,280
And he says, Chris Mann, I know that name.

227
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,119
Well, that man is Tony Hart

228
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:05,960
and he was a member of the church back in 1992

229
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,479
where my dad got saved down in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

230
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,719
And he and his family spent 10 years in Spain

231
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,000
and now he's pastoring here in Virginia.

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
And not only did I get to talk to him

233
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,280
on the phone on Tuesday,

234
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,400
but I got to see him at a meeting on Thursday

235
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,239
that we were both in attendance for.

236
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,159
And I got to sit next to him and chat with him

237
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,400
and just kind of rejoice in what God is doing.

238
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,599
And he looks at me, now Tony is just kind of a small guy.

239
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,400
He's a short fella and very trim.

240
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
And he says, man, last time I saw you,

241
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,919
I don't think you were much bigger than I am.

242
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,359
And man, it's so exciting to see how God works.

243
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:40,359
Listen, God uses the gospel to change lives.

244
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,840
He said, I never would have imagined,

245
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,880
I never would have thought that you were pastoring a church,

246
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,919
that you're serving the Lord, but that's how God works.

247
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,080
Because someone shared the gospel, amen?

248
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
And the gospel has the power to change lives.

249
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,760
And so we see that the Bible says in verse number five,

250
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,359
they preach the word of God.

251
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,099
in the synagogues of the Jews,

252
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,859
and they had also John to their minister."

253
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,659
We will not take the time to read

254
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,899
the entirety of chapter 13 and 14,

255
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,899
but we find that it's in these chapters

256
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,099
that we read about the ministry there,

257
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,659
that first missionary journey.

258
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,819
If you read the book of Galatians,

259
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,859
you will find that the book of Galatians,

260
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,499
unlike some of the other books in the Scriptures,

261
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,939
it will say that it's written

262
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:27,139
unto the churches of Galatia.

263
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,379
Why has it said that?

264
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,219
Because it was the region of Galatia

265
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:32,859
where this first missionary journey took place,

266
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:35,179
and there were multiple churches that were planted.

267
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:37,659
As you would look through chapter 13 and 14,

268
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:40,059
you'll read that they went to Antioch and Pisidia,

269
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,939
Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

270
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,059
And in each of those places,

271
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,659
there were churches established, by the way.

272
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,779
In each of those places,

273
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,599
Paul and Barnabas were chased out of town

274
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,939
because they didn't like there were some

275
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,099
that were in opposition to the work of God.

276
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,679
Opposition is nothing new.

277
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,159
There are people that oppose the Gospel.

278
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,159
And people that oppose the work of God.

279
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,559
It's so exciting as you go to the end of chapter number 14

280
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,439
that you get to this portion of Scripture

281
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,999
and you find the Bible tells us in verse number 26,

282
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,039
and then sailed to Antioch.

283
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,879
That's where we found them in the beginning of Acts,

284
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,679
chapter number 13, they're in Antioch.

285
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,799
And now at the end of chapter number 14,

286
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,639
they sail back to Antioch.

287
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,439
Notice it says from whence they had been recommended

288
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,479
to the grace of God.

289
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:29,319
Notice this phrase, for the work which they fulfilled.

290
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,839
Isn't it exciting to hear about people fulfilling

291
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,679
what God has given them to do?

292
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,799
And then it says this in verse 27,

293
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,519
and when they were come and had gathered

294
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,119
the church together,

295
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,439
they rehearsed all that God had done with them

296
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,279
and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles

297
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,599
and there they abode long time with the disciples.

298
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,759
I often have referred to this portion of Scripture

299
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,439
at the end of Acts 14 as the first missions conference.

300
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,039
It's the first missionary journey

301
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,679
and now it's the first missions conference

302
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,559
where they come back and they report on the work.

303
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,719
By the way, I think the people at the church in Antioch

304
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,759
were interested in hearing what God had done.

305
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,599
Why?

306
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,999
They were invested, they were praying for

307
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,519
these missionaries that were sent out from them.

308
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,679
So we read Acts 13 and we understand

309
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,959
that when we begin to think about this question,

310
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,879
why missions, we would understand that missions is biblical.

311
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,159
Missions is not the idea of some of the,

312
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,159
you'll read about some of the missionaries

313
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,719
and their father of modern missions and what have you.

314
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,839
Some people will give those terminologies or those titles

315
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,079
to some of these great men of God that served a great God

316
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,399
that fulfilled what God had called them to do.

317
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,799
But I want you to understand this morning

318
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,439
that missions is God's idea.

319
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,599
Just like the local church is God's idea,

320
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,319
man did not sit around and say,

321
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,559
you know, I think we should have this thing

322
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,599
called the church.

323
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,239
It is God that instituted the church.

324
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,679
It is God that has instructed the church

325
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,319
and we find that he's given the mandate

326
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:03,759
that the church is to reach the world and he uses missions.

327
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,599
So why is it that we'd have missions?

328
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,639
Let me give you three thoughts this morning

329
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,959
on answering this question, why missions?

330
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,159
Number one, because of the command of our Lord.

331
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,639
Understand this morning that this must be our primary reason.

332
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,879
The primary reason that we would give to,

333
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,519
that we would support missions,

334
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,319
that we would have missions conferences

335
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,839
and support missionaries and what have you,

336
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,399
the primary reason is out of obedience

337
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,479
to the command of our Lord.

338
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,319
We understand that this is primary.

339
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,639
We understand that if we get our eyes off of the fact

340
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
that we're seeking to obey the command,

341
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,479
that the secondary reasons will fail

342
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,719
to continue to motivate us

343
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,519
because it must be that we have our eyes on Jesus

344
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,959
and that we understand that we're doing this

345
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,559
because of the command of our Lord.

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,239
I've knocked on doors before

347
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,919
because God has commanded us to do so

348
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,599
and people weren't so excited to see you there.

349
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,839
If I'm doing it because I think

350
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,719
there's gonna be a warm reception,

351
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,599
after just a little while I'll stop doing it.

352
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:10,319
But the reality is that when we're mindful of the command,

353
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,519
listen to what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 28.

354
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
We're familiar with the Great Commission.

355
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,759
I'll just read it from Matthew chapter 28,

356
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,759
but we find that it's referenced in each of the Gospels

357
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,319
as well as the book of Acts.

358
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,359
In Matthew chapter 28, beginning in verse number 18,

359
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,639
Jesus, after His resurrection, He says this.

360
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,759
Beginning in verse number 18 of Matthew 28,

361
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,559
and Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

362
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,559
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

363
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,559
Isn't that encouraging?

364
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,639
We serve the Lord God Almighty.

365
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,119
He is the omnipotent God.

366
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,479
He has all power.

367
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,639
And then He says this,

368
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,519
go ye therefore and teach all nations,

369
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,879
baptizing them in the name of the Father

370
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,719
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

371
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,279
teaching them to observe all things

372
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,719
whatsoever I have commanded you.

373
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,959
And lo, I am with you always,

374
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,119
even unto the end of the world.

375
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:09,959
Amen.

376
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:15,439
What a blessing to know the command that God has given.

377
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,199
And what a blessing it is that as we read this command

378
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,159
that He tells us really as bookends to the command

379
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,519
that He has all power.

380
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,479
And then He says, I'll be with you.

381
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,000
And that's encouraging.

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,519
That helps us to understand

383
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,639
that we're not going in our own power, our own might,

384
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,839
but we're going in the power of God Almighty.

385
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,359
And we find here that He gives us this promise

386
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,959
and He gives us this command.

387
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,399
And we understand that obedience is necessary.

388
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,839
The Bible tells us this,

389
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,959
as we would think about this command of our Lord,

390
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,839
it is a matter of obedience.

391
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,239
And Jesus said this in John 14 and verse number 15,

392
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,119
if you love me, keep my commandments.

393
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,000
And so we answer the question, why missions?

394
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,119
We must first acknowledge the command of our Lord.

395
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:01,479
And we must understand that this is our primary reason

396
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:04,639
and that it is a matter of obedience.

397
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,359
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 20,

398
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,399
that we are His ambassadors.

399
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,799
We find that the disciples will stand up

400
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,279
and they'll make it known that we are His disciples.

401
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,959
We are His witnesses.

402
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,399
And we understand this morning

403
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,119
that we have the command of the Lord.

404
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,399
And not only is it a command

405
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
that must be obeyed, a matter of obedience,

406
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,319
but I want you to think about it this way as well.

407
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,359
It is a matter of opportunity.

408
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,000
You know, it's an opportunity that we have

409
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,799
to obey the command that Christ has given.

410
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,199
And I think about the opportunity,

411
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,519
I think about the privilege that is ours.

412
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,479
And I want you to notice what Paul says

413
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,839
to the believers in Thessalonica

414
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,119
in 1 Thessalonians chapter number two.

415
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:51,359
And it's in this passage of scripture,

416
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,719
God leads Paul to word this in a certain way

417
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,919
that I think is so encouraging

418
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,599
when we think about the opportunity

419
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,559
that is before us to obey the Lord.

420
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,159
And this morning, when we think about this truth

421
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,639
and we think about the benefit that we have

422
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,439
of having the word of God

423
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,599
and how thankful we are for God's word,

424
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,000
but the reality is that He has given us

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,519
the word of God to be obeyed.

426
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,039
We're told in 1 Thessalonians 2,

427
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,359
beginning in verse number one,

428
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,359
for yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you

429
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,959
that it was not in vain.

430
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,759
If you were to go back to Acts 17,

431
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,239
we will not take the time to do that,

432
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:36,079
but if you were to read the first three verses of Acts 17,

433
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,399
you'll find that God records there

434
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:41,519
the entrance into the city of Thessalonica.

435
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,199
And it's during this missionary journey

436
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,559
that is Paul and they're going there

437
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,479
and they're ministering.

438
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,079
And he says, you know, brethren,

439
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,199
you're aware of our entrance in unto you

440
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,679
that it was not in vain.

441
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,839
But even after that we had suffered before

442
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,359
and were shamefully entreated,

443
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,079
as you know, at Philippi,

444
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,319
that refers back to Acts 16,

445
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,519
we were bold in our God to speak unto you

446
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,199
the gospel of God with much contention.

447
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,039
I'm thankful for the way in which he tells us

448
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,079
in verse number two that they were bold in our God

449
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,119
to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

450
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,639
You understand that Paul makes the request

451
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,079
specifically to the church at Ephesus

452
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,879
that they would pray that he would have boldness,

453
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:26,039
that he would speak the word with boldness.

454
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,719
And we find that he says that they were bold.

455
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,559
Notice in verse number three,

456
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,199
for our exhortation was not of deceit,

457
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,440
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.

458
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,719
Notice how he states this,

459
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:39,640
but as we were allowed of God

460
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,359
to be put in trust with the gospel,

461
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,519
even so we speak.

462
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,359
Can you think about that just for a moment?

463
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,880
We were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel.

464
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,239
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

465
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,519
that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

466
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,359
We've been entrusted.

467
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,839
We are responsible.

468
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,519
We're to be good stewards.

469
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,000
That's why Paul says before he ever says

470
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,279
in Romans one and verse 16,

471
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,679
that I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ

472
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,640
for it is the power of God unto salvation.

473
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,039
He says prior to that,

474
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,719
he says not only am I ready,

475
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,599
but he says I am debtor.

476
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,519
I am indebted.

477
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,359
Why?

478
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,079
He understood that he had been entrusted with the gospel.

479
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,239
He was given this opportunity.

480
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,760
He was allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel.

481
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,519
And then he says, even so we speak,

482
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,519
not as pleasing men,

483
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,839
but God, which triumph our hearts.

484
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,799
You know, there's a number of people that have gone astray

485
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,399
because they try to please men.

486
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,320
A lot of preachers have gone astray

487
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,880
because they try to please men.

488
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,839
But we have the responsibility to please God.

489
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,479
You ever try to talk to somebody about the gospel

490
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,880
and they don't want to hear it?

491
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,719
Why?

492
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,839
Because the message that you're trying to share with them

493
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,679
isn't pleasing to them.

494
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,919
It's confrontational.

495
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,119
It's contentious.

496
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,599
It's not pleasant.

497
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,239
when you've got to sit down and tell somebody that they're lost because they're sinners

498
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:08,639
and they're on their way to a Christless eternity in the lake of fire. A lot of people don't

499
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:15,759
respond well to that. They want you to tickle their ears. They want you to tell them something

500
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,639
that's going to make them feel good and increase self-esteem and so on and so forth. But the

501
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:24,239
reality is if you don't understand you're lost, you're never going to understand that

502
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:31,439
you need a Savior. We find that he says that we came not seeking to please men, but to

503
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,799
please God. And God tries the hearts. I want you to think about this as we think about

504
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,599
the church in Thessalonica. It's not a perfect church. There is no perfect church, but the

505
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:46,199
church in Thessalonica is a model church. It is a good church. And it's from them. If

506
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:50,199
you were to go back to the first chapter, you would find that the Bible says in verse

507
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:55,319
number 7 of chapter 1, so that ye were in samples to all that believe in Macedonia

508
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,719
and Achaia, for from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

509
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:04,959
but also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need not

510
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:11,599
to speak anything. This is missions. They go to Thessalonica in Acts 17 on a missionary

511
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:17,479
journey and they preach the gospel and people get saved. A church is established and from

512
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:22,639
that local church, they're preaching the gospel. Really, if you were to read verse

513
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:28,519
number 8 of 1 Thessalonians 1, it's almost as if Paul is saying, you worked us out of

514
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:33,159
a job. Because everywhere we went, they'd already heard because you were faithful to

515
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:41,879
give the truth. Glory to God. Listen, their labor was not in vain. They went. It was a

516
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:47,099
matter of opportunity. Yes, it's a matter of obedience, but you know, we have opportunity.

517
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:53,339
How long do opportunities last? Sometimes just that long. Someone said this about opportunities.

518
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:58,859
They're easier seeing as they pass us by than as they're coming toward us. How many times

519
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:06,059
we've missed an opportunity? As we have opportunity, Paul uses that phrase actually at the end

520
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,019
of the book of Galatians in chapter 6 and verse 9, he says, and let us not be weary

521
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:15,339
and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore

522
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,779
opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household

523
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,739
of faith. Now, I understand the application here, those that are of the household of faith,

524
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:27,299
but I want you to ask this question this morning by way of application when we think about

525
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:33,019
this verse of Scripture when he says, let us do good unto all men. The greatest thing

526
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:40,699
we can do for anyone is tell them about Jesus. That's the greatest thing we could ever do

527
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:47,819
is tell them about Jesus. I understand that people are hungry and people need various

528
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:53,379
things and they have various needs and we get contacted regularly and if we get so focused

529
00:22:53,379 --> 00:23:02,019
on temporal needs and dealing with those temporal situations and never tell them about Jesus,

530
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:07,819
they're going to die one day and they're going to enter into a Christless eternity. Do good.

531
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:13,859
The greatest thing I can do for anyone is tell them about Jesus. Number one, why missions?

532
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,659
Because of the command of our Lord. Number two, why missions? Because of the condition

533
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:24,419
of the lost. Because of the condition of the lost. John chapter 3 and Brother Hector was

534
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,139
in this passage this morning. I'm just going to mention a few things. If you were in Sunday

535
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:32,419
school you heard him give a lesson. It was a great lesson and really the idea of his

536
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,139
lesson this morning, the title, Fuel for Souls. And then we asked this question, why

537
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:43,899
missions? And we look at John chapter 3, we find that Jesus is speaking to a religious

538
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:49,379
man by the name of Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee. He was a ruler of the Jews. The Bible tells

539
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:55,139
us in verse number one, you find a man that is religious. He knows stuff about God and

540
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,179
there's some people today that have the idea in our world today just knowing about God

541
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:06,899
is okay. I believe there's a God. It's not enough. The Bible tells us in the book of

542
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:12,739
James that the devils believe and tremble. When Jesus walked upon the face of the earth,

543
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:16,259
many times when He encountered those that were demon-possessed, you would find that

544
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,539
those demons would say, have you come to torment us before our time? They knew that He was

545
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:29,019
the Son of God. It's not enough to just believe mentally. The idea of believing scripturally

546
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:34,019
when we read about that truth that you're there in John 3, but in John 1 it says, but

547
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,779
as many as received Him to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that

548
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:43,339
believe on His name. That idea of believing is believing understandingly and receiving

549
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:49,499
Him as our personal Savior. It's not just a mental exercise of believing that there

550
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:56,139
is a God. We find that this religious leader, this Pharisee named Nicodemus, he comes to

551
00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:01,939
Jesus by night and Jesus answers him. The question that he asks, he says, we know that

552
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:06,539
thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except

553
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:12,019
God be with him. And Jesus responded and said, verily, verily, of a truth of a truth I say

554
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:19,499
unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Immediately

555
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:25,899
what Jesus does is He deals with the condition of Nicodemus. He's lost. He's religious, but

556
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:31,499
he's lost. And we find that as He deals with the condition, Nicodemus doesn't understand.

557
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:36,499
He hears this phrase of being born again and he asked a very, really pertinent question.

558
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:40,899
He says this in verse number 4, how can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the

559
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:45,019
second time into his mother's womb and be born? He did not understand what this meant

560
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:50,899
that you must be born again. And Jesus says in verse number 7, marvel not, well, verse

561
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,979
number 6, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit

562
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:59,979
is Spirit. He says in verse number 5, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and

563
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:04,339
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Marvel not that I said unto thee,

564
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,299
ye must be born again. Here's what Jesus is saying to Nicodemus. Listen, everyone here

565
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:13,699
this morning has been born of water. Every single person. Medically speaking, when you

566
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:19,739
understand physiological birth and so on and so forth, we're born of water. Every one of

567
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:30,379
us. But some may not have been born again, being born of the Spirit. If you're here this

568
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:34,739
morning and you're breathing, you're living, you've been born of water. But being born

569
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:41,499
once isn't enough. Nicodemus was born once, but Jesus said you must be born again. Why?

570
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,459
Because there's a condition that you have and the condition of the lost is that they're

571
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,939
dead in their sins and their trespasses. We're going to look at that in just a moment in

572
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:55,299
the book of Ephesians. But he says you must be born again. Born of the Spirit. He says

573
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:02,379
marvel not at this truth. See, Jesus loved Nicodemus enough to tell him the truth. You've

574
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:06,339
been born of water, but you need to be born of the Spirit, Nicodemus. You need to be born

575
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:12,019
again. Listen, being born again is not being baptized. There's some churches that teach

576
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,479
that. Being born again is not going through some class and saying some things and giving

577
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:21,739
some money and going some place. No, no, no. That's not being born again. Being born again

578
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:27,239
is when we understand that we're lost and that Jesus is the only Savior. And we recognize

579
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:32,019
that without him we'll spend eternity in the lake of fire and that he loved me so much

580
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,459
that he died for me. And we say we want to receive that free gift, that eternal life

581
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:40,259
that he offers. And the Bible says that we're born again. The Bible uses the word that we're

582
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:46,619
quickened. We're made alive. It's exciting to be born again. Listen, if you've only been

583
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,739
born once, you've only been born of the water, you need to be born of the Spirit. You need

584
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:57,739
to be born again. See, to be born once is to die twice. Because the Bible talks about

585
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:03,459
physical death. The Bible also talks about spiritual death. We'll look at that in just

586
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:10,019
a few moments. But to be born twice, being born of the water and being born of the Spirit,

587
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,739
is to die but once, die a physical death. That's the point when a man wants to die.

588
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:19,099
But after this, the judgment is what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews in the ninth chapter.

589
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:23,419
So I want you to understand that Jesus is giving Nicodemus the truth. We read that portion

590
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,179
in the beginning, but then the portion that Brother Hector read, verse 15, that whosoever

591
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,179
believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. Notice verse 16, probably one

592
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:37,659
of the most commonly known verses in all of the Bible, for God so loved the world that

593
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,380
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have

594
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,819
everlasting life. You understand that God's greatest attribute is not love. Yes, he loved

595
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:55,099
the world. The Bible tells us that. But his greatest attribute is holiness. We sang this

596
00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:06,259
morning, holy, holy, holy. Our God is holy. And because He's holy, He's just. And there's

597
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:13,899
divine judgment. But He loves His creation. He loves humankind. And so He says, I loved

598
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:20,299
you so much that I sent my Son. See, because there had to be justice. So God so loved the

599
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,940
world that He gave His only begotten Son. What is He speaking of? Well, in verse 14,

600
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:31,579
He talks about Moses being lifted up in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be

601
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:38,579
lifted up. Jesus would go to the cross of Calvary. And Jesus would be the Lamb that

602
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:42,940
was slain before the foundation of the world. He would be the sacrifice. And He says that

603
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,779
He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have

604
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:51,739
everlasting life. Notice what it says in verse 17, for God sent not His Son into the world

605
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:56,859
to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. Why? Because we were condemned

606
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,539
already. He says that in verse 18.

607
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,459
He that believeth on him is not condemned,

608
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,679
but he that believeth not is condemned already,

609
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,379
because he hath not believed in the name

610
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,019
of the only begotten Son of God.

611
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,339
And this is the condemnation,

612
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,339
that light has come into the world,

613
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:12,499
and men love darkness rather than light,

614
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:14,059
because their deeds were evil.

615
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,779
And so we find here that he's saying, listen,

616
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,239
again, understanding this word believe,

617
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,619
it's not just a mental recognition

618
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:24,059
that Jesus walked upon the earth, that Jesus is God,

619
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,399
it's receiving him as your personal Savior.

620
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,699
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 36

621
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:31,479
of John chapter number three.

622
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:35,199
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,

623
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:38,599
and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life,

624
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,719
but the wrath of God abideth on him.

625
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,559
Someone wrote a track, I actually believe it was

626
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,959
Dan Hummel that wrote the track,

627
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,719
I know that Beacon sells it, or has it available.

628
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,879
What do I have to do to go to hell?

629
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:54,719
Nothing.

630
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,099
Because we're already lost.

631
00:30:58,179 --> 00:30:59,999
The condition of the lost.

632
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:04,079
He that believeth not the Son shall not see life,

633
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,559
why, for the wrath of God abideth on him.

634
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,519
He that believeth not, according to verse number 18,

635
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,139
is condemned already.

636
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:13,559
Notice in Ephesians chapter number two,

637
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,999
and as you're turning to Ephesians two,

638
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,759
let me just reference a couple of verses

639
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,159
that you're familiar with from the book of Romans.

640
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:21,879
The book of Romans in chapter three in verses 10 and 23,

641
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,759
the Bible tells us, as it is written,

642
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,799
there is none righteous, no, not one.

643
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:28,299
None.

644
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,259
You say, well, I'm a pretty good person.

645
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,779
Who are you comparing yourself to?

646
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,899
Your neighbor, co-worker?

647
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:42,159
The standard is God, His holiness.

648
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:45,099
The reality is that there's not a man upon the earth

649
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:50,099
that sinneth not, except for Jesus Christ, who was perfect.

650
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,699
He who knew no sin was made sin for us.

651
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,359
The just for the unjust.

652
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,159
But every single human being is guilty of sin.

653
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,639
It's a universal condition.

654
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,999
And I'm thankful that there's a remedy for that condition.

655
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,199
His name is Jesus.

656
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,719
And we find here that in Ephesians chapter number two,

657
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:15,319
the Bible says, and you hath He quickened

658
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,959
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

659
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,639
That word quickened is made alive.

660
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,199
I mentioned this just a moment ago

661
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:23,039
as I referenced this verse of Scripture,

662
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:26,139
but it says you were dead in trespasses and sins.

663
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:30,379
Dad, I was rehearsing with Tony what you heard that day

664
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:32,859
when you were walking through that building

665
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,739
when Kurt Branch said, there are a lot of dead people

666
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,839
in the world that are just waiting to die.

667
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,419
And Brother Tony remembered who Kurt was

668
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,219
and asked me for his contact information.

669
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,619
He said, man, that's a good statement.

670
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,119
I said, yeah, and as soon as my dad heard it,

671
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,819
he said, man, what does that mean?

672
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,699
And my understanding is that that man said

673
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,199
there are a lot of people that are dead spiritually

674
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:59,079
that are just waiting to die a physical death.

675
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,479
And at that moment, my dad's testimony is right here.

676
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,559
He said, that's me.

677
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,759
I'm dead spiritually,

678
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,439
and I'm just waiting to die a physical death.

679
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:13,439
He knew just that much of a testimony of a witness.

680
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,019
God used his word.

681
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,399
It says this in verse number two,

682
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,879
wherein in time past you walked

683
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,559
according to the course of this world,

684
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,739
according to the prince of the power of the air,

685
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:27,419
the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.

686
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,319
Notice what this says, among whom also we all

687
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,259
had our conversation in times past.

688
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,099
Listen, Paul's including himself.

689
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:36,939
Why?

690
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,899
We all had this condition, the condition of the lost

691
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,579
is that we are sinners separated from God Almighty.

692
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,539
We are dead in our trespasses and sins.

693
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:48,539
And he says, we all had this conversation in times past

694
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,139
in the lust of our flesh, notice,

695
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,919
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.

696
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,959
And we're by nature, the children of wrath, even as others.

697
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,559
And I have in box, I don't have it circled

698
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,759
because I don't do circles real good.

699
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,159
So I got a box around it.

700
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:03,839
And if I draw circles, I start crossing out words

701
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,399
and then I can't read it from the pulpit

702
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,479
and it gets real messy.

703
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,159
And so I got a square around it.

704
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,399
These words of verse number four, but God,

705
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,919
I'm so thankful for God,

706
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,639
who is rich in mercy is what the Bible tells us

707
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,759
in verse number four.

708
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,579
Notice where it says, for his great love,

709
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,819
wherewith he loved us.

710
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:28,819
Oh man, I was dead in my trespasses and my sins,

711
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,159
but he quickened me, he made me alive.

712
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,959
I was born again on August 31st, 1997.

713
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:38,979
I know what my birthday is, just like many of you know

714
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,699
what your birthday is, right?

715
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,399
July 15th, 1980, someone said on Thursday,

716
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,899
just as a side note, it's a rabbit trail,

717
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:45,979
I'm gonna kill the rabbit.

718
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,139
And here's what the guy said.

719
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,099
He said, man, this happened in 1976

720
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,879
and some of you guys were just toddlers.

721
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,199
I looked back at the guy and said, I wasn't even alive yet.

722
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,439
I'm not gonna be able to say that a whole lot longer.

723
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,839
This guy here, brother Hector, he's only 27.

724
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,199
He started telling me his wife was born

725
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,199
when I graduated high school.

726
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,479
You start feeling old.

727
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,759
And so I got to remember that I'm not that old.

728
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:11,799
But anyhow, listen, July 15th, 1980

729
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:15,639
is when I was born of water, physically.

730
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,399
But August 31st, 1997, that's the most important day

731
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,499
because that's when I was born again.

732
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,459
I was born of the Spirit.

733
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,539
Jesus said, you must be born again.

734
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:32,019
And I thank God for that date.

735
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:35,339
I thank God that someone told me to remember the date

736
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,479
and to write it down.

737
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,639
And Holly's not here this morning.

738
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,839
Joseph's doing sound, Brianna's over here.

739
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,899
But on August 31st, you know I get a little message

740
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:46,159
from Holly and from the kids and they say,

741
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,659
happy spiritual birthday.

742
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,519
In fact, Brianna and Juliana just had

743
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,759
their spiritual birthday on Thursday of this past week.

744
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:57,199
We sent them a text, happy spiritual birthday.

745
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:00,119
This is when I was born again.

746
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,039
God, who is rich in mercy with his great love,

747
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,159
wherewith he loved us.

748
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,279
Listen, the condition of mankind.

749
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,759
Paul says this in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15.

750
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,399
He says, this is a faithful saying

751
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,199
and worthy of all acceptation

752
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,239
that Christ Jesus came into the world

753
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,939
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

754
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,699
You say, well, I'm just gonna try to be a good person.

755
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,739
Well, just a little while later in Ephesians 2,

756
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:26,619
the Bible tells us you can't be a good person

757
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,119
to get to heaven.

758
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,459
Doesn't work.

759
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:32,179
Titus 3 tells us it's not by works of our righteousness,

760
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:33,139
which we have done.

761
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:36,019
We find that the only payment that's accepted

762
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:39,579
for our eternal security for salvation through Jesus Christ

763
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:42,139
is the blood of Jesus Christ.

764
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,799
That's it.

765
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:44,879
I'm gonna just be a good person.

766
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,999
You can't.

767
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,399
It's not possible.

768
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:50,039
You can be as good as you think you can be.

769
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,599
And at the end of the day, it's still not accepted.

770
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,639
You say, well, that's not fair.

771
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,739
God is God and he made the rules.

772
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,399
And it's right here in the Bible.

773
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,639
Amen?

774
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,559
And this morning, we understand why missions,

775
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,539
number one and primary, because of the command of the Lord.

776
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:15,119
Number two, secondary, because of the condition of the lost.

777
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,779
I wanna say this, number three,

778
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,519
because of the coming of our Lord.

779
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,539
You know, Jesus is coming and he's coming soon.

780
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:26,759
No man knoweth the hour.

781
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,839
I hear regularly people say, in fact,

782
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,359
on Thursday I was at a pastor's meeting

783
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,519
and I heard a number of people use this term

784
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,339
about God tearing his coming.

785
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,559
Listen, Hebrew says that he will not tarry.

786
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,639
He's gonna come right on time.

787
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,479
He knows the time, we don't know the time.

788
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:43,819
But let me say this, and there's a number of verses

789
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:44,659
that we could look at.

790
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,099
I'm just gonna look at one passage in Acts 1

791
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,379
in verses eight through 11.

792
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:49,459
I'm gonna look at this passage

793
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:51,259
because I think it's so instrumental

794
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:54,539
on why we read the book of Acts the way that we do.

795
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,339
The impact that this passage of scripture had

796
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:58,739
on the disciples.

797
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,579
In Acts chapter number one, in verse number eight,

798
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,819
remember they were asking him about whether it was time

799
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:04,859
that he would set up his kingdom.

800
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:05,979
He tells them in verse number seven,

801
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:07,939
it's not for you to know the times or the seasons

802
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:09,939
which the Father hath put in his own power.

803
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,799
Verse eight, but ye shall receive power

804
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,279
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

805
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,199
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

806
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,519
and all Judea and Samaria

807
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,959
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

808
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,759
And so Jesus makes that statement,

809
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:24,519
he speaks those words, and the Bible says in verse number nine

810
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,479
and when he, Jesus, had spoken these things,

811
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:31,899
while they, the disciples, beheld, he was taken up

812
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:34,039
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

813
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:37,159
This is the record of the ascension of Jesus Christ.

814
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,199
Now I want you to think about this event

815
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,659
in the lives of the disciples

816
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,859
and how impactful it would be.

817
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,959
That Jesus is there speaking to them,

818
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,099
he'd already gone to the cross of Calvary,

819
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,699
he had been buried and had risen from the dead,

820
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:52,339
we find that he's been ministering there 40 days,

821
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,219
he's interacted with the disciples,

822
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:56,059
and now he gives them the great commission

823
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:58,380
and as he's speaking the words,

824
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,839
he begins to ascend out of their sight.

825
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,259
Man, that's powerful.

826
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:07,339
It's impactful.

827
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,000
The Bible says, and while they looked steadfastly

828
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,839
toward heaven as he went up,

829
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,000
and I know I've said this before

830
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,699
as I've read this passage of scripture,

831
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:15,959
but you and I'd be standing there

832
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,559
looking steadfastly toward heaven as well.

833
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,019
Amen?

834
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:21,159
He was just talking to us

835
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,679
and now he's ascended out of their sight

836
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,519
and you're just standing there

837
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,839
looking steadfastly up into heaven.

838
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,959
And while they were looking steadfastly up into heaven,

839
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,839
the Bible says two men stood by them in white apparel,

840
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,239
these angels, they say this in verse number 11,

841
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:37,419
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

842
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,619
Notice this, this same Jesus,

843
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,459
which has taken up from you into heaven

844
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:44,820
shall so come in like manner

845
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,899
as ye have seen him go into heaven.

846
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:49,699
Man, Jesus is coming back.

847
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:51,619
And we find that the disciples, listen,

848
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,699
they heard Jesus say this during his earthly ministry

849
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,979
in John chapter number 13

850
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,099
after he'd washed the feet of the disciples

851
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,259
and he'd given them instruction,

852
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:00,579
he gives them the command that they're

853
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:04,479
love as he loved and we find that he gives them that new commandment their

854
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:07,419
hearts are troubled after they find out he's gonna go to the cross and he says

855
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:10,979
let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and

856
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:14,779
John 14 in verse number one he continues in my father's house or many mansions if

857
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:18,579
it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I

858
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:24,219
go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself

859
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:29,379
that where I am there you may be also and now they heard that from Jesus and

860
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:33,259
now they hear from the angels that the angels say hey listen this same Jesus

861
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:39,499
he's coming back what was the last command that they heard Jesus give go

862
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:43,739
and preach the gospel you know why I think we read the book of Acts the way

863
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,859
that we do because they heard Jesus coming back and Jesus gave him a command

864
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:51,219
you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall be

865
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:54,219
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost part of the

866
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,099
earth and so we find that you read the book of Acts and you come to the place

867
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:00,339
as brother Hector mentioned this morning where they turn the world upside

868
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:05,819
down before it ever says that chapters before it says you have filled Jerusalem

869
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:11,739
with your doctrine why Jesus is coming back I want to do

870
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,859
what he's calling me to do I want to fulfill I want to be obedient to the

871
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:18,059
command that he's given me and we find that we read the book of Acts and now

872
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,939
we're nearly 2,000 years past the writing of Acts chapter number one and

873
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:27,659
we find that the truth is still today that Jesus is coming back and I want

874
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,579
you to think about this when you think about the the rapture of the church

875
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:37,379
listen the the James 5 tells us that that the reality is that the coming of

876
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:42,979
the Lord draweth nigh James 3 excuse me 2nd Peter 3 and verse number 9 says hey

877
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:47,219
listen those of you that are saying where's the promises of his coming

878
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:52,819
listen the Lord is not slack concerning his promise but he's long-suffering to

879
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:55,539
us were not willing than any should perish but that all should come to

880
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:59,579
repentance and we find that at the time I want you to consider this very quickly

881
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,539
this morning that when the rapture of the church takes place I want you to

882
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:08,059
think about what happens and I can't go through all of the eschatology of what

883
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:13,939
happens but I just want to give you a couple of thoughts number one we're out

884
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:19,019
of here amen the church the bride of Christ is

885
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:25,139
removed if you read first Thessalonians 4 verses 16 and 18 specifically you find

886
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:28,859
that the Bible tells us of the rapture of the church we are caught up to ever

887
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:35,059
be with the Lord that only causes to rejoice greatly but immediately upon the

888
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:39,179
rapture of the church not only is the church removed but that's the start of

889
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:43,939
the seven-year tribulation period we don't have time to get into all of it

890
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:46,819
this morning but I want you to understand that at the start of that

891
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:51,019
seven-year tribulation that there are many things that are going to happen we

892
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:54,699
find that the book of Revelation reveals to us about the hundred and forty-four

893
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,179
thousand that will proclaim the truth the Bible reveals to us about the two

894
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:01,979
witnesses that will proclaim the truth and we know that there are people that

895
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,699
will be saved during the tribulation but as you understand and you interpret

896
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:09,819
scripture with scripture you will find that primarily Jesus is dealing with

897
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:14,659
the Jewish people the state of Israel during the tribulation his church is

898
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:21,579
removed and here's what the Bible tells us the lost people who rejected the Lord

899
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:29,299
Jesus Christ will remain upon this earth at the rapture the church is removed if

900
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:34,179
you've heard the gospel if you've never trusted Jesus Christ as your personal

901
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:40,739
Savior you will be left there's a popular I've never seen it I've never

902
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:44,579
read it but there's a popular series called left behind and it deals with a

903
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,499
lot of that stuff again I've never read it or watched any of it but the reality

904
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:51,859
is that people will be left behind and here's the reality from second

905
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:56,699
Thessalonians 2 is that those people that heard the gospel and rejected they

906
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:05,899
will believe a lie and they will not be saved you say all I'll deal with that

907
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:12,379
later first of all you never know when you're gonna die second of all you never

908
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:17,859
know when Jesus is coming back he come back today he can biblically speaking he

909
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:21,099
could come back today there's no other prophecy that has to be fulfilled before

910
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:28,099
Jesus returns come back today let me read to you a second Thessalonians 2

911
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,699
second Thessalonians chapter number two I want to read these verses to you and

912
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:42,899
it's so sobering the Bible says this in verse 10 and with all deceivableness of

913
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:47,459
upright and unrighteousness excuse me in them that perish because they receive

914
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:53,099
not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God

915
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:58,099
shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all

916
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:03,259
might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness

917
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:09,699
believe not the truth what is truth Jesus is truth he said I'm the way the

918
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:15,299
truth in the life the Word of God is truth he's given us truth the gospel is

919
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:23,019
truth we find this morning the coming of the Lord draweth nigh listen I don't

920
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:26,939
know the hour or the day but why missions because there's a world that

921
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:32,579
needs to hear the gospel there are people that the population the world is

922
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,179
nearing what 8 billion people now there are people that have never heard the

923
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:42,219
name of Jesus they've never heard the message that we proclaim our brothers

924
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:46,259
going to a place there in Guatemala where there's over 80,000 people in the

925
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:50,939
best that they know there's no gospel preaching church a land of 17 million

926
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:56,859
people with seven church planters do the math that's all I mean you got to

927
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:06,539
reach 2.7 million people each Jesus coming back listen our lives are short

928
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,939
James said this way what is your life it's but a vapor that appears for a

929
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:14,739
little time and then vanishes away the wise men of the book of Proverbs in

930
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:18,779
chapter 27 and verse number one he gives the council to boast not thyself of

931
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:24,019
tomorrow why we know not what's on tomorrow and then I want to remind you

932
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:28,819
what Paul said in 2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 what a great verse of

933
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,819
Scripture and 2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 we think about this

934
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:37,579
truth of why missions and we think about the coming of the Lord Paul says for he

935
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:41,019
saith I have heard thee in a time except in the day of salvation of I suckered

936
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:46,459
they behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation

937
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:51,619
there's no time to delay listen this family the Hector family they want to

938
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:54,779
get to Guatemala you heard him in Sunday school those of you that are here and

939
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:58,499
they want to get to Guatemala why they want to do what God's calling to do

940
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:02,619
they're on deputation and God will develop them and teach them lessons

941
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,979
during deputation that they would not be able to learn otherwise they'll have the

942
00:47:06,979 --> 00:47:09,659
opportunity to minister to people that they would not have been able to

943
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:16,419
minister to otherwise our church being one of that groups of people why do we

944
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:21,219
place an emphasis on missions why do we have every week brother Michael comes on

945
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:24,419
Sunday morning and gives a missions update why do we take the time to put

946
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:28,019
three missionary updates on the back of our prayer bulletin every week why do we

947
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:34,259
invest our dollars personally as a church to missions because of the

948
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:39,619
command of the Lord because of God's command primary he said if you love me

949
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,339
keep my commandments it's a matter of obedience but it's also a matter of

950
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:51,019
opportunity we have opportunity with the freedom to do it right now why

951
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:54,619
because of the condition of the lost we don't have time this morning to read

952
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,859
Revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 but it records for us the great white throne

953
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:11,459
judgment my opinion it's probably the saddest verses of all the Bible because

954
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:18,699
the Bible concludes in verse 15 and says they were cast in a lake of fire this is

955
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:24,139
the second death and whosoever is not found written in the book of life they

956
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:28,339
were cast in a lake of fire this is the second death and it's sad they say how

957
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:34,019
do I get my name in the book we can read through the scriptures about references

958
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,739
in the book of Philippians in the book of Luke about the book our names are

959
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:40,819
written in heaven through accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior

960
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:45,979
a songwriter said there's a new name written down in glory and it's mine oh

961
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:52,339
yes it's mine right that's what the songwriter said this morning first and

962
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:56,339
primary the command of the Lord second the condition of the lost number three

963
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:02,299
the coming of the Lord listen Jesus is coming soon we can do everything we can

964
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:07,939
to obey the command that he's given and that we'd serve God like they did in the

965
00:49:07,939 --> 00:49:17,019
book of Acts with a motivation to please our God understanding that we've

966
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:24,619
been allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel what a privilege let's pray

967
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:31,419
together father we love you how we thank you for loving us this morning the

968
00:49:31,419 --> 00:49:37,259
message why missions primarily to a saved person but God I understand this

969
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:41,579
morning that there may be someone here someone that's tuned in via live stream

970
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,699
that's never trusted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior they've never been

971
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:51,179
born again oh they're alive they were born once they were born of the water

972
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:56,659
they've never understood this truth that we're dealing with this morning you must

973
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:02,579
be born again and God I pray that if there's one Lord

974
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:06,259
lost, that you would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

975
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:07,259
to come.

976
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:10,799
They'd understand that today is the day of salvation.

977
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,899
They would get it settled.

978
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:15,399
They would accept that free gift.

979
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:19,359
The Bible says the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

980
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,759
Jesus Christ our Lord.

981
00:50:20,759 --> 00:50:24,519
Oh, that they'd receive the gift, they'd be saved.

982
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:27,359
Father, I pray for every child of God.

983
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,199
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to understand why missions.

984
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:34,639
Why should we go?

985
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:35,639
Why should we pray?

986
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,439
Why should we give?

987
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,959
Why should we cross the street to be a missionary, to tell someone about Jesus?

988
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:51,359
Help us to be aware of and live daily with the truth of your command.

989
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,159
Understanding is the primary reason.

990
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:56,639
Help us to be mindful of the condition of the lost.

991
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,999
Lord, help us to recognize that soon you are coming.

992
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:07,999
Once you come, once the rapture of the church takes place, no longer will we have an opportunity

993
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,959
to share the gospel with anyone.

994
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:17,079
For all that will be there will be there because their names are written in the book.

995
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,239
When the role was called up yonder, the songwriter said, I will be there.

996
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,159
He had confidence, certainty, because he had trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal

997
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,159
Savior.

998
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:28,159
He'd been born again.

999
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,919
Oh, God, I thank you for the privilege that we have to have a small part in missions,

1000
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:35,039
to be involved in what you're doing globally.

1001
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,239
I thank you for the Hector family who surrendered to the call that you've placed upon their

1002
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,239
lives.

1003
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,759
And God, I pray that you'd use them mightily.

1004
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:45,959
I pray that you'd move and work in these few moments of invitation.

1005
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:51,879
Lord, that we would be responsive to your spirit this day.

1006
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:55,439
And we'll thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1007
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:56,439
Amen.

1008
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:56,439
