WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
And I know if you looked at the bulletin,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.920
you said, that's not what the bulletin says.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.159
It says Nehemiah.

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:05.679
And I was planning to preach a message

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.000
from the book of Nehemiah.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.520
And I think maybe if the Lord would allow,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.960
I'll preach that message next week,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.560
but God just didn't give me a piece about it yesterday

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.600
and led me in a different direction.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.520
And so I trust to be a blessing to you this morning.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.520
Acts chapter number 13,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.959
I've titled the message simply this this morning,

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.159
why missions?

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.280
Why missions?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.559
And on occasion, I've been asked that question,

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:28.440
why missions?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.879
I think that some have inquired

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.720
simply because they've never been taught

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.360
and they have a genuine interest in learning

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.400
and understanding why we would place

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.959
an emphasis upon missions.

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.279
Others, I believe they are interested in understanding

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:47.319
perhaps a philosophy or a perspective

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.720
and their inquiry with this question,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.599
why missions really would lead to an evaluation personally

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.360
on why it is that we have such an emphasis upon missions.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.720
It has been said, people have said this in the past,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.959
that missions is the heartbeat of God.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.919
I like that statement.

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.120
God is interested in reaching people

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.480
with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.400
We understand that He's given us a mandate.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.040
He's given us a responsibility

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.919
to preach the gospel to every creature.

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:22.760
Why?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.440
Because He desires for human beings

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.480
to know the way of redemption.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.040
And we understand this morning

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.639
that as you study the word of God

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.480
throughout the whole of scripture,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.400
you'll find, especially in the Old Testament,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160
many references to this,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.080
that all the earth may know,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.319
that all the world may know

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.919
that there's a God in heaven.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.360
And we find this morning

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120
that as we study the New Testament,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.360
we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480
in the person of Jesus Christ,

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:54.080
that Jesus Christ came,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080
He lived a perfect and sinless life.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.800
He went to that cruel cross.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400
He was buried and He rose,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.319
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.639
He ascended to heaven.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.440
He lives forevermore.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.199
He's coming again.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.880
And He's given us a responsibility

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.080
that while we're here,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.240
we tell somebody about Jesus.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.279
And we find that as we answer this question,

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.160
why missions?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.639
Some have said that missions is the heartbeat of God.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.039
And I like that statement.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.919
Others have made this statement

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.839
that missions is the lifeline of the church.

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.039
And I like that as well

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.279
because the church must place an emphasis

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.039
upon what God has given us to do.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.240
We must take seriously the responsibility

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960
that God has given us.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.559
Some have asked it this way.

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.479
Why is it that we'd have a missions conference?

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.440
Why is it that we'd have missionaries come

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.839
and present like we have this morning?

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.839
Why is it that families like the Hector family

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.440
and like the Ballou family

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.080
that we heard an update on this morning

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.880
that they too are on the road of deputation

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.279
seeking to raise support?

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.279
Why would someone sell their house?

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.600
Why would they live in a camp trailer

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.800
and travel the country?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.039
Why would they go from church to church

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.080
to raise support,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.720
to share the call that God has placed upon their lives,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.800
to fulfill a call that God has given them?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.960
Why would they do that?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.279
Some have asked this.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:25.080
Why is it that we would give of our personal finances

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.960
to support missions?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.679
We begin to ask several of these types of questions

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.520
and I believe the list of questions could go on and on,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.880
but you get the point this morning.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.919
And as we think about answering this question,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.759
why missions?

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.679
I'll give you three thoughts this morning,

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.800
but the reality is that the list could be far greater

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.479
than just three thoughts that I'll give you this morning.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.000
But I want you to fix your attention

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.320
for just a few moments here in Acts 13,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.039
and then we'll be in a number of passages this morning

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.399
as we answer this question, why missions?

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.360
In Acts chapter number 13,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.639
we really are breeding of the church in Antioch here

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.880
in the first missionary journey.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.639
And we see what God is doing and how God is working.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.000
Of course, we know that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.800
gave the command with regard

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.279
as we often refer to it as the Great Commission.

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.479
He spelled it out very plainly in Acts 1 in verse number 8,

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.839
that it was to be in Jerusalem and all Judea, Samaria,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.440
and the uttermost part of the earth of the world.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.959
And we find that it was there not until Acts chapter number 8

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.000
Brother Hector mentioned it

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.040
in a Sunday school message this morning,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.339
that after the persecution intensified,

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:31.660
they were scattered abroad

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.160
and they went everywhere preaching the word they fulfilled.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.880
In fact, if you read Acts chapter number 8,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.679
you begin to read how that they went into Samaria.

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:41.640
Well, that's where God told them to go.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.559
You begin to read there

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.100
as you continue through the book of Acts,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.559
how the gospel is going forward.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.200
And of course, this first missionary journey

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.000
in Acts chapter number 13 is recorded for us.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.679
There are a couple of more in the book of Acts,

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.640
but I wanna focus our attention here

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.119
for just a few moments on these five verses

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:03.119
and answering this question, why missions?

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:06.119
Notice the Bible says in verse number one of Acts 13,

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:09.359
now there were in the church that was at Antioch

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:13.000
certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.279
that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manan,

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.839
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.839
So we find right away in verse number one,

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.200
that there's a local church in Antioch,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.760
praise God for the local church.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.920
And this local church was doing

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.480
what God had called them to do.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.359
We find there were there, they were gathered,

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:34.760
there were prophets and teachers,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.200
they're teaching the word of God.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.559
The Bible says in verse number two,

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.920
as they ministered to the Lord

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.839
and what a blessing to serve God,

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.679
what a joy and privilege it is to serve our master,

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.760
the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.079
They were serving, they were ministering,

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.760
the Bible says and fasted.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.040
Notice in verse number two,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.480
the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost said,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.839
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.079
run to I have called them.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:07.200
So we find that Saul, of course,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.440
his name during this particular journey will change to Paul

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.440
and we begin to see how that God has called,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.839
he's placed a specific call

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.320
upon the lives of Paul and Barnabas.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.720
And in the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of God says,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.040
separate me for what purpose?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.040
For the work where unto I have called them.

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.480
The Hector family is doing what they're doing

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.880
because God has called them.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.359
The Ballou family is doing what they're doing

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:38.779
because God has called them.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.339
We could go through the list of all of the missionaries

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.980
that God has privileged us to partner with

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.660
and they're doing what they're doing

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.739
because God has placed a call upon their lives.

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:52.140
It's not good enough if mom and dad were to say,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.500
hey, I think you should do this

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.619
or if the pastor were to stand up and say,

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.299
I think you should do this.

00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:02.019
The reality is that God Almighty calls people

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:04.420
to serve him in this capacity

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.779
and God makes it clear that he's called them.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:10.380
Notice it says, and when they had fasted and prayed

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.299
and laid their hands on them,

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:16.640
notice this, it says, they sent them away.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.459
The church in Antioch, the body of believers

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:22.299
at this local church, they send Paul and Barnabas

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.720
to fulfill the mission that God had given them.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.820
We find that it says, so they, verse number four,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.059
being sent forth by the Holy Ghost,

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:33.420
departed from Solution, from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.260
And that when they were at Salamis, notice this,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.739
they preached the Word of God.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.500
We just heard from Brother Hector.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.260
You're not going there for politics

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.540
or for any other purpose.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.660
He's going there because of a person.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.700
That person is Jesus Christ

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.260
and he's going to preach the Word of God,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.420
to preach the Gospel.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.260
Why?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.380
For it's the Gospel that's the power of God

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.339
unto salvation, amen?

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.059
It's the Gospel that we've been called to proclaim.

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:03.079
And we understand that Paul says this

00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:04.720
unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.399
in 1 Corinthians 15, the Gospel is this,

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:10.600
the death, burial, and glorious resurrection

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.619
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:16.640
that he did all of this according to the Scriptures.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.880
That's what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.739
And I'm so thankful for the Gospel.

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.160
I'm thankful that someone gave me the Gospel

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.239
and I'm thankful that we have the privilege

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.119
of giving the Gospel to someone else.

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:29.600
In fact, just this week, I was at a meeting on Thursday,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.839
but on Tuesday, I received a phone call

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.559
from a man that pastors here

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.559
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.760
And he pastors in a place called Snowville

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.400
in the middle of nowhere, down past Roanoke.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.580
And he's in a little, little place,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.080
but he is the father of Sarah Wagar

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.799
that was here back in August visiting with us,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.239
the Wagar family, and they're missionaries in Micronesia.

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:53.239
And she called and said,

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:55.640
hey, dad, we're at this church up in Northern Virginia

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.080
and guess who the pastor is?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.919
He's Chris Mann.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:00.280
And he says, Chris Mann, I know that name.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.119
Well, that man is Tony Hart

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:05.960
and he was a member of the church back in 1992

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.479
where my dad got saved down in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:11.719
And he and his family spent 10 years in Spain

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:14.000
and now he's pastoring here in Virginia.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.400
And not only did I get to talk to him

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.280
on the phone on Tuesday,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.400
but I got to see him at a meeting on Thursday

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.239
that we were both in attendance for.

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:22.159
And I got to sit next to him and chat with him

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:24.400
and just kind of rejoice in what God is doing.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.599
And he looks at me, now Tony is just kind of a small guy.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.400
He's a short fella and very trim.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.080
And he says, man, last time I saw you,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.919
I don't think you were much bigger than I am.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:35.359
And man, it's so exciting to see how God works.

00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:40.359
Listen, God uses the gospel to change lives.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:42.840
He said, I never would have imagined,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.880
I never would have thought that you were pastoring a church,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.919
that you're serving the Lord, but that's how God works.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:54.080
Because someone shared the gospel, amen?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.880
And the gospel has the power to change lives.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.760
And so we see that the Bible says in verse number five,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.359
they preach the word of God.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.099
in the synagogues of the Jews,

00:10:03.099 --> 00:10:05.859
and they had also John to their minister."

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:07.659
We will not take the time to read

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:09.899
the entirety of chapter 13 and 14,

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.899
but we find that it's in these chapters

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.099
that we read about the ministry there,

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:15.659
that first missionary journey.

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:17.819
If you read the book of Galatians,

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:19.859
you will find that the book of Galatians,

00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.499
unlike some of the other books in the Scriptures,

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:23.939
it will say that it's written

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:27.139
unto the churches of Galatia.

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:28.379
Why has it said that?

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.219
Because it was the region of Galatia

00:10:30.219 --> 00:10:32.859
where this first missionary journey took place,

00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:35.179
and there were multiple churches that were planted.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.659
As you would look through chapter 13 and 14,

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.059
you'll read that they went to Antioch and Pisidia,

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.939
Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:44.059
And in each of those places,

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:46.659
there were churches established, by the way.

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:47.779
In each of those places,

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:49.599
Paul and Barnabas were chased out of town

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.939
because they didn't like there were some

00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:56.099
that were in opposition to the work of God.

00:10:56.099 --> 00:10:57.679
Opposition is nothing new.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.159
There are people that oppose the Gospel.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.159
And people that oppose the work of God.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:06.559
It's so exciting as you go to the end of chapter number 14

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:08.439
that you get to this portion of Scripture

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:10.999
and you find the Bible tells us in verse number 26,

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:13.039
and then sailed to Antioch.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.879
That's where we found them in the beginning of Acts,

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.679
chapter number 13, they're in Antioch.

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:18.799
And now at the end of chapter number 14,

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:20.639
they sail back to Antioch.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:24.439
Notice it says from whence they had been recommended

00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:25.479
to the grace of God.

00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:29.319
Notice this phrase, for the work which they fulfilled.

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:31.839
Isn't it exciting to hear about people fulfilling

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:34.679
what God has given them to do?

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.799
And then it says this in verse 27,

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:39.519
and when they were come and had gathered

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:41.119
the church together,

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:44.439
they rehearsed all that God had done with them

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:48.279
and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:51.599
and there they abode long time with the disciples.

00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:54.759
I often have referred to this portion of Scripture

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.439
at the end of Acts 14 as the first missions conference.

00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:59.039
It's the first missionary journey

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.679
and now it's the first missions conference

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.559
where they come back and they report on the work.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.719
By the way, I think the people at the church in Antioch

00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:07.759
were interested in hearing what God had done.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.599
Why?

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:10.999
They were invested, they were praying for

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:14.519
these missionaries that were sent out from them.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.679
So we read Acts 13 and we understand

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:18.959
that when we begin to think about this question,

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.879
why missions, we would understand that missions is biblical.

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:26.159
Missions is not the idea of some of the,

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:28.159
you'll read about some of the missionaries

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:31.719
and their father of modern missions and what have you.

00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:34.839
Some people will give those terminologies or those titles

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:38.079
to some of these great men of God that served a great God

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:40.399
that fulfilled what God had called them to do.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.799
But I want you to understand this morning

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.439
that missions is God's idea.

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:47.599
Just like the local church is God's idea,

00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:49.319
man did not sit around and say,

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:50.559
you know, I think we should have this thing

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:51.599
called the church.

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:54.239
It is God that instituted the church.

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:56.679
It is God that has instructed the church

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:59.319
and we find that he's given the mandate

00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:03.759
that the church is to reach the world and he uses missions.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:05.599
So why is it that we'd have missions?

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:07.639
Let me give you three thoughts this morning

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.959
on answering this question, why missions?

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:15.159
Number one, because of the command of our Lord.

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:18.639
Understand this morning that this must be our primary reason.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:21.879
The primary reason that we would give to,

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:23.519
that we would support missions,

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:26.319
that we would have missions conferences

00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:28.839
and support missionaries and what have you,

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:31.399
the primary reason is out of obedience

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:33.479
to the command of our Lord.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.319
We understand that this is primary.

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:38.639
We understand that if we get our eyes off of the fact

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.959
that we're seeking to obey the command,

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:43.479
that the secondary reasons will fail

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:45.719
to continue to motivate us

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:48.519
because it must be that we have our eyes on Jesus

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.959
and that we understand that we're doing this

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:54.559
because of the command of our Lord.

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.239
I've knocked on doors before

00:13:57.239 --> 00:13:58.919
because God has commanded us to do so

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:01.599
and people weren't so excited to see you there.

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:02.839
If I'm doing it because I think

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:04.719
there's gonna be a warm reception,

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.599
after just a little while I'll stop doing it.

00:14:07.599 --> 00:14:10.319
But the reality is that when we're mindful of the command,

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:13.519
listen to what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 28.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.199
We're familiar with the Great Commission.

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.759
I'll just read it from Matthew chapter 28,

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.759
but we find that it's referenced in each of the Gospels

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.319
as well as the book of Acts.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:25.359
In Matthew chapter 28, beginning in verse number 18,

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:29.639
Jesus, after His resurrection, He says this.

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:33.759
Beginning in verse number 18 of Matthew 28,

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:36.559
and Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:41.559
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.559
Isn't that encouraging?

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.639
We serve the Lord God Almighty.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:48.119
He is the omnipotent God.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:49.479
He has all power.

00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:50.639
And then He says this,

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:54.519
go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.879
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:14:56.879 --> 00:14:59.719
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.279
teaching them to observe all things

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:04.719
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:06.959
And lo, I am with you always,

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.119
even unto the end of the world.

00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:09.959
Amen.

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:15.439
What a blessing to know the command that God has given.

00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:18.199
And what a blessing it is that as we read this command

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:21.159
that He tells us really as bookends to the command

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:22.519
that He has all power.

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:24.479
And then He says, I'll be with you.

00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:26.000
And that's encouraging.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.519
That helps us to understand

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.639
that we're not going in our own power, our own might,

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:32.839
but we're going in the power of God Almighty.

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:35.359
And we find here that He gives us this promise

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:36.959
and He gives us this command.

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:40.399
And we understand that obedience is necessary.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.839
The Bible tells us this,

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.959
as we would think about this command of our Lord,

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:45.839
it is a matter of obedience.

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.239
And Jesus said this in John 14 and verse number 15,

00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:53.119
if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.000
And so we answer the question, why missions?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.119
We must first acknowledge the command of our Lord.

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:01.479
And we must understand that this is our primary reason

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:04.639
and that it is a matter of obedience.

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:08.359
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 20,

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:11.399
that we are His ambassadors.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:13.799
We find that the disciples will stand up

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:16.279
and they'll make it known that we are His disciples.

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:17.959
We are His witnesses.

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:19.399
And we understand this morning

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:22.119
that we have the command of the Lord.

00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:24.399
And not only is it a command

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.959
that must be obeyed, a matter of obedience,

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.319
but I want you to think about it this way as well.

00:16:29.319 --> 00:16:31.359
It is a matter of opportunity.

00:16:32.599 --> 00:16:35.000
You know, it's an opportunity that we have

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.799
to obey the command that Christ has given.

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.199
And I think about the opportunity,

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.519
I think about the privilege that is ours.

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:44.479
And I want you to notice what Paul says

00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:45.839
to the believers in Thessalonica

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.119
in 1 Thessalonians chapter number two.

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:51.359
And it's in this passage of scripture,

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:54.719
God leads Paul to word this in a certain way

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:56.919
that I think is so encouraging

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:58.599
when we think about the opportunity

00:16:58.599 --> 00:17:01.559
that is before us to obey the Lord.

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:04.159
And this morning, when we think about this truth

00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:07.639
and we think about the benefit that we have

00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:09.439
of having the word of God

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.599
and how thankful we are for God's word,

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.000
but the reality is that He has given us

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.519
the word of God to be obeyed.

00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:22.039
We're told in 1 Thessalonians 2,

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.359
beginning in verse number one,

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:28.359
for yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you

00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:29.959
that it was not in vain.

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:31.759
If you were to go back to Acts 17,

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.239
we will not take the time to do that,

00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:36.079
but if you were to read the first three verses of Acts 17,

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:38.399
you'll find that God records there

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:41.519
the entrance into the city of Thessalonica.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.199
And it's during this missionary journey

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:45.559
that is Paul and they're going there

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:46.479
and they're ministering.

00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:48.079
And he says, you know, brethren,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:51.199
you're aware of our entrance in unto you

00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:52.679
that it was not in vain.

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.839
But even after that we had suffered before

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.359
and were shamefully entreated,

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.079
as you know, at Philippi,

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:00.319
that refers back to Acts 16,

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:03.519
we were bold in our God to speak unto you

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:07.199
the gospel of God with much contention.

00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.039
I'm thankful for the way in which he tells us

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:12.079
in verse number two that they were bold in our God

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:15.119
to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:17.639
You understand that Paul makes the request

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:20.079
specifically to the church at Ephesus

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:22.879
that they would pray that he would have boldness,

00:18:22.879 --> 00:18:26.039
that he would speak the word with boldness.

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.719
And we find that he says that they were bold.

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:29.559
Notice in verse number three,

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:32.199
for our exhortation was not of deceit,

00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:34.440
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.719
Notice how he states this,

00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:39.640
but as we were allowed of God

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.359
to be put in trust with the gospel,

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.519
even so we speak.

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:47.359
Can you think about that just for a moment?

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.880
We were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.239
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:58.519
that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.359
We've been entrusted.

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:01.839
We are responsible.

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.519
We're to be good stewards.

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:06.000
That's why Paul says before he ever says

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.279
in Romans one and verse 16,

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.679
that I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:11.640
for it is the power of God unto salvation.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.039
He says prior to that,

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.719
he says not only am I ready,

00:19:14.719 --> 00:19:16.599
but he says I am debtor.

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:17.519
I am indebted.

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.359
Why?

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:21.079
He understood that he had been entrusted with the gospel.

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:23.239
He was given this opportunity.

00:19:23.239 --> 00:19:27.760
He was allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.519
And then he says, even so we speak,

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.519
not as pleasing men,

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:35.839
but God, which triumph our hearts.

00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:37.799
You know, there's a number of people that have gone astray

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.399
because they try to please men.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.320
A lot of preachers have gone astray

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.880
because they try to please men.

00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:47.839
But we have the responsibility to please God.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.479
You ever try to talk to somebody about the gospel

00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:51.880
and they don't want to hear it?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.719
Why?

00:19:52.719 --> 00:19:53.839
Because the message that you're trying to share with them

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:55.679
isn't pleasing to them.

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.919
It's confrontational.

00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:59.119
It's contentious.

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:00.599
It's not pleasant.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:04.239
when you've got to sit down and tell somebody that they're lost because they're sinners

00:20:04.239 --> 00:20:08.639
and they're on their way to a Christless eternity in the lake of fire. A lot of people don't

00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:15.759
respond well to that. They want you to tickle their ears. They want you to tell them something

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:20.639
that's going to make them feel good and increase self-esteem and so on and so forth. But the

00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:24.239
reality is if you don't understand you're lost, you're never going to understand that

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:31.439
you need a Savior. We find that he says that we came not seeking to please men, but to

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:36.799
please God. And God tries the hearts. I want you to think about this as we think about

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:40.599
the church in Thessalonica. It's not a perfect church. There is no perfect church, but the

00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:46.199
church in Thessalonica is a model church. It is a good church. And it's from them. If

00:20:46.199 --> 00:20:50.199
you were to go back to the first chapter, you would find that the Bible says in verse

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:55.319
number 7 of chapter 1, so that ye were in samples to all that believe in Macedonia

00:20:55.319 --> 00:21:00.719
and Achaia, for from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:04.959
but also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need not

00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:11.599
to speak anything. This is missions. They go to Thessalonica in Acts 17 on a missionary

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:17.479
journey and they preach the gospel and people get saved. A church is established and from

00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:22.639
that local church, they're preaching the gospel. Really, if you were to read verse

00:21:22.639 --> 00:21:28.519
number 8 of 1 Thessalonians 1, it's almost as if Paul is saying, you worked us out of

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:33.159
a job. Because everywhere we went, they'd already heard because you were faithful to

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:41.879
give the truth. Glory to God. Listen, their labor was not in vain. They went. It was a

00:21:41.879 --> 00:21:47.099
matter of opportunity. Yes, it's a matter of obedience, but you know, we have opportunity.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:53.339
How long do opportunities last? Sometimes just that long. Someone said this about opportunities.

00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:58.859
They're easier seeing as they pass us by than as they're coming toward us. How many times

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:06.059
we've missed an opportunity? As we have opportunity, Paul uses that phrase actually at the end

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:10.019
of the book of Galatians in chapter 6 and verse 9, he says, and let us not be weary

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:15.339
and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:18.779
opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:22.739
of faith. Now, I understand the application here, those that are of the household of faith,

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:27.299
but I want you to ask this question this morning by way of application when we think about

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:33.019
this verse of Scripture when he says, let us do good unto all men. The greatest thing

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:40.699
we can do for anyone is tell them about Jesus. That's the greatest thing we could ever do

00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:47.819
is tell them about Jesus. I understand that people are hungry and people need various

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:53.379
things and they have various needs and we get contacted regularly and if we get so focused

00:22:53.379 --> 00:23:02.019
on temporal needs and dealing with those temporal situations and never tell them about Jesus,

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:07.819
they're going to die one day and they're going to enter into a Christless eternity. Do good.

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:13.859
The greatest thing I can do for anyone is tell them about Jesus. Number one, why missions?

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:17.659
Because of the command of our Lord. Number two, why missions? Because of the condition

00:23:17.659 --> 00:23:24.419
of the lost. Because of the condition of the lost. John chapter 3 and Brother Hector was

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:28.139
in this passage this morning. I'm just going to mention a few things. If you were in Sunday

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:32.419
school you heard him give a lesson. It was a great lesson and really the idea of his

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:37.139
lesson this morning, the title, Fuel for Souls. And then we asked this question, why

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:43.899
missions? And we look at John chapter 3, we find that Jesus is speaking to a religious

00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:49.379
man by the name of Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee. He was a ruler of the Jews. The Bible tells

00:23:49.379 --> 00:23:55.139
us in verse number one, you find a man that is religious. He knows stuff about God and

00:23:55.139 --> 00:23:59.179
there's some people today that have the idea in our world today just knowing about God

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:06.899
is okay. I believe there's a God. It's not enough. The Bible tells us in the book of

00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:12.739
James that the devils believe and tremble. When Jesus walked upon the face of the earth,

00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:16.259
many times when He encountered those that were demon-possessed, you would find that

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:21.539
those demons would say, have you come to torment us before our time? They knew that He was

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:29.019
the Son of God. It's not enough to just believe mentally. The idea of believing scripturally

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:34.019
when we read about that truth that you're there in John 3, but in John 1 it says, but

00:24:34.019 --> 00:24:37.779
as many as received Him to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that

00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:43.339
believe on His name. That idea of believing is believing understandingly and receiving

00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:49.499
Him as our personal Savior. It's not just a mental exercise of believing that there

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:56.139
is a God. We find that this religious leader, this Pharisee named Nicodemus, he comes to

00:24:56.139 --> 00:25:01.939
Jesus by night and Jesus answers him. The question that he asks, he says, we know that

00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:06.539
thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:12.019
God be with him. And Jesus responded and said, verily, verily, of a truth of a truth I say

00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:19.499
unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Immediately

00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:25.899
what Jesus does is He deals with the condition of Nicodemus. He's lost. He's religious, but

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:31.499
he's lost. And we find that as He deals with the condition, Nicodemus doesn't understand.

00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:36.499
He hears this phrase of being born again and he asked a very, really pertinent question.

00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:40.899
He says this in verse number 4, how can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the

00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:45.019
second time into his mother's womb and be born? He did not understand what this meant

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:50.899
that you must be born again. And Jesus says in verse number 7, marvel not, well, verse

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:54.979
number 6, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:59.979
is Spirit. He says in verse number 5, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and

00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:04.339
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Marvel not that I said unto thee,

00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:08.299
ye must be born again. Here's what Jesus is saying to Nicodemus. Listen, everyone here

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:13.699
this morning has been born of water. Every single person. Medically speaking, when you

00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:19.739
understand physiological birth and so on and so forth, we're born of water. Every one of

00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:30.379
us. But some may not have been born again, being born of the Spirit. If you're here this

00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:34.739
morning and you're breathing, you're living, you've been born of water. But being born

00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:41.499
once isn't enough. Nicodemus was born once, but Jesus said you must be born again. Why?

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:45.459
Because there's a condition that you have and the condition of the lost is that they're

00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:48.939
dead in their sins and their trespasses. We're going to look at that in just a moment in

00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:55.299
the book of Ephesians. But he says you must be born again. Born of the Spirit. He says

00:26:55.299 --> 00:27:02.379
marvel not at this truth. See, Jesus loved Nicodemus enough to tell him the truth. You've

00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:06.339
been born of water, but you need to be born of the Spirit, Nicodemus. You need to be born

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:12.019
again. Listen, being born again is not being baptized. There's some churches that teach

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:16.479
that. Being born again is not going through some class and saying some things and giving

00:27:16.479 --> 00:27:21.739
some money and going some place. No, no, no. That's not being born again. Being born again

00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:27.239
is when we understand that we're lost and that Jesus is the only Savior. And we recognize

00:27:27.239 --> 00:27:32.019
that without him we'll spend eternity in the lake of fire and that he loved me so much

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:36.459
that he died for me. And we say we want to receive that free gift, that eternal life

00:27:36.459 --> 00:27:40.259
that he offers. And the Bible says that we're born again. The Bible uses the word that we're

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:46.619
quickened. We're made alive. It's exciting to be born again. Listen, if you've only been

00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:50.739
born once, you've only been born of the water, you need to be born of the Spirit. You need

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:57.739
to be born again. See, to be born once is to die twice. Because the Bible talks about

00:27:58.739 --> 00:28:03.459
physical death. The Bible also talks about spiritual death. We'll look at that in just

00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:10.019
a few moments. But to be born twice, being born of the water and being born of the Spirit,

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:14.739
is to die but once, die a physical death. That's the point when a man wants to die.

00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:19.099
But after this, the judgment is what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews in the ninth chapter.

00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:23.419
So I want you to understand that Jesus is giving Nicodemus the truth. We read that portion

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:28.179
in the beginning, but then the portion that Brother Hector read, verse 15, that whosoever

00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:32.179
believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. Notice verse 16, probably one

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:37.659
of the most commonly known verses in all of the Bible, for God so loved the world that

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:41.380
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:48.819
everlasting life. You understand that God's greatest attribute is not love. Yes, he loved

00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:55.099
the world. The Bible tells us that. But his greatest attribute is holiness. We sang this

00:28:55.099 --> 00:29:06.259
morning, holy, holy, holy. Our God is holy. And because He's holy, He's just. And there's

00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:13.899
divine judgment. But He loves His creation. He loves humankind. And so He says, I loved

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:20.299
you so much that I sent my Son. See, because there had to be justice. So God so loved the

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:23.940
world that He gave His only begotten Son. What is He speaking of? Well, in verse 14,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:31.579
He talks about Moses being lifted up in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:38.579
lifted up. Jesus would go to the cross of Calvary. And Jesus would be the Lamb that

00:29:38.579 --> 00:29:42.940
was slain before the foundation of the world. He would be the sacrifice. And He says that

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.779
He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:51.739
everlasting life. Notice what it says in verse 17, for God sent not His Son into the world

00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:56.859
to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. Why? Because we were condemned

00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:00.539
already. He says that in verse 18.

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:02.459
He that believeth on him is not condemned,

00:30:02.459 --> 00:30:04.679
but he that believeth not is condemned already,

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:06.379
because he hath not believed in the name

00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:08.019
of the only begotten Son of God.

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:09.339
And this is the condemnation,

00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:10.339
that light has come into the world,

00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:12.499
and men love darkness rather than light,

00:30:12.499 --> 00:30:14.059
because their deeds were evil.

00:30:14.059 --> 00:30:15.779
And so we find here that he's saying, listen,

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:18.239
again, understanding this word believe,

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:20.619
it's not just a mental recognition

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:24.059
that Jesus walked upon the earth, that Jesus is God,

00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:27.399
it's receiving him as your personal Savior.

00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:29.699
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 36

00:30:29.699 --> 00:30:31.479
of John chapter number three.

00:30:31.479 --> 00:30:35.199
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,

00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:38.599
and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life,

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:41.719
but the wrath of God abideth on him.

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:46.559
Someone wrote a track, I actually believe it was

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:47.959
Dan Hummel that wrote the track,

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:51.719
I know that Beacon sells it, or has it available.

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:53.879
What do I have to do to go to hell?

00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:54.719
Nothing.

00:30:56.039 --> 00:30:58.099
Because we're already lost.

00:30:58.179 --> 00:30:59.999
The condition of the lost.

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:04.079
He that believeth not the Son shall not see life,

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:06.559
why, for the wrath of God abideth on him.

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.519
He that believeth not, according to verse number 18,

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:11.139
is condemned already.

00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:13.559
Notice in Ephesians chapter number two,

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:14.999
and as you're turning to Ephesians two,

00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:16.759
let me just reference a couple of verses

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:19.159
that you're familiar with from the book of Romans.

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:21.879
The book of Romans in chapter three in verses 10 and 23,

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.759
the Bible tells us, as it is written,

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:25.799
there is none righteous, no, not one.

00:31:26.739 --> 00:31:28.299
None.

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:31.259
You say, well, I'm a pretty good person.

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:34.779
Who are you comparing yourself to?

00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:36.899
Your neighbor, co-worker?

00:31:39.499 --> 00:31:42.159
The standard is God, His holiness.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:45.099
The reality is that there's not a man upon the earth

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:50.099
that sinneth not, except for Jesus Christ, who was perfect.

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:53.699
He who knew no sin was made sin for us.

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:56.359
The just for the unjust.

00:31:56.359 --> 00:32:01.159
But every single human being is guilty of sin.

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:02.639
It's a universal condition.

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:06.999
And I'm thankful that there's a remedy for that condition.

00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:09.199
His name is Jesus.

00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:11.719
And we find here that in Ephesians chapter number two,

00:32:11.719 --> 00:32:15.319
the Bible says, and you hath He quickened

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:17.959
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

00:32:17.959 --> 00:32:19.639
That word quickened is made alive.

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:21.199
I mentioned this just a moment ago

00:32:21.199 --> 00:32:23.039
as I referenced this verse of Scripture,

00:32:23.379 --> 00:32:26.139
but it says you were dead in trespasses and sins.

00:32:26.139 --> 00:32:30.379
Dad, I was rehearsing with Tony what you heard that day

00:32:30.379 --> 00:32:32.859
when you were walking through that building

00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:35.739
when Kurt Branch said, there are a lot of dead people

00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:37.839
in the world that are just waiting to die.

00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:42.419
And Brother Tony remembered who Kurt was

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.219
and asked me for his contact information.

00:32:44.219 --> 00:32:46.619
He said, man, that's a good statement.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:48.119
I said, yeah, and as soon as my dad heard it,

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:49.819
he said, man, what does that mean?

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:52.699
And my understanding is that that man said

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:56.199
there are a lot of people that are dead spiritually

00:32:56.199 --> 00:32:59.079
that are just waiting to die a physical death.

00:32:59.079 --> 00:33:01.479
And at that moment, my dad's testimony is right here.

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.559
He said, that's me.

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:06.759
I'm dead spiritually,

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:08.439
and I'm just waiting to die a physical death.

00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:13.439
He knew just that much of a testimony of a witness.

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:16.019
God used his word.

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:17.399
It says this in verse number two,

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:19.879
wherein in time past you walked

00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:22.559
according to the course of this world,

00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:24.739
according to the prince of the power of the air,

00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:27.419
the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:31.319
Notice what this says, among whom also we all

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:34.259
had our conversation in times past.

00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:36.099
Listen, Paul's including himself.

00:33:36.099 --> 00:33:36.939
Why?

00:33:36.939 --> 00:33:38.899
We all had this condition, the condition of the lost

00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:41.579
is that we are sinners separated from God Almighty.

00:33:41.579 --> 00:33:44.539
We are dead in our trespasses and sins.

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:48.539
And he says, we all had this conversation in times past

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:50.139
in the lust of our flesh, notice,

00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:52.919
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.

00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:55.959
And we're by nature, the children of wrath, even as others.

00:33:55.959 --> 00:33:58.559
And I have in box, I don't have it circled

00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.759
because I don't do circles real good.

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:01.159
So I got a box around it.

00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:03.839
And if I draw circles, I start crossing out words

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:05.399
and then I can't read it from the pulpit

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:06.479
and it gets real messy.

00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:08.159
And so I got a square around it.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:12.399
These words of verse number four, but God,

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:14.919
I'm so thankful for God,

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:18.639
who is rich in mercy is what the Bible tells us

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.759
in verse number four.

00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:22.579
Notice where it says, for his great love,

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:24.819
wherewith he loved us.

00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:28.819
Oh man, I was dead in my trespasses and my sins,

00:34:28.819 --> 00:34:31.159
but he quickened me, he made me alive.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.959
I was born again on August 31st, 1997.

00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:38.979
I know what my birthday is, just like many of you know

00:34:38.979 --> 00:34:40.699
what your birthday is, right?

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.399
July 15th, 1980, someone said on Thursday,

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:44.899
just as a side note, it's a rabbit trail,

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:45.979
I'm gonna kill the rabbit.

00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:47.139
And here's what the guy said.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.099
He said, man, this happened in 1976

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.879
and some of you guys were just toddlers.

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.199
I looked back at the guy and said, I wasn't even alive yet.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:57.439
I'm not gonna be able to say that a whole lot longer.

00:34:57.439 --> 00:34:59.839
This guy here, brother Hector, he's only 27.

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:03.199
He started telling me his wife was born

00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:04.199
when I graduated high school.

00:35:04.199 --> 00:35:05.479
You start feeling old.

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:08.759
And so I got to remember that I'm not that old.

00:35:08.759 --> 00:35:11.799
But anyhow, listen, July 15th, 1980

00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:15.639
is when I was born of water, physically.

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:20.399
But August 31st, 1997, that's the most important day

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:23.499
because that's when I was born again.

00:35:23.499 --> 00:35:25.459
I was born of the Spirit.

00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:28.539
Jesus said, you must be born again.

00:35:29.499 --> 00:35:32.019
And I thank God for that date.

00:35:32.019 --> 00:35:35.339
I thank God that someone told me to remember the date

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:36.479
and to write it down.

00:35:37.499 --> 00:35:39.639
And Holly's not here this morning.

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:41.839
Joseph's doing sound, Brianna's over here.

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.899
But on August 31st, you know I get a little message

00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:46.159
from Holly and from the kids and they say,

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:47.659
happy spiritual birthday.

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:51.519
In fact, Brianna and Juliana just had

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:54.759
their spiritual birthday on Thursday of this past week.

00:35:54.759 --> 00:35:57.199
We sent them a text, happy spiritual birthday.

00:35:58.839 --> 00:36:00.119
This is when I was born again.

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:03.039
God, who is rich in mercy with his great love,

00:36:03.039 --> 00:36:04.159
wherewith he loved us.

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.279
Listen, the condition of mankind.

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:08.759
Paul says this in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15.

00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:11.399
He says, this is a faithful saying

00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:13.199
and worthy of all acceptation

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:16.239
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:20.939
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:22.699
You say, well, I'm just gonna try to be a good person.

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:24.739
Well, just a little while later in Ephesians 2,

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:26.619
the Bible tells us you can't be a good person

00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:28.119
to get to heaven.

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.459
Doesn't work.

00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:32.179
Titus 3 tells us it's not by works of our righteousness,

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:33.139
which we have done.

00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:36.019
We find that the only payment that's accepted

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:39.579
for our eternal security for salvation through Jesus Christ

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:42.139
is the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:43.799
That's it.

00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:44.879
I'm gonna just be a good person.

00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:45.999
You can't.

00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:47.399
It's not possible.

00:36:47.399 --> 00:36:50.039
You can be as good as you think you can be.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:53.599
And at the end of the day, it's still not accepted.

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.639
You say, well, that's not fair.

00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:59.739
God is God and he made the rules.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:03.399
And it's right here in the Bible.

00:37:03.399 --> 00:37:04.639
Amen?

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:07.559
And this morning, we understand why missions,

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:11.539
number one and primary, because of the command of the Lord.

00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:15.119
Number two, secondary, because of the condition of the lost.

00:37:15.999 --> 00:37:18.779
I wanna say this, number three,

00:37:18.779 --> 00:37:20.519
because of the coming of our Lord.

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:24.539
You know, Jesus is coming and he's coming soon.

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:26.759
No man knoweth the hour.

00:37:26.759 --> 00:37:28.839
I hear regularly people say, in fact,

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:30.359
on Thursday I was at a pastor's meeting

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:32.519
and I heard a number of people use this term

00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:34.339
about God tearing his coming.

00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:36.559
Listen, Hebrew says that he will not tarry.

00:37:37.399 --> 00:37:39.639
He's gonna come right on time.

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:41.479
He knows the time, we don't know the time.

00:37:42.419 --> 00:37:43.819
But let me say this, and there's a number of verses

00:37:43.819 --> 00:37:44.659
that we could look at.

00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:47.099
I'm just gonna look at one passage in Acts 1

00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:48.379
in verses eight through 11.

00:37:48.379 --> 00:37:49.459
I'm gonna look at this passage

00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:51.259
because I think it's so instrumental

00:37:51.259 --> 00:37:54.539
on why we read the book of Acts the way that we do.

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:57.339
The impact that this passage of scripture had

00:37:57.339 --> 00:37:58.739
on the disciples.

00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:01.579
In Acts chapter number one, in verse number eight,

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.819
remember they were asking him about whether it was time

00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:04.859
that he would set up his kingdom.

00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:05.979
He tells them in verse number seven,

00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:07.939
it's not for you to know the times or the seasons

00:38:07.939 --> 00:38:09.939
which the Father hath put in his own power.

00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:12.799
Verse eight, but ye shall receive power

00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:15.279
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:17.199
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

00:38:17.199 --> 00:38:18.519
and all Judea and Samaria

00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:19.959
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:21.759
And so Jesus makes that statement,

00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:24.519
he speaks those words, and the Bible says in verse number nine

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:27.479
and when he, Jesus, had spoken these things,

00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:31.899
while they, the disciples, beheld, he was taken up

00:38:31.899 --> 00:38:34.039
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:37.159
This is the record of the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:39.199
Now I want you to think about this event

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:40.659
in the lives of the disciples

00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:42.859
and how impactful it would be.

00:38:42.859 --> 00:38:44.959
That Jesus is there speaking to them,

00:38:44.959 --> 00:38:47.099
he'd already gone to the cross of Calvary,

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:49.699
he had been buried and had risen from the dead,

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:52.339
we find that he's been ministering there 40 days,

00:38:52.339 --> 00:38:54.219
he's interacted with the disciples,

00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:56.059
and now he gives them the great commission

00:38:56.059 --> 00:38:58.380
and as he's speaking the words,

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.839
he begins to ascend out of their sight.

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:04.259
Man, that's powerful.

00:39:05.419 --> 00:39:07.339
It's impactful.

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:10.000
The Bible says, and while they looked steadfastly

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.839
toward heaven as he went up,

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:13.000
and I know I've said this before

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.699
as I've read this passage of scripture,

00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:15.959
but you and I'd be standing there

00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:18.559
looking steadfastly toward heaven as well.

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:20.019
Amen?

00:39:20.019 --> 00:39:21.159
He was just talking to us

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:22.679
and now he's ascended out of their sight

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:23.519
and you're just standing there

00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:25.839
looking steadfastly up into heaven.

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:27.959
And while they were looking steadfastly up into heaven,

00:39:27.959 --> 00:39:30.839
the Bible says two men stood by them in white apparel,

00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:33.239
these angels, they say this in verse number 11,

00:39:33.259 --> 00:39:37.419
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:41.619
Notice this, this same Jesus,

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:43.459
which has taken up from you into heaven

00:39:43.459 --> 00:39:44.820
shall so come in like manner

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.899
as ye have seen him go into heaven.

00:39:47.899 --> 00:39:49.699
Man, Jesus is coming back.

00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:51.619
And we find that the disciples, listen,

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:54.699
they heard Jesus say this during his earthly ministry

00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:55.979
in John chapter number 13

00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:58.099
after he'd washed the feet of the disciples

00:39:58.099 --> 00:39:59.259
and he'd given them instruction,

00:39:59.259 --> 00:40:00.579
he gives them the command that they're

00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:04.479
love as he loved and we find that he gives them that new commandment their

00:40:04.479 --> 00:40:07.419
hearts are troubled after they find out he's gonna go to the cross and he says

00:40:07.419 --> 00:40:10.979
let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and

00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:14.779
John 14 in verse number one he continues in my father's house or many mansions if

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:18.579
it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I

00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:24.219
go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:29.379
that where I am there you may be also and now they heard that from Jesus and

00:40:29.379 --> 00:40:33.259
now they hear from the angels that the angels say hey listen this same Jesus

00:40:33.259 --> 00:40:39.499
he's coming back what was the last command that they heard Jesus give go

00:40:39.499 --> 00:40:43.739
and preach the gospel you know why I think we read the book of Acts the way

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:47.859
that we do because they heard Jesus coming back and Jesus gave him a command

00:40:47.859 --> 00:40:51.219
you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall be

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:54.219
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost part of the

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:57.099
earth and so we find that you read the book of Acts and you come to the place

00:40:57.099 --> 00:41:00.339
as brother Hector mentioned this morning where they turn the world upside

00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:05.819
down before it ever says that chapters before it says you have filled Jerusalem

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:11.739
with your doctrine why Jesus is coming back I want to do

00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:14.859
what he's calling me to do I want to fulfill I want to be obedient to the

00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:18.059
command that he's given me and we find that we read the book of Acts and now

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:22.939
we're nearly 2,000 years past the writing of Acts chapter number one and

00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:27.659
we find that the truth is still today that Jesus is coming back and I want

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.579
you to think about this when you think about the the rapture of the church

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:37.379
listen the the James 5 tells us that that the reality is that the coming of

00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:42.979
the Lord draweth nigh James 3 excuse me 2nd Peter 3 and verse number 9 says hey

00:41:42.979 --> 00:41:47.219
listen those of you that are saying where's the promises of his coming

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:52.819
listen the Lord is not slack concerning his promise but he's long-suffering to

00:41:52.819 --> 00:41:55.539
us were not willing than any should perish but that all should come to

00:41:55.539 --> 00:41:59.579
repentance and we find that at the time I want you to consider this very quickly

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:04.539
this morning that when the rapture of the church takes place I want you to

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:08.059
think about what happens and I can't go through all of the eschatology of what

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:13.939
happens but I just want to give you a couple of thoughts number one we're out

00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:19.019
of here amen the church the bride of Christ is

00:42:19.019 --> 00:42:25.139
removed if you read first Thessalonians 4 verses 16 and 18 specifically you find

00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:28.859
that the Bible tells us of the rapture of the church we are caught up to ever

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:35.059
be with the Lord that only causes to rejoice greatly but immediately upon the

00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:39.179
rapture of the church not only is the church removed but that's the start of

00:42:39.179 --> 00:42:43.939
the seven-year tribulation period we don't have time to get into all of it

00:42:43.939 --> 00:42:46.819
this morning but I want you to understand that at the start of that

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:51.019
seven-year tribulation that there are many things that are going to happen we

00:42:51.019 --> 00:42:54.699
find that the book of Revelation reveals to us about the hundred and forty-four

00:42:54.699 --> 00:42:58.179
thousand that will proclaim the truth the Bible reveals to us about the two

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:01.979
witnesses that will proclaim the truth and we know that there are people that

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:05.699
will be saved during the tribulation but as you understand and you interpret

00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:09.819
scripture with scripture you will find that primarily Jesus is dealing with

00:43:09.819 --> 00:43:14.659
the Jewish people the state of Israel during the tribulation his church is

00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:21.579
removed and here's what the Bible tells us the lost people who rejected the Lord

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:29.299
Jesus Christ will remain upon this earth at the rapture the church is removed if

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:34.179
you've heard the gospel if you've never trusted Jesus Christ as your personal

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:40.739
Savior you will be left there's a popular I've never seen it I've never

00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:44.579
read it but there's a popular series called left behind and it deals with a

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:48.499
lot of that stuff again I've never read it or watched any of it but the reality

00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:51.859
is that people will be left behind and here's the reality from second

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:56.699
Thessalonians 2 is that those people that heard the gospel and rejected they

00:43:56.699 --> 00:44:05.899
will believe a lie and they will not be saved you say all I'll deal with that

00:44:05.899 --> 00:44:12.379
later first of all you never know when you're gonna die second of all you never

00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:17.859
know when Jesus is coming back he come back today he can biblically speaking he

00:44:17.859 --> 00:44:21.099
could come back today there's no other prophecy that has to be fulfilled before

00:44:21.099 --> 00:44:28.099
Jesus returns come back today let me read to you a second Thessalonians 2

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:32.699
second Thessalonians chapter number two I want to read these verses to you and

00:44:32.699 --> 00:44:42.899
it's so sobering the Bible says this in verse 10 and with all deceivableness of

00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:47.459
upright and unrighteousness excuse me in them that perish because they receive

00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:53.099
not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:58.099
shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all

00:44:58.099 --> 00:45:03.259
might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness

00:45:03.259 --> 00:45:09.699
believe not the truth what is truth Jesus is truth he said I'm the way the

00:45:09.699 --> 00:45:15.299
truth in the life the Word of God is truth he's given us truth the gospel is

00:45:15.299 --> 00:45:23.019
truth we find this morning the coming of the Lord draweth nigh listen I don't

00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:26.939
know the hour or the day but why missions because there's a world that

00:45:26.939 --> 00:45:32.579
needs to hear the gospel there are people that the population the world is

00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:37.179
nearing what 8 billion people now there are people that have never heard the

00:45:37.179 --> 00:45:42.219
name of Jesus they've never heard the message that we proclaim our brothers

00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:46.259
going to a place there in Guatemala where there's over 80,000 people in the

00:45:46.259 --> 00:45:50.939
best that they know there's no gospel preaching church a land of 17 million

00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:56.859
people with seven church planters do the math that's all I mean you got to

00:45:56.859 --> 00:46:06.539
reach 2.7 million people each Jesus coming back listen our lives are short

00:46:06.539 --> 00:46:09.939
James said this way what is your life it's but a vapor that appears for a

00:46:09.939 --> 00:46:14.739
little time and then vanishes away the wise men of the book of Proverbs in

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:18.779
chapter 27 and verse number one he gives the council to boast not thyself of

00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:24.019
tomorrow why we know not what's on tomorrow and then I want to remind you

00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:28.819
what Paul said in 2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 what a great verse of

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:32.819
Scripture and 2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 2 we think about this

00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:37.579
truth of why missions and we think about the coming of the Lord Paul says for he

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:41.019
saith I have heard thee in a time except in the day of salvation of I suckered

00:46:41.019 --> 00:46:46.459
they behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:51.619
there's no time to delay listen this family the Hector family they want to

00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:54.779
get to Guatemala you heard him in Sunday school those of you that are here and

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:58.499
they want to get to Guatemala why they want to do what God's calling to do

00:46:58.499 --> 00:47:02.619
they're on deputation and God will develop them and teach them lessons

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:06.979
during deputation that they would not be able to learn otherwise they'll have the

00:47:06.979 --> 00:47:09.659
opportunity to minister to people that they would not have been able to

00:47:09.659 --> 00:47:16.419
minister to otherwise our church being one of that groups of people why do we

00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:21.219
place an emphasis on missions why do we have every week brother Michael comes on

00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:24.419
Sunday morning and gives a missions update why do we take the time to put

00:47:24.419 --> 00:47:28.019
three missionary updates on the back of our prayer bulletin every week why do we

00:47:28.019 --> 00:47:34.259
invest our dollars personally as a church to missions because of the

00:47:34.259 --> 00:47:39.619
command of the Lord because of God's command primary he said if you love me

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:43.339
keep my commandments it's a matter of obedience but it's also a matter of

00:47:43.339 --> 00:47:51.019
opportunity we have opportunity with the freedom to do it right now why

00:47:51.019 --> 00:47:54.619
because of the condition of the lost we don't have time this morning to read

00:47:54.619 --> 00:48:00.859
Revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 but it records for us the great white throne

00:48:00.859 --> 00:48:11.459
judgment my opinion it's probably the saddest verses of all the Bible because

00:48:11.499 --> 00:48:18.699
the Bible concludes in verse 15 and says they were cast in a lake of fire this is

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:24.139
the second death and whosoever is not found written in the book of life they

00:48:24.139 --> 00:48:28.339
were cast in a lake of fire this is the second death and it's sad they say how

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:34.019
do I get my name in the book we can read through the scriptures about references

00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:36.739
in the book of Philippians in the book of Luke about the book our names are

00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:40.819
written in heaven through accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior

00:48:40.939 --> 00:48:45.979
a songwriter said there's a new name written down in glory and it's mine oh

00:48:45.979 --> 00:48:52.339
yes it's mine right that's what the songwriter said this morning first and

00:48:52.339 --> 00:48:56.339
primary the command of the Lord second the condition of the lost number three

00:48:56.339 --> 00:49:02.299
the coming of the Lord listen Jesus is coming soon we can do everything we can

00:49:02.299 --> 00:49:07.939
to obey the command that he's given and that we'd serve God like they did in the

00:49:07.939 --> 00:49:17.019
book of Acts with a motivation to please our God understanding that we've

00:49:17.019 --> 00:49:24.619
been allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel what a privilege let's pray

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:31.419
together father we love you how we thank you for loving us this morning the

00:49:31.419 --> 00:49:37.259
message why missions primarily to a saved person but God I understand this

00:49:37.259 --> 00:49:41.579
morning that there may be someone here someone that's tuned in via live stream

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:45.699
that's never trusted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior they've never been

00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:51.179
born again oh they're alive they were born once they were born of the water

00:49:51.179 --> 00:49:56.659
they've never understood this truth that we're dealing with this morning you must

00:49:56.659 --> 00:50:02.579
be born again and God I pray that if there's one Lord

00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:06.259
lost, that you would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

00:50:06.259 --> 00:50:07.259
to come.

00:50:07.259 --> 00:50:10.799
They'd understand that today is the day of salvation.

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:12.899
They would get it settled.

00:50:12.899 --> 00:50:15.399
They would accept that free gift.

00:50:15.399 --> 00:50:19.359
The Bible says the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:20.759
Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:50:20.759 --> 00:50:24.519
Oh, that they'd receive the gift, they'd be saved.

00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:27.359
Father, I pray for every child of God.

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:33.199
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to understand why missions.

00:50:33.199 --> 00:50:34.639
Why should we go?

00:50:34.639 --> 00:50:35.639
Why should we pray?

00:50:35.639 --> 00:50:37.439
Why should we give?

00:50:37.439 --> 00:50:43.959
Why should we cross the street to be a missionary, to tell someone about Jesus?

00:50:43.959 --> 00:50:51.359
Help us to be aware of and live daily with the truth of your command.

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:54.159
Understanding is the primary reason.

00:50:54.159 --> 00:50:56.639
Help us to be mindful of the condition of the lost.

00:50:56.639 --> 00:51:02.999
Lord, help us to recognize that soon you are coming.

00:51:02.999 --> 00:51:07.999
Once you come, once the rapture of the church takes place, no longer will we have an opportunity

00:51:07.999 --> 00:51:10.959
to share the gospel with anyone.

00:51:10.959 --> 00:51:17.079
For all that will be there will be there because their names are written in the book.

00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:21.239
When the role was called up yonder, the songwriter said, I will be there.

00:51:21.239 --> 00:51:26.159
He had confidence, certainty, because he had trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal

00:51:26.159 --> 00:51:27.159
Savior.

00:51:27.159 --> 00:51:28.159
He'd been born again.

00:51:28.159 --> 00:51:32.919
Oh, God, I thank you for the privilege that we have to have a small part in missions,

00:51:32.919 --> 00:51:35.039
to be involved in what you're doing globally.

00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:39.239
I thank you for the Hector family who surrendered to the call that you've placed upon their

00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:40.239
lives.

00:51:40.239 --> 00:51:42.759
And God, I pray that you'd use them mightily.

00:51:42.759 --> 00:51:45.959
I pray that you'd move and work in these few moments of invitation.

00:51:45.959 --> 00:51:51.879
Lord, that we would be responsive to your spirit this day.

00:51:51.879 --> 00:51:55.439
And we'll thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:51:55.439 --> 00:51:56.439
Amen.

00:51:56.439 --> 00:51:56.439
