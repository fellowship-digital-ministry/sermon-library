1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
number 29 this evening, Genesis chapter number 29, and I mentioned last week as we were taking

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,479
our path through the first section of Genesis 29, really looking at verses 1 through 30,

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:17,520
and in that study we traced the steps of Jacob as he arrived to Haran, and it's interesting

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,280
because we noted in verse number 1 of Genesis 29, the Bible says, then Jacob went on his journey,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,440
and I made the statement that the journey continues, and what a blessing to read about

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,119
the experience that Jacob had at the end of Genesis 28, and the Lord appearing to him,

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,119
and the Lord speaking to him, and his commitments to God, and setting up the altar there at Bethel,

8
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,439
and what a blessing to read about that experience, and the impact of that experience that he had,

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,439
but the journey continues, and I kind of likened it to our own lives, and how

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,400
we can think about that day of our salvation when we recognized our need for Christ,

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,119
and he saved our soul, and then we continue our journey, and we know that Jacob's journey

12
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,080
ends as we read of his death later on here in the book of Genesis, and our journey, too,

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,279
will end one day, but as we journey with the Lord, that we'd be mindful of the importance

14
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:16,800
of keeping our eyes on him, and keeping our eyes on Jesus. Hebrews chapter number 12 says,

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,160
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, and I'm so thankful this evening that

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,080
he has provided us with instruction. Just as Jacob would deal with adversity, and hardships,

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,879
and interactions with people that were kind, and people that were not so kind, and all of

18
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,000
the things that he would deal with, we, too, have a variety of interactions that we face in life.

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:48,000
As we wrapped up Genesis 29, the first section, verses 1-30 last week, we left off where Jacob

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,680
ended the text of Scripture with two brides, Leah and Rachel, and as we think about the

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,760
word of God, and we think about what God has provided us with, really, as we've studied

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,000
through the book of Genesis, it's been a long time, this is message number 67, in fact, of

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,279
preaching through the book of Genesis, and I've thoroughly enjoyed it, I trust that you have as

24
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:12,559
well, and as we look here at these next several, really, I'm probably going to split this into two

25
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:17,520
weeks of lessons of messages, but as we begin this evening looking at the sons of Jacob,

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,199
we will begin to navigate through this section of Scripture, and read of how God blessed,

27
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:31,279
and God built this family, and we understand there's many just discussions that take place

28
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:35,520
in this passage of Scripture, and you begin to think about the carnality that's present,

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,240
you think about the competition that is evidenced, and you see all of these things,

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,919
but I believe that as we study through this passage of Scripture, and we trace

31
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,880
through this passage, I believe that there's a lesson for us to learn here.

32
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:56,880
I believe that as you go through and study the names, in particular, of the sons of Jacob,

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,440
you will be able to note, not only through the names of the sons, but through the dialogue that

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,839
is given, that there is a real conflict between Leah and Rachel, and we've mentioned in previous

35
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:13,039
messages of having dysfunctional families, and looking at the dysfunctional families here in

36
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,479
Genesis already that we've looked to, and mentioning how that in our society, still today, there are

37
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:25,119
many dysfunctional families, and I'm thankful that God has given us a book that gives us instruction

38
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:29,839
with regard to the home, and how a family is supposed to operate, and what God's design

39
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:35,759
is for the home. But as we note, as you go through the passage of Scripture, you see the conflict,

40
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,440
and I believe that the conflict is most easily evidenced and really traced through the names of

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,320
the sons, and the significance of their names, and really the dialogue, and what takes place.

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,360
And so, of course, you know that there are twelve sons, and that's why I think it's going to take

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,520
us two weeks to get through it. There are twelve sons, and of course, they would become the twelve

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,919
tribes of Israel, and we're mindful of that, and we understand as you begin to look at the

45
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,520
whole of the history that God provides us with in the Old Testament, with regard to His people,

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,839
the children of Israel, and you think about the tribes, and obviously you look here to the

47
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:15,839
fulfillment of what God said to Abraham with regard to the promise of a seed and a land,

48
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:21,440
and then of course that promise was given to Isaac, and then reiterated to Jacob as we studied

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,320
in a previous message, where God had given him the instruction with regard to the blessing of a

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,239
large family. As we begin reading in verse number 31 of Genesis 29, and we look at this first section

51
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:40,239
or this first of two messages on the sons of Jacob, notice the Bible says this in verse 31,

52
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:44,640
and when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren,

53
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,399
and Leah conceived and bare a son, and she called His name Reuben, and she said,

54
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,079
Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction, now therefore my husband will love me. And she

55
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,040
conceived again and bare a son, and said, Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, He hath

56
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,519
therefore given me this son also. And she called His name Simeon, and she conceived again, verse 34,

57
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,440
and bare a son, and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,200
borne him three sons, therefore was his name called Levi. And she conceived again and bare a

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,559
son, and she said, Now will I praise the Lord, therefore she called His name Judah, and left

60
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:31,359
bearing. As we look at the sons of Jacob, I want you to see in verse number 32,

61
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:36,720
the first of these sons is Reuben. The Bible tells us that she conceived in verse number 32,

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,959
and that she bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. The name Reuben really,

63
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,839
it carries with it the idea of this, behold a son. You think about the significance of the

64
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,720
families and understanding in the culture, the significance of having a son, and the importance

65
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,200
of having a son, and you find here that right at the beginning, when we find that Reuben is born,

66
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,559
that Leah would name Reuben, behold a son. That's what the name means. And when you think about the

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,320
phraseology and understanding the significance of having a son, and I want you to see what she says

68
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,320
here in this text of Scripture, it says this in verse number 32,

69
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,160
for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction. And so she was acknowledging that the

70
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,640
Lord had looked upon her affliction. What is the affliction that she's referring to? Well,

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,519
it's in verse number 31, where the Bible says that the Lord saw that Leah was hated. You'll

72
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,359
remember that the Bible tells us of Jacob and his marriage in the previous text of Scripture,

73
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:48,000
and we dealt with that two weeks ago in looking at the deception and what have you,

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,959
and the Bible tells us that the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was

75
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,920
barren. You'll remember that the Bible told us in verse number 30 that he went also unto Rachel,

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:08,320
and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And so we find that Leah, in naming her first son,

77
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,000
she uses this name, behold a son, the significance of having a son, but she also mentions that the

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,519
Lord hath looked upon her affliction. Again, it gives us evidence to this conflict that was brewing

79
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,799
between Leah and Rachel, and we'll continue to see this as we trace through the names of

80
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:30,880
these sons and through this text of Scripture. And then I want you to notice the end of verse

81
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,399
number 32. Notice what she says, now therefore my husband will love me. She had the belief,

82
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:46,880
she had the expectation that because she had had a son and because she had given in her mind this

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,679
son to Jacob and the significance of having a son, that this would change the dynamic in the family

84
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:59,760
and that the circumstances would be more favorable for her, and now she would be loved by Jacob.

85
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,119
You see that she has high expectations. She has full anticipation that this would be the case,

86
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,640
and we see the significance and the confidence that she has. We note here a couple of very

87
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,839
important truths. Number one, I would say this, understand that God sees everything. Notice what

88
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:24,160
she says, she called his name Reuben. Why? Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction. You know

89
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,399
that God sees everything. He knows everything, and even as she makes that statement, and even

90
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,960
though there's some conflict and some animosity that will continue to grow and develop here

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,880
between Leah and Rachel, we can rejoice in knowing that God sees everything. Sometimes we can get

92
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,239
down and we can get discouraged and we can begin to think, no one understands, no one sees what I'm

93
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:54,799
dealing with. God understands, God sees, and that ought to cause us to rejoice because it says in

94
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:01,599
verse 31 that the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and we should rejoice in understanding here this

95
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:08,479
evening that truth that is revealed to us. We also would note her recognition. Notice what Leah says,

96
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:13,760
her recognition of Jehovah God. Notice here the Bible says that Leah conceived and bear a son,

97
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,919
she called his name Reuben. Well, she said this, surely the Lord, it's all caps in your Bible

98
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,960
referring to Jehovah God, and I want you to consider the fact that she says the Lord hath

99
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:33,840
looked upon my affliction, and she is acknowledging, she is recognizing Jehovah God. In every event in

100
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,239
our life, we need to recognize the hand of Almighty God. As we trace through the steps of

101
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,799
these passages of Scripture and begin to see the birth of the sons of Jacob, we will be able to

102
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:55,599
note with ease the times of carnality and the lack of recognition of God Almighty. It's extremely

103
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,919
evident throughout the text of Scripture. And this evening when we look at...

104
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,599
this passage and see what's taking place and we begin to observe the carnality that will brew and

105
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:11,839
develop here, it's important that we recognize that there is a struggle that is taking place

106
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,519
between walking in the Spirit as a New Testament application of walking in the Spirit and walking

107
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:25,439
in the flesh. And oh, how necessary it is that we'd walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill

108
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:31,439
the lust of the flesh. Note with me in our text of Scripture, moving on into verse number 33,

109
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:36,079
the second son is born, Simeon is his name. The Bible says that she conceived again in verse

110
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:43,279
number 33, and she bare a son. Notice she says, because the Lord hath heard that I was hated,

111
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,639
he hath therefore given me this son also, and she called his name Simeon. Isn't it good to know that

112
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,439
God sees but God hears? He sees and he hears. She says here in this text of Scripture, the Lord hath

113
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:04,159
heard that I was hated, and we see that the name Simeon means hearing or heard, and she's

114
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,519
acknowledging the fact that God had heard about her circumstances. Now, I want you to think just

115
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,439
for a moment because she had high expectations in verse 32, did she not? She thought that because

116
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,199
of having that first son, that it would change the dynamics and that Jacob would now love her,

117
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:26,319
and that's what she desired, and that's what she wanted, but yet the Bible tells us in verse number

118
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:32,719
33, as you begin to see the progress and what's taking place, that evidently her expectations were

119
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:38,559
not met. It did not pan out the way that she expected it to, and she says that the Lord hath

120
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,279
heard that I was hated. She says this as we think about the second birth, and she says,

121
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,559
therefore, because of this, the Lord hath given me this son. Once again, her acknowledgement of

122
00:11:52,559 --> 00:12:00,319
Jehovah God is evident to us, for it says, because the Lord, again in all caps, hath heard that I was

123
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:09,039
hated. And she's continuing to understand and to recognize Jehovah God. Not only do we rejoice in

124
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,999
knowing that the Lord sees, but also that the Lord hears. And these truths that are revealed to us

125
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,519
through the first two sons of Jacob should cause us to rejoice this evening, and we should find

126
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:31,359
great comfort in knowing that God sees and God hears. Verse 34, the Bible tells us that she

127
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,919
conceived again. Here we'll see the birth of Levi, the third son of Jacob, and notice what she says,

128
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,039
and again, there's a measure of confidence on the part of Leah. She conceived and bear a son,

129
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:50,479
and now notice what she says, now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born

130
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:59,279
him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi. Levi, of course, the tribe of the Levites,

131
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,719
as we'd be familiar with and understand all of the significance of that tribe, but you look at

132
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:09,519
that name Levi, and it carries with it the idea of being joined to, and you see that in the verse

133
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:18,239
of Scripture, associated with or attached to. And the anticipation, the expectation of Leah

134
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:24,239
was that now, because of this, now my husband will be joined unto me. You see that that's what

135
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:30,079
she's longing for, that's what she's desiring. She recognizes here, but notice what she says

136
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,599
in verse 34 at the end of the verse, because I have born him three sons. There's an obvious

137
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:45,199
omission here in verse number 34 with regard to the birth of Levi, the third son. The obvious

138
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,919
omission in the text of Scripture is that there's no recognition whatsoever of God.

139
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:58,079
It's missing altogether. You begin to think in our lives of how we go through life, and there

140
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,119
are times in which we have expectations, and sometimes our expectations aren't met.

141
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,559
Making a little application here, we understand the context and the interpretation of what's

142
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,279
happening in the sons of Jacob being born, and the expectation of Leah with regard to her husband,

143
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:17,919
but the reality is that in life we have expectations. We have certain things that

144
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,799
we're expecting to happen, and at times in our lives when those expectations are not met,

145
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,879
when we're disappointed because of what we thought would happen, it can cause us to revert

146
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:35,759
in our spiritual walk. It can cause us to not recognize the hand of God. It can cause us to

147
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,519
become carnal, if you will. And we notice here in the text of Scripture that there's no reference

148
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,079
to God, and in fact what she says is, I have born Him three sons. Now, we understand that

149
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:55,359
children are an heritage of the Lord. In fact, Jacob will note that in the first couple of

150
00:14:55,359 --> 00:15:03,999
verses of chapter number 13. But there's an obvious change in perspective here, and we

151
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:09,199
understand what Leah's dealing with. We can look at the text, and we can see just the turmoil within

152
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,119
the family, and the conflict that's there, and we don't read much of Rachel yet, but really,

153
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:19,759
as we look at the text of Scripture and we see that the Bible tells us that Rachel was loved,

154
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,679
and Leah was not loved as much, and in fact it says that the Lord saw that she was hated,

155
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,479
and we find that Leah is in this position where she's longing for what Rachel has.

156
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,399
But you know what's interesting? Rachel is longing for what Leah has

157
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:42,399
in chapter number 30 in the first couple of verses. And how applicable in our lives

158
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,319
that we long for what somebody else has, and someone else is longing for what we have.

159
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,599
And here we find that she begins to be so consumed for this longing that she's having,

160
00:15:55,599 --> 00:16:02,959
that now she's failing to recognize the Lord. She's in this position now where she's saying,

161
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,719
I have born Him three sons, and there's no reference at all. She goes from referencing

162
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:16,559
God as Jehovah, His proper name, the self-existent One, understanding this highest title,

163
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,719
proper name of God, and now there's no reference, no acknowledgement whatsoever.

164
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,079
But as we move into verse number 35, it's kind of interesting as to the dynamics and what changes,

165
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,679
and I think it's exciting for us to look at this application and to be helped. It says in verse 35

166
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,759
that she conceived again and bear a son, and notice what she says, now will I praise the Lord.

167
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,279
I like the change in perspective, right? Because in the first three sons, in the birth of Reuben,

168
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,199
in the birth of Simeon, in the birth of Levi, she has this expectation that now because of

169
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,999
behold a son, this firstborn, this son, that now my husband, he's going to love me and I'm going to

170
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,479
have this relationship that I long for, and she has that expectation. She says of Levi when he's

171
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:14,239
born that my husband will be joined unto me, but now at the birth of Judah, the fourth son,

172
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:22,879
the Bible says that she says this, now will I praise the Lord. Again, the name is Jehovah.

173
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:34,079
Jehovah. She says, therefore, she called his name Judah and left bearing. The name Judah literally means

174
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:43,279
praise. You think about the change and events that's taking place, and she says this, now will I

175
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:50,559
praise the Lord. Her joy and her praise would now be in the Lord. It seems as if she would no longer

176
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,639
be focused upon the conflict with Rachel. It seems as if no longer is she's going to seek to

177
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:02,079
have that joy or that satisfaction or that fulfillment in something that's changing

178
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:09,519
and ever-changing, but no, my joy, my praise is going to be in the Lord Jehovah. Oh man, that's good for us

179
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:18,079
because we sang tonight, yesterday, today, and forever, Jesus Christ the same. By the way, I didn't pick

180
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,319
the song, Dean did, and I love how it just fits so perfectly. We begin to focus upon the Lord and

181
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:30,799
focus upon Him being our joy. The joy of the Lord is your strength, and He is our joy. He's our peace,

182
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:37,279
and we can rejoice in Him, and we find that her focus for just a moment, it's going to change,

183
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:44,479
but at this particular moment in her life, her focus is upon, I'm going to praise the Lord.

184
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,599
I'm going to praise God, and I believe that it's extremely impactful as she acknowledges

185
00:18:54,479 --> 00:19:01,760
again Jehovah God. Of course, we know from the tribe of Judah would come the kings of Israel.

186
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,919
We know that it's our Lord Jesus Christ that came from the tribe of Judah, and He is King of Kings.

187
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,119
Amen? And we can rejoice in that. We can begin to see what's happening, and so at this particular

188
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,639
juncture in the life of Jacob and his family, and how God is giving him sons, we see that there's

189
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,959
this situation where Leah now has born four sons, and as we move into chapter number 30, we now are

190
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:33,679
given the introduction, if you will, the discussion with regard to Rachel and Jacob that takes place

191
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,760
in these first two verses. Notice in chapter 30 and verse number one, the Bible says,

192
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:46,479
and when Rachel saw that she bared Jacob no children, notice this, Rachel envied her sister.

193
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,719
Let me tell you that envy is never a good thing. Amen? It's never a good thing, and she envied

194
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:59,839
her sister, and notice what she says unto Jacob, give me children or else I die.

195
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:08,519
Yeah. Jacob says, it says in verse number two, that his anger was kindled against

196
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,679
Rachel. He said, am I in God's stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the

197
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,559
womb? In other words, he's acknowledging here in this text of Scripture that the

198
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,919
fruit of the womb is his reward. That it's beyond my ability. It is God

199
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,239
that blesses with conception. And we acknowledge that in the Word of God. We

200
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:34,599
we see that that's why life is precious. Amen. We think about the discussion in

201
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:39,479
our society today with regard to when does life begin and the subject matters

202
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:43,399
that are so prevalent in our society. And we believe that life matters. We believe

203
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:50,239
that life has value. Why? Because life is a gift of God. And it is God that has

204
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:56,119
given that life. And we understand the gift of God. The life that he gives. And

205
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:03,919
we understand the value of life because of the giver of life. And to understand

206
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,719
in an even greater significance of why life matters and why life is valuable is

207
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:15,199
the very truth that the Bible tells us. That the same God that gives life. That

208
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:21,879
that same God died so that we could have eternal life. Now that adds a level of

209
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:28,319
value beyond anything that we can fully comprehend. Amen. And we find this evening

210
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,759
that when Jacob is confronted by Rachel and she says give me children or else I

211
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,799
die. He acknowledges that it's God that gives children. That the fruit of the

212
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,479
womb is his reward. I've mentioned it a moment ago but it's important for us to

213
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:49,079
know that Rachel is envying and she's desiring what Leah had. And Leah all

214
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:56,839
along has been envying and desiring what Rachel had. So we find in our text of

215
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,319
Scripture, and we'll skip a few verses and you can read those later if you'd

216
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,679
like to, but for sake of the families that are here this evening I'll skip

217
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,879
down to verse number six. And as you look at verse number six you see the fifth

218
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:21,199
son, Dan is his name. You see the level of carnality, the fleshly behavior that

219
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:27,319
has interjected itself into the text of Scripture. And Rachel said in verse

220
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,679
number six, because it was Bilhah that had conceived and bared Jacob, this son

221
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,799
number five, according to verse number five. And it says that Rachel said God

222
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,359
hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son. Therefore

223
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:53,959
called she his name Dan. The name Dan means judge or vindicator. And really as

224
00:22:53,959 --> 00:23:00,239
Rachel makes this declaration and following some legal legalities, if you

225
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:06,119
will, that were accepted in this particular time and culture. She says God

226
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,479
hath judged me, he hath heard me, and he hath given me a son. I believe that as

227
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:17,599
you look at the name of Dan, the son of Bilhah, and see that his name means

228
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,639
judge or vindicator, there's no doubt in my mind that really she's naming her son

229
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:28,839
Dan and making sure that Leah knows all about it. Because God has vindicated me,

230
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:33,759
is really her idea. And as you think about the the truth here of what's

231
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,279
taking place, and again if we could think about the carnality and the

232
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,999
fleshly behavior of Rachel and all that's taking place, we can begin to see

233
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:48,759
how things will very quickly erode. And how that all of a sudden, where Leah

234
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,359
at the end of chapter number 29 is focused wholly and completely on, now

235
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,319
will I praise the Lord. And it seems as if at that point that no longer would

236
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,719
Leah be concerned or focused with the conflict that was brewing there with

237
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:10,279
Rachel, but now as Rachel will give in to some carnal, fleshly approach, all of a

238
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,199
sudden it's going to have an impact on Leah. You know what Leah is going to do?

239
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:21,959
She's going to respond in like manner. Can we not see application for our own

240
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:31,359
lives? Someone treats us inappropriately, they're in the flesh, they're carnal, and we

241
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,599
sometimes feel like that gives us a right to be in the flesh. Right? Does it

242
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,799
not? Well they said that, so I'm gonna say this, I'm gonna give them a piece of my

243
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,159
mind. Somebody said be careful, it might be the last piece. But the reality is

244
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,039
that we can very quickly get into the flesh when someone else is in the

245
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,759
flesh. We can very easily become carnally minded when we're interacting with

246
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,279
people that are carnally minded. And here Rachel is going to become carnal and

247
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,279
fleshly and going to a place where she's relying on some

248
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,759
different approach to receive the reward that she desires, and it's going to

249
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:23,039
have a great impact upon Leah. Judge, vindicator, son number five. I want you

250
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,479
to notice that Rachel acknowledges God in our text of Scripture. In verse

251
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:33,439
number six she says this, and Rachel said, God hath judged me. You notice that it's

252
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:39,439
not Lord. It's not the all-caps Lord. It's God. It's Elohim is the name, and of

253
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:44,399
course that's a name of God. It means strong one, but she's not acknowledging

254
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:51,759
Him as Jehovah. At one point she will, but right now she's not. Why is she not

255
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,719
acknowledging Him as Jehovah? Well, I can only assume there's some carnal behavior

256
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:01,119
that's taking place, and therefore she's not able to be in the place where she's

257
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:08,719
recognizing that He is Jehovah God. As you continue down through the text of

258
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:14,119
Scripture, the Bible tells us of son number six that is born. In verse number

259
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,599
eight it says that Rachel said, with great wrestlings have I wrestled with my

260
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,399
sister, and I have prevailed, and she called his name Naphtali. Son number six

261
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,559
is Naphtali. His name literally means wrestling, and I want you to think about

262
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,759
this and what we've already hinted at throughout the message this evening with

263
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,399
regard to this struggle and this conflict and this strife between these

264
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:43,759
two sisters, between the wives of Jacob, is fully revealed to us in verse number

265
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,159
eight of Genesis chapter number 30, because notice what she says, I have

266
00:26:48,159 --> 00:27:03,519
wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. You see the focus on the part

267
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,519
of Rachel again as she's leaning on these fleshly and carnal way of dealing

268
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,759
with things, we see that she's acknowledging this conflict with her

269
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:22,239
sister. It's a terrible family dynamic, wouldn't you agree? It's crazy what takes

270
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:26,999
place in the passage of Scripture and the family dynamic, but as we begin to

271
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:30,959
note the historical truth that's given to us in the interpretation

272
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:34,679
and understanding the sons of Jacob, but we make some application in our lives, we

273
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,879
can find that we too can go to a place in our lives where we resort to some

274
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:46,439
carnal fleshly approach to life. And all of a sudden we can think that my

275
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:53,359
struggles and my wrestling are with some other human being, when in all reality, as

276
00:27:53,359 --> 00:28:00,359
we think about the spiritual warfare that we're engaged in, we have misplaced

277
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:09,279
efforts on the part of Rachel, misplaced priorities. She's so desiring for this

278
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:17,319
end result that she's going to employ anything that she can in order to win.

279
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:25,019
I've wrestled and I've prevailed. That's what she says. Is it interesting to you in

280
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:30,619
verse number 8 that there's no reference to God? Do you see it again? We noted it

281
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,619
with Leah in verse number 34 of Genesis chapter 29, and now in Genesis 30, in

282
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:40,219
verse number 8, where the son of, when Dan, the sixth, excuse me, fifth son is born,

283
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:46,139
she acknowledges God as Elohim, but as the carnality continues, as that fleshly

284
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:50,779
desire is revealed to us, that now when she names son number six,

285
00:28:51,779 --> 00:29:03,219
there's no reference to God. What a sad position to be in, isn't it? We just get so fleshly

286
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:17,019
and so carnal that we're not even acknowledging God. Unfortunately, Leah has observed what

287
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:27,339
has happened, what has transpired. She's heard about Dan. Vindicated. Judge. She's

288
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:35,339
heard here about Naphtali. Wrestling. I've prevailed. According to verse number 35 of

289
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:41,579
Genesis 29, the Bible ends with these three words in left bearing, and all of a

290
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,139
sudden, Leah is in a position, remember she's the older sister, and she's in a

291
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:49,099
position where she's not had any children, and now she's seeing Rachel in

292
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,539
this fleshly and carnal approach, and she's observed what has

293
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:59,979
transpired, and so now she would employ the same carnal approach.

294
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:04,179
She goes from the height of, really, if I could call it this evening,

295
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,179
spirituality in verse number 35, when she says,

296
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,279
now will I praise the Lord Jehovah.

297
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:19,679
I'm focused upon God Almighty, and His name shall be called Judah, praised.

298
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:29,979
And she leaves that place, that height of spirituality, to get into a mud fight.

299
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:39,679
Someone said this, you can't throw mud without getting your hands dirty.

300
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,179
It's very sad if you read verse 9 and 10,

301
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,179
and all of a sudden in our text of Scripture,

302
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:56,179
we read now of sons that would be born of Jacob,

303
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,479
employing the same approach that Rachel had previously employed,

304
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,779
now being employed by Leah.

305
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:14,179
It tells us in verse number 11 of son number 7,

306
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,679
Leah said, a troop cometh.

307
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,179
She called his name Gad.

308
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,679
Gad means troop.

309
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,179
A troop cometh, that word troop in the beginning of verse number 11,

310
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,879
carries with it the idea, if you look at the Hebrew word of fortune, or good fortune.

311
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,879
And so again, as I made mention throughout the beginning of our message

312
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:38,879
in giving some introductory statements,

313
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:43,879
I believe that through the names of the sons that you can see the fight that's taking place

314
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:47,379
between the sisters.

315
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:52,879
Gad, a troop, but when she says a troop cometh, this fortune or this good fortune,

316
00:31:52,879 --> 00:32:01,379
and no doubt this name was intended as an insult toward Rachel.

317
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,379
It tells us that the second son of Zilpah would be born in verse number 13,

318
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:10,879
his name is Asher, son number 8.

319
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:15,879
We'll end here this evening, but I want you to see in verse number 13 that the Bible says this,

320
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:21,879
and Leah said, happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed.

321
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:25,379
And she called his name Asher.

322
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:34,879
Jacob, son number 8, the daughter, excuse me, the son of Zilpah,

323
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:37,879
his name means happy.

324
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,379
Happy.

325
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,879
She says, happy am I.

326
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:46,879
You know there's a difference between being happy and being blessed.

327
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:55,379
Some have sought to give some explanation between the differences.

328
00:32:55,379 --> 00:33:02,379
I think the greatest definition or example that I've heard is happiness is based on our happenings.

329
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:06,379
But joy and being blessed is based upon Jesus.

330
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,379
My joy is in Him.

331
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:12,379
My praise will be in Him and of Him.

332
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:21,379
And we find this evening that when Asher is born, she says, happy am I.

333
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:26,379
But what was it that would bring Leah a measure of happiness that she refers to?

334
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:32,879
It is this, the daughters will call me blessed.

335
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,879
She called his name Asher.

336
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:41,879
Again, obvious omission in verse number 13 of Genesis 30 is that there's no reference to God.

337
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:43,879
There's no reference to God.

338
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:48,879
She's simply coming to this place and she's now more concerned,

339
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:51,879
not about what God would think, not about God and praising Him,

340
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:58,879
but she's more concerned now with what others would say about her.

341
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,879
The daughters will call me blessed.

342
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:04,879
But I'm going to find happiness in that.

343
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,879
Isn't that sad?

344
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:14,879
And we note here about her condition, about the carnal battle that is taking place,

345
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,879
and it now reaches a pinnacle, if you will,

346
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,879
and it's on full display of what's taking place and the measure of carnality.

347
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,879
And again, we understand the historical context.

348
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,879
We understand the literal interpretation.

349
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,879
I believe that as we look at the Word of God, that it's important for us to draw application.

350
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,879
It's important for us to look at the text of Scripture and say,

351
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,879
listen, God could have simply told us, here are the twelve sons of Jacob.

352
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,879
Could He not?

353
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,879
But He provided all of this detail, some of which I've skipped this evening.

354
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,879
But He provided all of this detail, and we get this view into the life of Jacob and his family

355
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:59,879
and just all the craziness that takes place and the dysfunction that is there.

356
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:04,879
But at the root of so many of those things is the carnality.

357
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:08,879
The carnality.

358
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,879
The battle between Rachel and Leah.

359
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:16,879
The competition between them.

360
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:21,879
Naming their sons.

361
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:26,879
It's meant to be an insult against the sister.

362
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,879
It's a sad condition.

363
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:35,879
And if we're not careful as the people of God, we too can be carnal.

364
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:40,879
We can operate in a realm in which God does not intend for us to operate.

365
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,879
And we can be fleshly.

366
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,879
And we can be carnal.

367
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,879
How many of you know that you have the flesh?

368
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,879
Amen?

369
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,879
We have the flesh.

370
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,879
You know what Paul said about the flesh?

371
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:55,879
He said, I am crucified with Christ.

372
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,879
Why?

373
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:59,879
Because he understood the flesh and the battle that rages.

374
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,879
He says that in Galatians 2 in verse number 20.

375
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,879
You understand that Paul says of the flesh,

376
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:07,879
I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.

377
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:11,879
We read about the conflict where he says the things that I would, I do not.

378
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,879
The things that I would not, that I do.

379
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:19,879
We read in Galatians 5 where the Bible talks about the fact that the spirit and the flesh

380
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:22,879
are in unity one with the other.

381
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,879
And the reality this evening is that if we're not careful in our lives,

382
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:33,879
that we can allow other things, external factors, to impact our walk with God.

383
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:38,879
To cause us to get into the flesh.

384
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,879
You know the devil will use anything to get you into the flesh.

385
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,879
He will.

386
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,879
You know the devil delights in you walking in the flesh

387
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,879
and fulfilling the lust of the flesh.

388
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:56,879
But I'm thankful this evening that God Almighty told us that we can walk in the spirit.

389
00:36:56,879 --> 00:37:00,879
And if we walk in the spirit, we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

390
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:04,879
We're not in competition one with another.

391
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:13,879
It's not that we would go to this extreme and get into this position of carnality and fleshly living.

392
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:14,879
No.

393
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,879
That we come to the place where we keep our eyes on the Lord.

394
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,879
And our journey with the Lord.

395
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:25,879
See, I'm not going to allow external influences to impact my walk with God.

396
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:30,879
I understand that there are challenges that we face.

397
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,879
There are people that will purposefully...

398
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:37,879
You ever felt like somebody was purposefully trying to get you in the flesh?

399
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:40,879
Somebody knew you were a Christian?

400
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:44,879
My dad uses the phraseology, they push my buttons.

401
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,879
My mom says, I didn't think you had buttons.

402
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:51,879
And if they're watching tonight, my dad says, you know what my buttons are.

403
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,879
But the reality is this.

404
00:37:53,879 --> 00:38:00,879
Sometimes it seems like someone is purposefully trying to get us in the flesh.

405
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,879
But we can have victory.

406
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,879
We don't need to go as Leah did.

407
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,879
From that mountaintop.

408
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,879
When Judah is born.

409
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,879
The fourth son.

410
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:18,879
And saying, now will I praise the Lord.

411
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:23,879
It seems to me that in verse number 35 of Genesis 29.

412
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:28,879
She is not concerned whatsoever with what Rachel thinks.

413
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:33,880
With what the daughters would say of her that she references in verse number 13.

414
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:41,880
She is completely fixed upon my praise is going to be of Jehovah.

415
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,880
And in just a period of time that passes.

416
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,880
The behavior of her sister, the carnal fleshly behavior.

417
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Causes Leah to say something like this, two can play this game.

418
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,880
And I'm going to employ the same carnal approach.

419
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Because I haven't handmade as well.

420
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,880
And she ends in verse number 13.

421
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
By calling his name Asher.

422
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,880
And saying, happy am I.

423
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,880
For the daughters will call me blessed.

424
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I hope this evening that we would not be content.

425
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
With just saying, happy am I.

426
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,880
And not be content with what somebody else would say about us.

427
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,880
But that we'd have our attention and our focus fixed upon our God.

428
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
And pleasing Him.

429
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Look at the next four sons next week.

430
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
I'd tell you it's going to be a little bit more brief.

431
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,880
But it probably won't be.

432
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,880
I really believe that as you look at these sons of Jacob.

433
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,880
There is rich truth for us to take away.

434
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
this battle, that bruise, and we can say,

435
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,240
God, help me, help me to walk in the Spirit

436
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
so that I would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

437
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,240
That I'd be in a place where no external force

438
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,240
or influence would cause me to operate at the same level.

439
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,080
I'm gonna just set my affection on things above.

440
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm gonna keep my focus upon my Lord.

441
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's pray.

442
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,180
Father, we love you.

443
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,320
We thank you for loving us.

444
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,940
How blessed we are.

445
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,100
God, we know this evening that as we look

446
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,500
at this passage of Scripture,

447
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,820
that you have preserved for us,

448
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,600
that there's lesson for us.

449
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,080
And I pray that just in some way this evening,

450
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,740
as we've made some application about the conflict

451
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,740
and the carnality, that God, you would help us

452
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,200
to walk in the Spirit.

453
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Help us to trust you, to follow you, to obey you.

454
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,000
I pray that we would be more concerned

455
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,080
with our praise of you

456
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
than we would be of the praise

457
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,900
that we might receive from others.

458
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,140
Lord, I pray that you would take the message tonight

459
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,520
and help us to be able to identify in our lives

460
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,100
when these situations arise.

461
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,260
And that we would be better equipped and prepared

462
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,560
to give no place to the devil,

463
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,680
daily to crucify our flesh and to walk in the Spirit.

464
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,200
Would you move and work in these few moments of invitation

465
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,840
as only you can.

466
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,480
We'll be sure to give you the honor and glory

467
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,680
for each decision that's made,

468
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,000
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

469
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
Would you stand with us?
