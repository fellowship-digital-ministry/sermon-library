1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,779
Corinthians chapter number two.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,800
We're looking through the end of this chapter

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,260
and the first few verses of chapter number three

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,220
this evening.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,779
First Corinthians 2.14 through chapter three

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,579
and verse number three.

7
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:19,579
And this is an ask the pastor message this evening.

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,299
Several questions in fact were submitted

9
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:26,540
that reference some of the social and cultural matters

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,700
that we are facing today.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,240
As believers we know that we are in the world

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,259
but we are not of the world.

13
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,700
And of course this morning the young people,

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,299
four of our teenagers, they sang a great song.

15
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,419
Until then, and then this world is not my home,

16
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,520
I'm just passing through, amen.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,400
And what a blessing and how as they were singing that song

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,799
and I was thinking about the message

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,500
I'd be preaching this evening

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,580
and the fact that we would begin by reminding ourselves

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,259
that this world is not my home.

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,740
And I'm not home but I'm heading home.

23
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,139
We've often said that we're strangers and pilgrims,

24
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,940
read that in Hebrews 11.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,699
We do also know that the Lord is omniscient

26
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:11,260
and in his omniscience he has left us here

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,239
as his representatives.

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,040
It could have been that at the moment of salvation

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,940
we'd immediately be transported to heaven

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,940
and to be with him forevermore.

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,559
But he chose that after salvation,

32
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,400
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature,

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,379
old things are passed away,

34
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,180
behold all things are become new,

35
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:29,860
that's like Corinthians 5.17,

36
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,419
Dean shared that with the promises this evening.

37
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:35,419
But verse number 20 says, and we are his ambassadors.

38
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,819
And so those new creatures,

39
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,379
as we trust Christ as our savior,

40
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:44,379
until we are taken home to our glorious heavenly home,

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,400
we are his representatives, we are his ambassadors

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,500
and we have a mission and we've been given that mission.

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,860
We are sent into the world to be the light of the world.

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,019
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ,

45
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,139
of course, as he's praying there in John chapter number 17,

46
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:05,540
he mentions this very truth with regard to his ministry

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,220
and finishing the work that he'd been sent to do.

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,300
But he says this, I have given them thy word

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
and the world hath hated them

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,699
because they are not of the world

51
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,779
even as I am not of the world.

52
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:20,039
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,

53
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,380
but thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,559
They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.

55
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,259
Sanctify them through thy truth,

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,979
thy word is truth.

57
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,220
And then he says this in verse 18 of John 17,

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,899
as thou hast sent me into the world,

59
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:37,660
even so have I also sent them into the world.

60
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,460
We have been sent into this world.

61
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,820
We find that the believers in Philippi were told this,

62
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,679
that we are to be blameless and harmless,

63
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,820
the sons of God without rebuke

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,419
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation

65
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,220
among whom you shine as lights in the world.

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,100
And so we begin to think about the questions

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,740
that were submitted with regard to some of the things

68
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,399
that we're facing, social and cultural matters

69
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,339
that we're facing today.

70
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,419
We'd understand that many of the things

71
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,380
that we're facing today are the same types of things

72
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,460
that people have been facing for all of humanity.

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,899
And we find that there's certain aspects

74
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,199
where we could say, well, it's never been like this before.

75
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,160
Well, it has actually.

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,179
There have been some very evil times

77
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,979
throughout the history of mankind

78
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,220
and we can read of those in the pages of scripture.

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,779
We can read of those in history books

80
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:31,300
and we can find that we here in this country,

81
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,360
obviously, have understood some things

82
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,639
with regard to the founding of our nation

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,979
and the righteousness, perhaps, as we would refer to it as,

84
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,139
that really laid much of the groundwork

85
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,520
and then we begin to see that turning away

86
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,479
and it's challenging.

87
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,699
In fact, at times in our society

88
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,500
as we're seeking to live in this world,

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
we can become frustrated.

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,259
We can become overwhelmed.

91
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,899
We begin to think about living

92
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,619
in the midst of such craziness

93
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,220
and all of the things that are taking place

94
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,779
and it can overwhelm us.

95
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,020
It can very much frustrate us.

96
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
We begin to think about the day in which we're living

97
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,240
and beginning to think about some of these shifts

98
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,860
that are taking place in our culture

99
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,179
and some of the things that were specifically mentioned

100
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,779
in the questions that were asked.

101
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,600
I thought about this word that I think best describes

102
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,380
the day in which we're living and it's relativism.

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
Relativism.

104
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,059
And here's what the word means.

105
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:29,700
It really, and they refer to it as a doctrine.

106
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,839
Relativism is the doctrine that knowledge,

107
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,260
truth, and morality exist in relation to culture,

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,260
society, or historical context and are not absolute.

109
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,260
That's what relativism says.

110
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,339
And that I think really sums up

111
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,540
the day in which we're living.

112
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,179
Everyone has this idea that it's their perspective,

113
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,700
that it's their truth and my truth

114
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,100
and someone else's truth and all of this relativism

115
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,019
that is so prevalent in our society today

116
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,940
and you notice that it says it's the doctrine

117
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,619
of knowledge, truth, and morality.

118
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,660
And those three things are what specifically

119
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,420
are mentioned in the definition of relativism

120
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,279
and it says that those things only exist

121
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,179
in relation to the culture or the society

122
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,100
or the historical context.

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,420
And that there is no absolute truth.

124
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,579
Now that's a problem for us.

125
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:40,739
As Bible-believing Christians, that is a problem for us.

126
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:41,559
Why?

127
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,059
Because we believe that there's absolute truth.

128
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:49,019
And we believe that as we have this book,

129
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,540
the Bible, the word of God, and we have this

130
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,540
as our standard and that there are absolutes

131
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,140
and we begin to interact with people

132
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,019
that are persuaded of this idea of relativism,

133
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,779
it can become frustrating to us.

134
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,640
It can be overwhelming to us of how do I interact?

135
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,440
How do I answer the questions?

136
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,279
How do I have conversation

137
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,880
and how do I help them understand?

138
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:15,399
Furthermore, we find that when we come to the position

139
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,760
and come to the table with having an idea

140
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,760
that there are absolutes and that we are of the opinion

141
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,839
that the Bible is truth and it stands

142
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,279
and it stands forevermore and that God has given us

143
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,320
this book and we say as Baptist people

144
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
that the word of God, the Bible,

145
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,760
is the sole authority for our faith and practice.

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,239
And when we come to the table with that perspective,

147
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:46,239
we recognize that oftentimes we will be categorized

148
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,959
as being authoritarians.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,880
We may be categorized as being dogmatic or worse.

150
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
And so what do we do in a world

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,559
where we're seeking to follow the teaching

152
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,279
that God has given us?

153
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,519
He's provided us with the Bible.

154
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,720
He's provided us with truth

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,160
and he's left us in this world to be lights.

156
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,480
And we deal with all of the relativism.

157
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,720
We deal with all of the cultural and societal changes

158
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,359
that we're facing and we're dealing with.

159
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:24,239
And we say it's just never been like that in my time.

160
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,500
I hear people say that often.

161
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,279
If my grandmother were to be,

162
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,739
we hear people make those types of references.

163
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,579
Well, guess what?

164
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,880
This is where we are.

165
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,480
And this is the world in which we're living right now.

166
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,320
And so we better understand some things biblically

167
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,119
of how it is that God would use us in this particular time

168
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,640
in order to make a difference.

169
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,839
So often what's happening in the midst of a time

170
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,200
in which the world is changing and all of this relativism,

171
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,040
that churches are folding.

172
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
What do I mean by folding?

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,339
Well, certainly there are churches that are closing down,

174
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,440
but I mean that they're abandoning the truth of God's word.

175
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,839
They're taking positions that are more neutral,

176
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,239
if you will, that are not so dogmatic

177
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,679
and not so authoritarian and not so black and white.

178
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,320
But the reality is that what the world needs is truth.

179
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,640
They need truth because truth will set us free.

180
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,880
See, the Bible talks about the false teachers.

181
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,679
Peter actually deals with it, that they promise liberty,

182
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,119
but they're entangled in bondage themselves.

183
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,960
Wow.

184
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,919
And we find here that as we begin to unpackage this time

185
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,859
in which we're living and try to answer these questions,

186
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:51,880
I've titled the message this evening Spiritual Discernment.

187
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,840
And oh, how we need discernment

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,960
in the day in which we're living.

189
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,679
But really, as I begin to look at the world

190
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,679
in which we're living and I look at this passage

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,880
of Scripture and I think in just six verses of Scripture

192
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,799
that God gives us some clear insight

193
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,679
as to some things that we must understand

194
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,320
as we're going to interact with people in a changing world

195
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,840
where their morality is relative

196
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,400
to whatever they think it should be,

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,400
that their truth changes from one time to another time.

198
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,239
I've mentioned this before.

199
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,880
We've heard the terminology of woke and cancel

200
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,440
and all of those types of things.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
And one of the things that's interesting

202
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,799
is that people that were being canceled

203
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,159
or canceling other people a few weeks ago,

204
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,520
they're being canceled today.

205
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,539
It just, that's the, why?

206
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,719
Because there's no absolute.

207
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,159
And it's a huge problem.

208
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,320
As we look at the text of Scripture,

209
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,559
notice in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14,

210
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,859
the Bible says this.

211
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,760
But the natural man receiveth not

212
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,559
the things of the Spirit of God.

213
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:07,519
are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

214
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,999
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.

215
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:19,099
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?

216
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:22,059
But we have the mind of Christ.

217
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:28,339
Verse 1 of chapter 3, And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but

218
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,579
as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

219
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:37,499
I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it,

220
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:40,579
neither yet now are ye able.

221
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:47,659
For ye are yet carnal, for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions,

222
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:53,019
are ye not carnal, and walk as men.

223
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:59,139
We find that the Apostle Paul introduces a couple of terms in these few verses of Scripture

224
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,939
that are new as far as the church at Corinth is concerned with regard to the written communication

225
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:09,680
that Paul would provide them with under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,579
We find one of them is given to us in verse 14, the natural man.

227
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,019
That's the first reference that we see to this term.

228
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,619
We find also that he mentions in verse 15 about the spiritual, he that is spiritual,

229
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:26,220
and then he speaks of that in verse number 1 of chapter 3, that I could not speak unto

230
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,540
you as unto spiritual, and then this third term, but as unto carnal.

231
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,099
So we see that there are natural, spiritual, and carnal men.

232
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:42,259
I'm going to focus on two of those three this evening and hope to help us as we seek to

233
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:48,579
navigate the times in which we're living and standing upon truth, not abandoning the

234
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:55,459
truth of God's Word, standing firm on what thus saith the Lord, and being able to still

235
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,579
be the light that God has called us to be.

236
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,979
We begin to interact with those that we come into contact with.

237
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:06,899
I think that there are two things that we must really comprehend, and number one is

238
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,020
this, there's a matter of spiritual blindness.

239
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,419
There is a matter of spiritual blindness.

240
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,779
See the Bible tells us in verse number 14, as I've read already, that the natural man

241
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,860
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

242
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
Why?

243
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,819
For they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually

244
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,819
discerned.

245
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:37,380
Those, as we look in verse number 14, we find that the natural man is referring to the unregenerate

246
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,819
man, the unsaved man.

247
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:42,899
That's who's being referred to here in verse number 14 of chapter number 2.

248
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,660
And we find that the Bible says that the Spirit of God, if you look here, it says that the

249
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,459
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

250
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,459
Why?

251
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,860
Well, because the Spirit of God doesn't dwell within them.

252
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,300
And so since the Spirit of God does not dwell within them, then He does not teach them the

253
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,539
Scripture in the same way that He teaches us the Scripture.

254
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:06,300
And so if something amazing took place at salvation, and actually a lot of somethings

255
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,059
that are amazing took place at salvation, that many of us did not understand all of

256
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,500
them on the day that we got saved.

257
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,059
But when you grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and begin

258
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:23,419
to learn more about your salvation, it begins to, man, amaze us as to all that took place

259
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,459
on that day when we trust that Christ is our Savior.

260
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:32,419
And one of the amazing things that took place is the Holy Spirit of God indwelled us.

261
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:37,619
The Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit of God is the divine teacher.

262
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:43,619
In John 16 and verse number 13, the Bible plainly tells us as Jesus is preparing to

263
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:48,139
go to the cross of Calvary and He's giving the disciples some instruction with regard

264
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:52,779
to the days ahead and the ministry that they would have to fulfill.

265
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,220
He says this in verse number 13 of John 16, how be it when He, He's speaking of the Holy

266
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,300
Spirit, He refers to Him as the Spirit of truth.

267
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,339
We understand that He's referred to Him as the Comforter, even within the same context

268
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,279
of this passage with the instruction that He's giving, and He calls Him here the Spirit

269
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,699
of truth.

270
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,859
And He says that when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, notice what it says, He will guide

271
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,220
you into all truth.

272
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,820
For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak, and He

273
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,059
will show you things to come.

274
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,019
I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit of God, who is the author of Scripture, but also He

275
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:39,500
is the teacher of Scripture, and He indwells us.

276
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,260
But when we begin to think about this matter of spiritual blindness in 1 Corinthians chapter

277
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,820
number 2, and we begin to understand that Paul is saying, listen, the natural man receiveth

278
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,540
not the things of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit doesn't dwell within them, and therefore

279
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,260
the Holy Spirit is not teaching them, and here as we look at this truth and this matter

280
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,139
of spiritual blindness, what we must acknowledge this evening is that at times when we begin

281
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,700
to have these conversations with individuals in our society and in our culture that have

282
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:17,739
this completely different worldview, they've followed whole, completely and wholeheartedly

283
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:23,579
this idea of relativism and what have you, then we go to them and we seek to have interaction

284
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:30,660
with them, and our scriptural, spiritual argument is rejected.

285
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,980
Why?

286
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,579
Because it's foolishness to them.

287
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,380
They don't understand it.

288
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:45,859
The things that are contained within this book are spiritually discerned.

289
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:51,739
So when we begin to have a discussion with an individual that is not saved, this matter

290
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,579
of spiritual blindness, they are lost, it's the natural man, the unregenerate man, the

291
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:06,779
unsaved man, we begin to try to give them Bible passages to prove our position, and

292
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,779
then we beat our head against the wall because they don't understand it.

293
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,739
But you know what's amazing?

294
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:20,019
God told us that they wouldn't understand it.

295
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:28,019
The truth is that these that are categorized as being natural men, unsaved, unregenerate

296
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,700
individuals, they need to be saved.

297
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,500
The message for them is the gospel of Jesus Christ.

298
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,220
That is the message that they need.

299
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,779
And we find that in the same text of Scripture in John chapter number 16, when he speaks

300
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:49,980
about how the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit of Truth would come and He would guide us

301
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,419
into all truth, if you look and you notice what's taking place with regard to His ministry

302
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:02,619
amongst the unregenerate, the natural man, it says in John 16 in verse number 8, speaking

303
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:06,980
of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, that when He has come, He will

304
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:15,940
reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.

305
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,179
Of sin, why?

306
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,899
Because they believe not on Me.

307
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:23,579
That's the unbelieving, that's the natural man, that's the unregenerate man, that's the

308
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,139
lost man, the unsaved man, and it says that He's going to the Holy Spirit of God that

309
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:35,940
when He comes that He will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.

310
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,899
Of sin, because they believe not on Me.

311
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:41,940
Of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more.

312
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,139
Of judgment, because the Prince of this world is judged.

313
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:52,279
No doubt, if you've been in our services for any length of time, you've heard me make the

314
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:59,540
statement as I've prayed that the Holy Spirit of God would convict the lost of their sin,

315
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,059
of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come.

316
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,579
That's from John 16, verses 8 through 11.

317
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:15,019
And that is the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God toward this natural man, the unregenerate

318
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,019
man.

319
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,779
I'm not sure if you can remember when you were lost.

320
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:26,139
Some of us, we can remember when we were lost, we got saved later in life, and we can remember

321
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:31,779
when the individuals that we might interact with in that lost condition would try to share

322
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:38,340
biblical truth for us, and it just didn't make any sense.

323
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,500
And then you get saved, and you begin to hear the same Bible verses that maybe you heard

324
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,700
before, and it's like, oh, this makes sense now, because the Holy Spirit of God dwells

325
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,299
within you, and the Holy Spirit of God teaches you.

326
00:18:54,299 --> 00:19:00,179
The Holy Spirit of God convinces you and confirms truth.

327
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,380
And for that, we ought to rejoice and we ought to be thankful, but what happens sometimes

328
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,460
is when we're dealing with those in our culture and our society that are shifting and moving

329
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,219
and they've adopted this philosophy of relativism, and their philosophical ideas are so foreign

330
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:22,619
to what we would believe and what we hold dear, and no, we say there are absolutes.

331
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:29,979
And I got 105 verses that I can give somebody and show them why, but they're lost.

332
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:34,260
They're lost, and they need to be saved.

333
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,820
This matter of spiritual blindness is so important for us as the people of God to understand.

334
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:48,460
In the book of 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, the Bible

335
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:56,739
tells us of what the enemy is doing with regard to keeping people blinded.

336
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,580
2 Corinthians chapter number 4.

337
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,700
The Bible tells us in verse number three

338
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,020
that if our gospel be hid,

339
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,260
it is hid to them that are lost.

340
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,580
By the way, they're the ones that need it.

341
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,780
We sing the song, I love to tell the story.

342
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,220
And as we sing the song,

343
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,700
it talks about one of the verses

344
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,460
of those that have never heard, right?

345
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,800
Because there's so many that have never heard.

346
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,420
I love to tell the story to those that know it.

347
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,480
I mean, listen, we rejoice in knowing it,

348
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,300
but there's a world that's never heard

349
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,260
the wonderful story that Jesus saves.

350
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,740
And if our gospel be hid, it's hid to them that are lost.

351
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,820
Notice what the Bible says in verse number four.

352
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,700
In whom the God of this world, who is that?

353
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,780
That's Satan.

354
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,060
It's a little g.

355
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,660
The God of this world, Satan,

356
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,660
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

357
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,740
Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

358
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,660
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

359
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,600
You know, Satan wants to keep people lost.

360
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,300
He don't want people to get saved.

361
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,180
And so this thing of spiritual blindness

362
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,100
is so important for us to understand.

363
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,300
In John chapter nine, we won't take the time to go there,

364
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,960
but there's a wonderful account of a miracle

365
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,300
that took place of the man that was born blind.

366
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,820
At the end of the text of Scripture,

367
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,260
after all of the interaction with the spiritual,

368
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,980
or excuse me, the religious leaders,

369
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,540
and this man, and his family, and all that takes place,

370
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,940
we find it at the very end

371
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,580
that when they're talking to Jesus, they say this.

372
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,340
Are we blind also?

373
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,680
They were not blind physically

374
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,560
as that man that was healed was blind physically,

375
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,700
but oh, they were blind spiritually.

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
And we find this evening

377
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,020
that this truth of spiritual blindness,

378
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,140
this matter of spiritual blindness is so imperative

379
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,860
for us as the people of God to understand.

380
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,820
We ask questions of how could somebody vote

381
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,700
the way that they vote?

382
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,260
How can they support the things that they support?

383
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,540
How can they stand for the things that they stand for?

384
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,220
Many times the answer is that they're lost.

385
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,520
They're lost.

386
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,620
If a blind person, physically blind person,

387
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,560
were to run their cart into you at Walmart,

388
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,220
you immediately upon being hit with the cart

389
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,980
may stop and be like, oh, did you?

390
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,540
And then you find out that they're blind,

391
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,020
and all of a sudden your interaction

392
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,740
with that person is going to change.

393
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,660
Why?

394
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,260
Because they're blind.

395
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,140
They didn't see you.

396
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,260
And you're going to have a measure of compassion

397
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,160
and understanding that they hit you with their cart

398
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,420
because they could not see.

399
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,140
But yet when it comes to spiritual matters,

400
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,580
it's as if we forget that we're interacting

401
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,120
with people that are lost.

402
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,300
They're unregenerate.

403
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,020
They're unsafe people.

404
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,940
They are referred to as being the natural man,

405
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
and they receive not the things of the Spirit of God.

406
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,780
Why?

407
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,660
Notice what it says.

408
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,900
Not only do they receive not the things

409
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,740
of the Spirit of God,

410
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,380
but it says that they are foolishness unto him.

411
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Neither can he know them.

412
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,300
You know, it's amazing in Albania,

413
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,000
and some of you know some things about Albania.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,380
The Hasaflux are missionaries that we've supported there

415
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,300
for a number of years.

416
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,100
Many years ago upon their original arrival into Albania,

417
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,020
I understand this as I've had interaction

418
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,520
and chatted with Brother Hasaflux over the years,

419
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,820
that basically the people of Albania would say

420
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,500
to be atheist and to be Albanian were kind of synonymous.

421
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,340
I mean, it was their identity.

422
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,900
If you were Albanian, you were an atheist.

423
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,180
It's just the way it was.

424
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,540
And unfortunately that land was just gripped in darkness

425
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,140
and all sorts of things were taking place.

426
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,260
And of course, Brother Hasaflux praised the Lord

427
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,780
for a man that is faithful, that God has used,

428
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,020
and people have been saved.

429
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,500
And it's amazing some of the things that have happened there

430
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,740
and some of the open doors and opportunities.

431
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,980
But it's interesting, he shared with me an account

432
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,040
where there was a professor that he was working with,

433
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,420
and that professor in Albania used the King James Bible

434
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,540
in college classes as an English textbook,

435
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,560
as an English textbook, but said he was an atheist.

436
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,620
This book isn't a textbook.

437
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,720
This book is a living book.

438
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,020
This book is profitable, it's precious.

439
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,020
And we find that the natural man,

440
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,260
he can't understand it, he can't discern it.

441
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,260
And the Bible says because they are spiritually discerned.

442
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,380
So often, and I'm guilty of it,

443
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,220
I hope that you could acknowledge

444
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,980
as you evaluate in your own life,

445
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
perhaps there's times that you're guilty of it as well,

446
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,260
you're having interaction with a lost person

447
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,360
and you're trying to prove your point biblically

448
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,760
and you're giving them Bible verses

449
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
and you're just not understanding

450
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,760
why they're not getting it.

451
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,220
And then we have to step back and say, they're not saved.

452
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,080
They're not saved.

453
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,280
They need the gospel.

454
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,880
And so we find that as we begin to think about interacting

455
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
with those in our culture and our society

456
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,080
and all the shift in worldview that's taking place,

457
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,240
we must recognize this evening

458
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,040
that there's this matter of spiritual blindness.

459
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,140
He continues in verse 15 of chapter two.

460
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,560
It says, but he that is spiritual judgeth all things.

461
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,760
You know that word judgeth and the word discerned

462
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,280
in verse number 14 are the same exact word.

463
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,720
They're used here.

464
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,800
It's the same Greek word.

465
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,520
And so we find that they're certainly appropriate

466
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
translation of what's taking place.

467
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,320
But he says that he that is spiritual judgeth all things.

468
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,140
Yet he himself is judge of no man.

469
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,480
Notice what the Bible says in verse 16.

470
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,720
For who hath known the mind of the Lord

471
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
that he may instruct him.

472
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,480
And then he says, but we have the mind of Christ.

473
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,880
So this is very interesting that he says

474
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
that we have the mind of Christ.

475
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,960
For we find that Paul would then say this

476
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,680
to the believers in Philippi in chapter two

477
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,600
in verse number five.

478
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,120
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

479
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,320
Where do we get the mind of the Lord?

480
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,100
Right here.

481
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
Right here.

482
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,800
This is where we get the mind of the Lord.

483
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,840
And so there are many times that people,

484
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,760
it was a fad that was going on.

485
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,160
And I guess it's different now what they say.

486
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,400
The question is, the fad that was going on,

487
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,280
what would Jesus do?

488
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,440
The WWJD thing that was going on was very popular.

489
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,460
And I guess now there's a spinoff of that

490
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,060
that he would love first is kind of what I understand

491
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,920
from some young people.

492
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,840
I saw some things, I'm like what does that mean?

493
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,020
And they explained it to me because I'm getting old

494
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,040
and don't understand all those things.

495
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,720
You guys ever get text messages with people

496
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,080
putting a whole bunch of letters together

497
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,840
and it's supposed to mean something?

498
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,680
You get those kind of things?

499
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,400
I'm like what in the world?

500
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,240
Anyway, rabbit killed it, we're going back.

501
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,720
And here's the deal though, we have the mind of Christ.

502
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,160
Most people, they ask the question, what would Jesus do?

503
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,840
The problem is that a lot of people have no idea

504
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,280
what Jesus would do because they never have gotten

505
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,440
into this book.

506
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,800
They're running around saying what would Jesus do

507
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,640
but they have no idea.

508
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,380
And so we find this evening that when we're interacting

509
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,560
with people, some of the source of our frustration

510
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,960
and the times in which we become overwhelmed

511
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,400
with trying to get people to understand our perspective,

512
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,680
we are dealing with lost people.

513
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,460
Number two, not only a matter of spiritual blindness

514
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,400
but as we continue into the third chapter

515
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,320
of 1 Corinthians, we find that there's a matter

516
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
of spiritual immaturity.

517
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,980
There's a matter of spiritual immaturity.

518
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,080
So there's a matter of spiritual blindness

519
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,780
but then there's also a matter of spiritual immaturity.

520
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,320
If I were to be transparent this evening,

521
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,520
this one's probably a little harder to deal with.

522
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,600
Why?

523
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,320
Because the person professes to be saved

524
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,480
and they may very well be saved.

525
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,600
I mean, obviously as we're speaking from the context

526
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,080
of the scripture, a spiritual immature person,

527
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,200
a carnal person, they're a saved person.

528
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,120
They're not categorized as being the natural man.

529
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,000
It's a separate category but dealing with that one

530
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
that professes Christ but is spiritually immature,

531
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,440
they are carnal, they've been just influenced

532
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,559
by the world and the culture and the society

533
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,320
and they've bought into all of the things

534
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,880
that the world is saying and they've discounted

535
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,679
the truth of God's word, it's challenging.

536
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,880
Just being very honest and transparent this evening,

537
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,000
it's challenging.

538
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,260
But we find that it is important for us to understand

539
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,840
that when we interact with people,

540
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,720
there will be some that we interact with

541
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,920
that are spiritually blind but there are some

542
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,400
that are spiritually immature.

543
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,520
It says this in verse number one of chapter three.

544
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,600
Notice what Paul is saying.

545
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,840
And I, brethren, he calls them brethren.

546
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,480
I mean, they're saved people.

547
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,239
He says, I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual

548
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,320
but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

549
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,320
I think this is sad, don't you?

550
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,440
I think that Paul is having this heart here

551
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,280
of there's so many things that I wish I could say to you,

552
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,480
that I wish I could give you but I understand

553
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,480
that those things are meat and I have to give you

554
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,200
a milk diet.

555
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
He says that in verse number two.

556
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I have fed you with milk and not with meat.

557
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,239
Why?

558
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:09,499
for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able." And so they

559
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:14,279
were just spiritually immature people. They were not growing as God had

560
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,119
designed it to be that they would be growing in their faith, and they're

561
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,799
spiritually immature. And Paul says that when I came, when I'm writing to you,

562
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,719
when I seek to minister to you, I cannot do it as unto spiritual, but I have to do

563
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:37,719
it as unto carnal, as babes in Christ. He says in verse number three,

564
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:43,879
for ye are yet carnal. And then he describes what that carnality, how it's

565
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:49,279
going to play out. He says, whereas there is among you envying and strife and

566
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:57,279
divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men? The envying, the strife, and the

567
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,799
divisions that were prevalent in the church in Corinth were a direct result

568
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:09,759
to their spiritual immaturity. And that spiritual immaturity, unfortunately, does

569
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:16,719
not allow people to receive the meat of the Word of God. Notice what is said over

570
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:22,199
in Hebrews chapter number five. In Hebrews chapter number five, we find that

571
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:28,839
here the Lord is giving us truth with regard to those that are in the same

572
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:35,559
category as being spiritually immature. And in Hebrews chapter number five, and

573
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:45,199
beginning in verse number 11, notice what the Bible says. Of whom we have many

574
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:50,399
things to say, and hard to be uttered. Why? Why were these things hard to be

575
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:58,039
uttered? Seeing ye are dull of hearing. I don't want to be in that category. He

576
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,839
says this, for when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one

577
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,399
teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God. And it

578
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,679
becomes such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. Now think about this

579
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,399
in verse number 12. Some have asked me this question over the years. When is it

580
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,119
that somebody should be a teacher? I really don't know the answer to the

581
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,639
question, but no doubt under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

582
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:28,279
the human penman to the book of Hebrews knew that it was time that these people

583
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,679
that he's writing to should be teachers. Your spiritual journey and your

584
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,599
spiritual growth is, every single one of us will grow at a different pace, but we

585
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:43,039
ought to be growing. And the writer of Hebrews under the inspiration of the

586
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,839
Holy Spirit of God says, for when for the time ye ought to be teachers,

587
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,519
ye have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the

588
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,679
oracles of God. Now listen, we have to understand this evening that it's not a

589
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,279
problem that a believer needs the milk of the Word. That's where we all

590
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:09,539
begin, on the milk of the Word. The problem is when we ought to be having

591
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:15,979
meat and we're still on a milk diet. That's the problem. And we find here,

592
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:21,079
listen, I'm thankful that I'm not on a milk diet anymore. Aren't you? I mean,

593
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,499
praise the Lord. Can you imagine if all you had was milk? That'd be horrible. I

594
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:30,699
hate milk. I mean, unless it's with cookies or donuts or something, and then

595
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:37,939
it's just double bad. I am thankful physically that I'm not just on a milk

596
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:46,179
diet, but spiritually. God uses that same analogy and illustration for us to

597
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:51,779
understand, listen, there is the meat of the Word. He says this in verse 13, for

598
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,779
everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a

599
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:02,459
babe. Again, we all start with the milk. It's necessary. The Bible says this in

600
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:08,699
1 Peter 2 and verse number 2, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the

601
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:16,299
Word that ye may grow thereby. There's a, when you begin to have

602
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:21,859
discipleship, when you begin to have some teaching of some new believers, you want

603
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:27,179
to start with a good foundation. You want to begin to give them the milk of the

604
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:33,299
Word of God. And why? Because it helps that growth, and it helps them to grow as

605
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:40,339
babes in Christ, to gain that spiritual discernment that they need. Oftentimes

606
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,259
I've had people say to me, I've tried reading the Bible and I just don't

607
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:47,059
understand it, and I don't get this, and I get to this portion of the Bible, and

608
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,099
it seems to be that they always say Leviticus. I'm not sure what's wrong with

609
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,579
Leviticus, but everybody seems to say they get to Leviticus, and they just

610
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:59,539
can't get through. And I try to encourage some new believers, listen, read the book

611
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:06,179
of John. Start in the book of John. I don't send them the first Chronicles. I

612
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:13,539
save that for Blake to read on Christmas Eve. But you understand why we want

613
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:22,699
them to grow, give them some milk of the Word. And we find that here, they

614
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:27,819
then, as they grow, that milk, it says that everyone that useth milk, that

615
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:30,940
everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he's a

616
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,859
babe, but strong meat belonging to them that are full age. Even those who by

617
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:42,139
reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

618
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:50,779
Now this is a very difficult point to really be able to say with absolute, and

619
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,819
that is when is somebody in a position where they're truly a babe in Christ and

620
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,099
growing, and they're on the milk of the Word, and when is somebody spiritually

621
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:03,459
immature? That's gonna vary, and it's not as easy as it is when you deal with the

622
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:09,179
natural man, the spiritual blindness. But the reality this evening is that when we

623
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:13,220
begin to look at this situation in Corinth and look at what's taking place,

624
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,500
and of course if you do any study whatsoever with regard to the the city

625
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:21,380
of Corinth and the wickedness and the culture and all that was taking place,

626
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,739
you will find that no doubt they were living in times in which there was

627
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:34,220
similar types of situations that we deal with even today. They would use the term

628
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:41,619
to describe someone that was living in a wicked, immoral life, whether they were

629
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:46,059
in Corinth or around the region of Corinth, they would refer to the

630
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:51,139
individuals that would be living an immoral life as living like a Corinthian.

631
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:57,339
That's how bad it was in Corinth. And so they're living in that time, and Paul is

632
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:02,779
saying, listen, I have some truth that I want to give you, but you can't get it

633
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:08,099
yet because you're spiritually immature. And there are times when we begin to

634
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,459
deal with the culture in which we're living in, begin to deal with the things

635
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:14,940
in which we're facing, that there are times in which we're dealing with people

636
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,500
that are lost, they're the natural man, there's the matter of spiritual

637
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,859
blindness, but then there are times in which we're dealing with people that are

638
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,019
just spiritually immature. We find that I mentioned already about 1 Peter 2 and

639
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,899
verse number 2, as newborn babes desire, this is the cereal milk of the Word, that you

640
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:33,459
may grow thereby. We find that over in 2 Peter 3 and verse number 18, the

641
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,220
Bible says, but grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus

642
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,619
Christ. And so we understand this evening and we can say with absolute

643
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,739
certainty that it is God's plan and God's design for His children to grow.

644
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:52,179
It is not God's plan or God's design that His children would remain babes in

645
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:57,179
Christ, that we would remain spiritually immature. No, His plan and His desire is

646
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,579
that we would grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus

647
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:06,019
Christ, that He gave us the Bible so that we could grow, that we could have

648
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:11,779
that spiritual discernment, so that we could look at things in our culture and

649
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:15,299
our society, that we could look at the things that we face in our lives and the

650
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:21,779
the things that come our way, and we can have the spiritual ability to process

651
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:27,199
those things and respond to those things. I've often said as I read Psalm 119, what

652
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,179
a wonderful psalm it is, and you think about all that the psalmist says about

653
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:35,260
the Word of God and how wonderful it is and how precious it is and so on and so

654
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:40,380
forth, that our desire ought to be, as the psalmist declares, that we would think

655
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:48,099
and act biblically. It requires that we grow spiritually, and so when we begin to

656
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:54,099
think about and we begin to have these interactions of meeting people and

657
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:00,099
seeking to interact with them, and of no doubt the conversations come up about,

658
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:04,539
hey, did you hear this and did you see that and did you hear about this thing

659
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:08,580
over here, and those conversations no doubt take place in our lives. People

660
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:15,580
bring things up to us. What do you think about? Did you hear about? You get those

661
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,500
kind of conversations, and so what do we do? How do we deal with those people that

662
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,580
we're interacting with when we have a belief that the Bible is the absolute

663
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,500
truth and that this thing of relativism is nonsense because there is absolute

664
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,059
and there is absolute truth, there is right and wrong, there are morals and

665
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,580
immorals, there's a right way to behave and there's a wrong way to behave, and we

666
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,899
find that God has given us His Word and He's outlined those things for us. So

667
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:55,659
what do we do? Well, I believe that as we deal with those, that if we could

668
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:00,260
categorize them as being spiritually blind, we say, let's get back to the

669
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,740
the gospel. Do you know how many times I've had conversations with people trying to, I'm

670
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,780
saying lost people, because I've had conversations with lost people, and I begin to try to give

671
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:17,000
them the gospel, many times, many times they'll ask questions that have absolutely nothing

672
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,620
to do with the gospel. They want you to go over here and talk about this, and they want

673
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,940
to come over here and talk about this, and all of these things that are away from the

674
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:33,340
gospel. And so often what I do is I say something like this, you know what, that is a really

675
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:41,260
good question, and I will answer that, but let's look at this first. Why? Because I want

676
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,420
to get to the point of the gospel because they need to be saved. They're not going to

677
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,780
understand, why do you believe the way that you believe? Well, here's all the verses that,

678
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,980
they're not going to get it. They're the natural man, they receive not the things of the spirit

679
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,180
of God. They're foolishness unto him, neither can he know them. Why? They're spiritually

680
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,620
discerned. And so we need to get back to the gospel, get back to the gospel, get back to

681
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:13,820
the gospel. And we need to be very direct about it. We need to be disciplined. Sometimes

682
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:18,680
what happens if we're not careful is somebody will ask us a question that will distract

683
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,960
us or detour us from really the main point, and we feel like we have to answer that question

684
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,960
so that we don't seem like we don't know. Because we wouldn't want them to think that

685
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,560
we're ignorant to that particular question, or that we're unlearned, or whatever the case

686
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,920
may be. No. So we think we've got to answer all these questions. No, no, no. We have to

687
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,200
be disciplined to stay on track with the gospel. What about those that are spiritually immature?

688
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,600
Well, I've learned, I am learning, maybe I should say, that'd be a better way to put

689
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,840
it. I am learning that it is important that we meet them where they are and then teach

690
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:07,480
them the truth within the pages of this precious book. And we go systematically and we try

691
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,220
to teach them, here's what the Bible says. But listen, before I'm going to take them

692
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,920
and show all them these things about what the Bible says, I must be able to teach them

693
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,700
what the Bible is. Does that make sense? Because before I tell them what the Bible

694
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:29,780
says, I need them to understand what the Bible is. Because if they don't understand what

695
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,540
the Bible is, then it doesn't matter what the Bible says. Because if they don't believe

696
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,880
that the Bible is the authority, that the Bible is God's Word, that the Bible, all Scripture

697
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,020
is given by inspiration of God, if they do not believe that this book is divinely inspired

698
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:55,420
and supernaturally preserved, if they don't have confidence in this book, then I can take

699
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:03,620
them to all the verses of what it says, but it really doesn't help. Why? Because they're

700
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,980
still stuck on what the Bible is. You know how many people think that the Bible is just

701
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:20,180
man's Word? Tons of people. They think that the Bible is man's words. I read an article

702
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:27,780
last week about an individual that used to be a pastor, now is an author, visits churches

703
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:35,460
to try to encourage them. You know what he says about the Bible? He says, the Bible is

704
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:42,720
not the Word of God. The Bible is simply man's words about God. Well, if that's really

705
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,020
the truth, then we just, I mean, what's the point? If it's just man's words about God,

706
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:56,340
then that doesn't do anything for anybody. But we find that this book, see, I have to

707
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,820
start, I have to build a foundation, right? I've never built a house, I'm not going to

708
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,560
build a house, you don't want me to build a house, but I do understand some things about

709
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,400
building a house. If you're going to build a house that's going to stand, you better

710
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,920
spend some time on the foundation. If you don't spend time on the foundation, you're

711
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,940
going to have problems, right? And so therefore, when I begin to deal with somebody that would

712
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,920
fall within this category of being spiritually immature, I do not need to judge them for

713
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,680
their spiritual immaturity, no, rather I'm going to try to teach them. I'm going to meet

714
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,839
them where they are, I'm going to help them to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord

715
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:43,960
and Savior Jesus Christ. Well, that's just your opinion of what the Bible says. That's

716
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,119
just your interpretation of what the Bible says. But again, we must get back to starting,

717
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:56,279
that's why when I have discipleship classes, I always start with the Word of God, always

718
00:44:56,279 --> 00:45:00,680
the foundation. Because everything that we're going to look at as a Baptist, we say the

719
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,680
first point of Baptist distinctives is this, that the Bible is the sole authority for faith

720
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,559
and practice. You know, there's a lot of people, a lot of groups of people that say they believe

721
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,279
the Bible. But they only believe the Bible if it aligns with their experience. They only

722
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:21,680
believe the Bible if it aligns with what a church father said or something else. So they

723
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,040
really don't believe that it's the sole authority for faith and practice. And so therefore,

724
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:35,440
I must begin there with the basics and say, here is what the Bible is. And then when I

725
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:46,040
can get somebody to agree that the Bible is inspired and preserved and profitable and

726
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,360
all that the Bible is, then I can say something like this, can we agree that we are going

727
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:58,960
to agree with God? We're going to go to God and His Word and we're going to see what God's

728
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:07,119
Word says. And if we can agree that this is God's Word and it's inspired and it's preserved

729
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:16,480
and this is the standard, we can get somewhere. But if we don't have that foundation, you

730
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:26,040
can beat your head upon the wall. I've been there. I have. I'm just telling you. And seemingly

731
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,119
get nowhere. Why? Well, because they really didn't believe that this book is what you

732
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:40,440
believe this book is. And so you're talking on two different wavelengths. Does that make

733
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,600
sense? Because I have a belief of what this book is and so therefore when I turn to a

734
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,640
verse of Scripture and say, bam, that's what the Bible says, then I'm thinking they're

735
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,440
at the same place I am with regard to what they believe the Bible is. And then all of

736
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,480
a sudden I find out they don't really believe the Bible is what I believe the Bible is.

737
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:07,200
And so we can avoid a lot of frustration. We can avoid a lot of difficulties in our

738
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,820
own lives as we have these types of conversations when we acknowledge that there's a matter

739
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:19,760
of spiritual blindness and there's a matter of spiritual immaturity. And I'm going to

740
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,580
seek as I interact with those individuals to be able to meet them where they are and

741
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:35,500
give them what they need. Paul said, I have some things I wanted to tell you, but I can't

742
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,779
because you're not spiritual, you're carnal. Basically that's what he says in 1 Corinthians

743
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:48,180
chapter number 3 verses 1-3. And so we find that he says there in Hebrews 5, there's some

744
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,779
things that I want to tell you. They're hard to be uttered. Why? Because you're dull of

745
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:56,220
hearing. Because in the time that you ought to be teachers, you're actually having need

746
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,779
that somebody teach you. And so we find that there was an understanding on the part of

747
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:06,420
the spiritual leader of the person that had a certain amount of spiritual awareness and

748
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,180
a spiritual discernment to know, here's how I need to approach this particular subject,

749
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:19,940
this particular matter. See, it's really not unlike other fields of life. If you're going

750
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,700
to teach somebody how to do certain things, whether you're going to teach them how to

751
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,140
put up drywall, you're going to teach them how to paint, you're going to teach them how

752
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,420
to lay carpet, you're going to teach them how to lay tile, you're going to teach them

753
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:38,260
how to play the piano, you've got to start where they are. Right? I come to Holly and

754
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,140
I say, teach me the piano. I want to play a hymn next Sunday for a special. I'm ready

755
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:52,619
to go. It ain't going to work. That's not where I am. So she's going to have to take

756
00:48:52,619 --> 00:49:00,299
me to the, like, level one book. Is there something below level one? Just one hand at

757
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:07,179
a time, just a few notes, maybe the letters of the keys on the notes, because I don't

758
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:15,299
know what, do you understand what I'm saying? Why? Because that's where I am. And that's

759
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:21,859
where she would have to have the discernment as a teacher of, I'm not ready to put this

760
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:32,580
piece of music in front of you because you're not able to do it. And so this evening, we

761
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,660
can avoid a lot of frustration and a lot of difficulty in our lives when we interact with

762
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,299
people. We get so frustrated. Why don't they see it like we see it? Well, it might be because

763
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:52,179
they're spiritually blind. They need Jesus. They need to be saved. It may be because they're

764
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:58,900
spiritually immature. They might be saved, but maybe no one's ever taken and taught them

765
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,260
the truth of God's Word.

766
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:06,580
Maybe no one has taken the time to invest in them and give them some discipleship and

767
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:12,020
teach them, and we just have an expectation in our mind that, well, they've been around

768
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,620
for a little while, I mean, they know a lot of these things, whatever, and so they must

769
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,140
be at this level, and then we find out, no, they're really not.

770
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,980
But it's not that we would insult them or criticize them, it's that we would seek to

771
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:31,020
help them to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

772
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:39,500
I think about that truth in Acts 8, the Ethiopian eunuch is standing there, or sitting there

773
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,740
up in the chariot, and he's reading from Isaiah 53, you're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

774
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,780
God takes Philip and brings Philip over to him and says, go up to the chariot.

775
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,420
You know what Philip asks that man?

776
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:59,060
He says this, he said, understandest thou what thou readest?

777
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,980
And his response is so important for us to understand.

778
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:12,420
He says this, how can I except some man teach me, guide me?

779
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,780
Wow, what a great truth.

780
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,100
And so you know what Philip did?

781
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,620
He got up in the chariot and he preached Jesus.

782
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,300
Because you know what the Ethiopian eunuch, he said, man, is this guy talking about himself,

783
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,760
the prophet Isaiah, or is he talking about some other man?

784
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,660
He's reading Isaiah 53, he's talking about Jesus.

785
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,540
And so what does the Ethiopian eunuch need to understand?

786
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,840
He needs to understand Jesus.

787
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:44,460
So Philip gets in and he preaches Jesus, and then he sees water and says, can I get baptized?

788
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,460
If you believe, thou mayest.

789
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,460
What do you do?

790
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:52,780
He said, I believe that Jesus is the Christ.

791
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,860
Stop the chariot, baptize them.

792
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,380
It's awesome.

793
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:03,900
But never forget that he said, how can I except some man should teach me?

794
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,820
There's some people that we interact with that they just need somebody to teach them.

795
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,900
First what this book is, then what this book says.

796
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
Let's pray.

797
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Father, we love you.

798
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
We thank you for loving us.

799
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,900
We thank you for your Word.

800
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,260
We pray, God, that you would help us to be students of the Word.

801
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,640
I pray that you'd help us to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus

802
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
Christ.

803
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,340
I pray, God, that you would help us as we interact with those in our culture, so many

804
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:41,640
that have adopted this worldview and philosophy that is counter-biblical, this idea of relativism

805
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,900
that is so prevalent.

806
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,540
And God, I pray that you would help us to stand upon the truth of thy Word.

807
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:52,340
I pray that you'd help us to have the right position and also the right disposition, help

808
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:59,380
us to understand that people need Jesus, they need to be saved, and help us to understand

809
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,460
the importance of growth, spiritual growth and development.

810
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,820
I pray, Lord, that you would help us ourselves to be students of the Word.

811
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,980
Help us, Lord, to be used for your honor and for your glory.

812
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,100
And I pray that you'd bless as we have this time of invitation, we ask that decisions

813
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,500
would be made that would please thee, and we'll thank you for it, in Christ's name we

814
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,500
pray.

815
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:19,500
