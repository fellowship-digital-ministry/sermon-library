1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
We're going to be looking at verses 5 through 11 this morning, 1 Timothy 1,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,719
verses 5 through 11. I'm thankful for God's Word, aren't you?

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,199
And what a blessing to have the Bible and so thankful for

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,640
the content and for the instruction that God gives us. We understand that all

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,040
Scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,479
for what? For doctrine is the first thing that's mentioned in 2 Timothy 3

7
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,159
and verse 16 when you look at that verse of Scripture.

8
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:31,079
And so thankful for God's Word, the teaching of God's Word.

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,240
We look at this portion of Scripture in 1 Timothy 1.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,799
We'll be looking this morning at verses 5 through 11. Last week as we looked at the

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:38,720
beginning

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,959
of this portion of Scripture, we concluded

13
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:46,520
that we have each been equipped for the task of continuing. We know, we

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,279
understand this morning

15
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:52,080
as we'll study throughout this calendar year, the charge that is received that we

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,200
continue.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,959
And I said this last week, it's not enough to just understand the charge,

18
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:00,479
it's not even enough to accept the challenge, the call to continue.

19
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,599
We must be equipped to continue. I'm thankful that God's given us all that we

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,360
need

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,680
and we understand that His

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,760
equipping of His saints and what a blessing to understand this morning

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,400
that He's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,519
and we dealt with His provision for us and what He provides us with, but

25
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,919
also the plan

26
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:28,319
that He has for each of us and as we are mindful of God's plan for us, even as we

27
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,000
noted

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,480
the plan that God had for Timothy, the plan that God had for Paul,

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,160
that God also has a plan for us and that enables us to continue

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,239
and what a blessing. As we move through the text of Scripture,

31
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,400
we note the importance of doctrine and we receive instruction for how we are to

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
continue

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,319
and we understand as we look here and we look to

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,559
the Scriptures, there's a right way and there's a wrong way. I believe this

35
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:55,760
morning that we must strive to continue

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,839
in the right doctrine, thus pleasing

37
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:02,440
the Lord. In verse number five, the Bible says, Now the end of the commandment is

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,160
charity out of a pure heart,

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,000
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, from which some, having swerved, have

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,600
turned aside unto vain jangling,

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,080
whereof they affirm.

43
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,800
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,080
knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
and disobedient,

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,919
for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of

47
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,639
fathers and murderers of mothers,

48
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,960
for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind,

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,479
for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons,

50
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,279
and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.

51
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,839
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,

52
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,880
which was committed to my trust.

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,960
As we look here, and again as I made the statement already, we must strive to

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
continue in the right direction,

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,119
thus pleasing the Lord, and as we continue, we must acknowledge the

56
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,679
biblical truth

57
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,720
that doctrine matters. That doctrine matters.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Making good time going in the wrong direction

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,479
is no good. Amen? You say, man, I'm making great time, but you're going the wrong way.

60
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,800
No one cares. It's not, you're not going to, you're just going to reach the wrong

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
destination sooner.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,160
And so we find this morning that doctrine matters. That's the title for the message.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,639
I will not take the time this morning to look at all the verses in 1st and

64
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,800
2nd Timothy.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,880
There are twelve verses within these chapters of Scripture, ten chapters,

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,360
that reference in some way doctrine.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,639
And using the word specifically, and we'll study through those as we get

68
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,279
through the calendar year

69
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:49,399
as we come to each of those portions of Scripture. But what I want you to do this

70
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:52,559
morning by way of introduction is hold your place here in 1st Timothy, but turn on the

71
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,279
book of Titus, if you will,

72
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,679
and just so that we can understand and kind of wrap our minds around this

73
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,399
thought as we enter into the message this morning

74
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:05,839
that doctrine matters. Again, we live in a time, I mentioned this last week,

75
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:09,119
that the society in which we're living,

76
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:13,520
they're becoming less and less concerned about doctrine. If you

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,119
think about Christendom,

78
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:19,920
very broadly speaking, and Christianity, people will use that terminology.

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,119
And there are many that are saying, don't worry about doctrine.

80
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:28,880
Don't let doctrine divide. Well, doctrine will divide. Doctrine matters.

81
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,559
And as we look at the Scriptures, we find in one reference before we look

82
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,480
here in Titus,

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,279
that we understand that Paul had told Timothy

84
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,480
that the time will come when they will not endure

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,160
sound doctrine. So therefore, change your message to accommodate them so that

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
they'll keep coming.

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,079
Is that what Paul told Timothy? No, that's not what Paul told Timothy.

88
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,679
Paul told Timothy, preach the word. Be instant in season, out of season. Reprove,

89
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,880
rebuke, exhort

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,799
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

91
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,880
And then he tells them, but they're not going to endure sound doctrine.

92
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,119
But it doesn't change the charge to continue to preach the word and to

93
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,359
preach doctrine.

94
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:13,440
Why? Because doctrine matters. In the book of Titus,

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,760
Paul is writing to Titus, again,

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,239
another that he would refer to as his son of the faith, a man

97
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,519
that he was investing in, understanding the course that he would run, just as

98
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,160
he's invested in Timothy.

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,959
But I want you to notice, in Titus 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this,

100
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,839
for this cause left I thee in Crete.

101
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,040
And so we find, just like he gave the charge to Timothy in 1 Timothy

102
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,559
chapter 1 that we looked at last week with what

103
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:44,119
Paul's charge was to him to, as Paul was going to leave to go to Macedonia, that

104
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,640
he stays in Ephesus, remember,

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
that he charged them not to teach anything that's contrary to the doctrine,

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,040
and he left him there for that purpose. Remember, as we look back at Acts 20 last

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,600
week,

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,720
Paul knew that after his departure there would be some grievous wolves that would

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,119
come in, not sparing the flock of God.

110
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,760
He also knew of their own selves there would be men that would rise up.

111
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,640
And so Paul, God gave Paul the direction, God in his infinite wisdom

112
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,600
says, Timothy is going to stay here, and he's going to help preserve this doctrine,

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,799
this teaching,

114
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:22,679
that I want to be preserved. Well, for Titus here, Paul says, for this cause left

115
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,040
I thee in Crete,

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,480
that thou shouldest set in order things that are wanting. There were some

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
problems.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,239
And he says, and ordain elders in every city

119
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:37,839
as I had appointed thee. So we see the responsibility of Titus,

120
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,959
but then I want you to notice in the next few verses, as we kind of pick our

121
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,200
way through here by way of introduction,

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,000
the emphasis even here on doctrine. In verse number 9 of Titus 1,

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,359
the Bible says, speaking about these qualifications for those that he would

124
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,760
set in order,

125
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,720
ordaining these elders in every city, it says in verse 9,

126
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,399
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught,

127
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,559
that he may be able, notice, by sound

128
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,640
doctrine, both to exhort and to convince

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,760
the gainsayers. Why? For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,

130
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,440
especially they of the circumcision. We know that when he uses that terminology,

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,000
the circumcision, he's speaking about Jews,

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,079
and we find that he's saying, listen, there's going to be some people that are coming in

133
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,079
with some false teaching. Guess what? We're going to deal with that in 1st Timothy

134
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,320
this morning as well.

135
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,160
And we find that he talks about being sound in doctrine,

136
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,480
that they're holding fast the faithful word

137
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,519
as he hath been taught. In verse number 13, this witness is true,

138
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,720
wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,600
in the faith. Verse 16, they profess that they know God,

140
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,000
but in works they deny Him. Being abominable

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,239
and disobedient and unto every good

142
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:02,600
work reprobate, but speak, chapter 2 and verse number 1,

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,679
thou the things which become

144
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:12,119
sound doctrine. We find that as soon as the church is established

145
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:15,640
and the church is moving forward for the cause of Christ,

146
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,720
we understand that there are false teachers that would show up on the scene.

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,839
The reality is that those false teachers were there then, and they continue to be

148
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,679
here still to this day.

149
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:30,320
And we find that as we look back in 1st Timothy chapter number 1 and begin to

150
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,799
dissect this portion of scripture this morning,

151
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,840
notice with me first of all the exposure

152
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,840
of false teachers. I'm thankful that God is able to expose false teaching.

153
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm thankful that He has given us His word so that we too might be able to

154
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
expose false teaching.

155
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Not everything that you listen, not every eloquent speaker, because of their

156
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:54,599
eloquence means that what they're saying is true.

157
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:58,760
Amen? There are some people, listen, not the person that has the most follows,

158
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,000
the most likes, the most people that are

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,039
going and liking their post and following them, it doesn't mean that

160
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,479
they're right.

161
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,840
Amen? How do we determine what's right and what's wrong?

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,960
Right here, the Bible. He says in 1st John that we're to try the

163
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,440
spirits.

164
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,000
Amen? We understand, and we'll mention at the end of the message this morning in

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,320
Jude, that we're to earnestly contend

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,000
for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints, and we find the exposure

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
of false teachers here in this portion of scripture. Notice in verse number 6

168
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,799
where He begins to introduce us to these false teachers, He's already spoken

169
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,679
about the

170
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,359
call that He gave Him, that He would charge some, according to verse number 3,

171
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,200
that they teach no other doctrine,

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,520
neither would they give heed to fables and endless genealogies. But in verse

173
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
number 6,

174
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,760
notice He says,

175
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,719
from which some,

176
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,599
having, do you see that word swerved?

177
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,960
It's kind of an interesting word. It says that from some having swerved have turned

178
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:08,760
aside unto vain jangling." As God is giving His Word here and as Paul is speaking to Timothy,

179
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,840
we find that he is exposing these false teachers, their exposure is noted, where they are being

180
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,920
exposed for their false teaching. He says that these are described as being those that

181
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,480
have swerved. It means to deviate from, it means to miss the mark. In my mind, it really

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,620
has the exact opposite of continue. They've swerved. They've turned aside. They've deviated

183
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:42,240
from the path that has been established and they've swerved. The Bible tells us that they've

184
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,060
swerved and notice they've turned aside unto vain jangling. That's kind of interesting

185
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,840
phraseology, isn't it? You know what it means? Useless talk. Useless talk. You ever listen

186
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,280
to somebody that talks for a long time and they don't really say anything? You know what

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,360
I mean? You hear somebody give a presentation, a speech, and you're kind of like, what in

188
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,920
the world? There's no real meat to the message. And here he talks about this vain jangling,

189
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,440
this useless talk, and really when we look at verse number 6 and see how these false

190
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,240
teachers are being exposed and we see that they have swerved, they've deviated from the

191
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,000
path, they've missed the mark, they've turned to vain jangling, this useless talk, we find

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,920
that really what's happening in verse number 4, which we studied last week, it gives us

193
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,280
some insight into this useless talk. It was that they were dealing with these fables and

194
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,880
these endless genealogies and you know what the result was? The result was questions,

195
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,560
not godly edifying. And we see that in verse number 4. And so we find that as we look here

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,800
and we see how these false teachers are being exposed, that Paul says they've swerved, they've

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,920
turned to vain jangling. But then as we come to verse number 7, we see that these false

198
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,040
teachers, they're really not qualified. Notice the Bible says, desiring to be teachers of

199
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,800
the law. Now if we just stopped right there, we'd say that's a commendable desire, to be

200
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,880
a teacher of the law. That's a commendable desire, but notice what Paul says, understanding

201
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:26,180
neither what they say nor whereof they affirm. So they have a desire but they're not qualified.

202
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,900
They simply don't know what they're talking about, if we could put it in very basic English

203
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,160
this morning. And so we find that here, as Paul is saying that they're not qualified,

204
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,000
it's very interesting when we look at how these false teachers are being exposed in

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,200
the first chapter, that later on, a couple of chapters later in chapter 3, and we'll

206
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,480
look at it in great detail as we move through the book, but turn over just for a moment

207
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
to chapter 3, and notice what the Bible says in verse number 1 of chapter number 3 of this

208
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,760
book. This is a true saying. If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,480
work. And so we see here that thought of desire, we see it in verse number 7 of chapter 1,

210
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,520
these that were false teachers, they had a desire to teach the law, but they weren't

211
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,240
qualified, and so we find that in chapter number 3, God gives a list of qualifications

212
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,640
for those that would desire the office of a bishop. You know one of them at the end

213
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:32,080
of verse number 2? Apt to teach. Apt to teach. In chapter number 1 in verse number 7, he

214
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,480
says they desire to be teachers of the law, but they understand neither what they say

215
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,080
nor whereof they affirm. In the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary, one of the definitions

216
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:54,560
that is given for the word apt is qualified or fit. And so we find that these false teachers

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,280
that are being mentioned here, that are being exposed in this portion of Scripture, in the

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,640
very introduction to this letter, we find that these false teachers are being exposed

219
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,920
and God is giving instruction to Timothy on how to deal with this. We'll look at it in

220
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,760
just a moment. But we understand the way that these folks, they've swerved, they've turned

221
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:22,080
to vain jangling, they're not qualified. What are they doing? Well, they did not properly

222
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,600
understand or apply the Old Testament law. Really, as we look at the text of Scripture,

223
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,960
we see exactly that's what's being dealt with. And they did not properly understand

224
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:38,200
it, nor did they properly apply the Old Testament law. In fact, in Acts chapter 15, if you were

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,080
to look there in that portion of Scripture and see the council at Jerusalem and what's

226
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,320
taking place, in Acts 15.1, there were people that were coming, these Judaizers, and they

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,840
were saying, except a man be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

228
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,400
Now Paul, he was having none of that. No, no, no. That is not true. And there was a

229
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,280
big conversation, a council that's recorded for us in Acts 15 in Jerusalem of all that

230
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,280
took place with that. And you know what they concluded? That they're saved just like we're

231
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,680
saved by grace through faith because it's the blood of Jesus Christ, His death barrel

232
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,760
and glorious resurrection that allows for a man, woman, boy, girl to be saved. Amen?

233
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,140
Has nothing to do with circumcision, has nothing to do with baptism, has nothing to

234
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:35,640
do with any other religious rite or ritual. It's through the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen?

235
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,000
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture that they did not notice understanding

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,120
in verse number 7, neither what they say nor whereof they affirm. Paul then immediately

237
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,640
gets into the subject of the law. Why would Paul deal with the subject of the law? Well,

238
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,960
that's because that's where they've erred. That's where they've gone astray. That's where

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,160
they've swore from. That's where they've turned to vain jangling. And we find that Paul is

240
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,120
going to set the record straight. He's going to help them to understand the sound doctrine.

241
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,640
And so we see that they did not properly understand. We find that their teaching, as I mentioned

242
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,240
a moment ago, it resulted in questions, not in godly edifying.

243
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,200
Now understand this morning that it's certainly appropriate and applicable that even still

244
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,880
today that teaching may result in questions, but those questions can be answered by God's

245
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:39,640
Word. The idea of what's being given here in verse number 4 about these false teachers

246
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,320
that it generates these questions which minister questions is that it just leaves people at

247
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,680
a dead end. You know, a lot of religion today leaves people at a dead end. They're confused.

248
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:01,480
No hope, no peace, no direction, confusion. By the way, who's the author of confusion?

249
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Not my God. Satan is the author of confusion. And we find that, I'm thankful, listen, we

250
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,480
say it often, that the Bible has the answer. Aren't you thankful for that? I was reading

251
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,840
this morning the book of Numbers. Somebody shared with me a testimony about reading Leviticus.

252
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,560
I just finished Leviticus just a couple of days ago. Man, I love the book of Leviticus.

253
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,200
I know so many people say, man, the book of Leviticus. Man, it is a great book that really

254
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,480
shows the work and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and His offering that He made for us.

255
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,400
I mean, it's a precious book. But I was in the book of Numbers this morning and there's

256
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,280
a unique thing that happened in the life and ministry of Moses. There was a circumstance

257
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,240
that came up that had not been given direction from God yet. You know what Moses did? He

258
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,600
said, hold on, let me go ask God. And he went to the Lord and guess what God did? He gave

259
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,640
him an answer. Praise God. We have a Bible. God's given us this book. And in this book,

260
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,260
the Bible, we often sing the B-I-B-L-E. Yes, that's the book for me. And I'm thankful that

261
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,040
our doctrine is based on the Bible, the Bible teaching. And we go to the Bible. We have

262
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,080
a question. We say, Lord, you've given us this book. Provide us with the answer. Help

263
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,880
us to have an understanding. Illumine the scriptures to us so that we might understand

264
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,920
what you desire, what your plan is. And we go to the Bible and we understand that God's

265
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,600
given us principles. And those principles are applicable in life. And we see that what

266
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,360
was happening with these false teachers is that it was leaving them, those followers

267
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,160
at this dead end, these questions that could not be answered, no hope and no peace. And

268
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,240
Paul is exposing, God is exposing the false teachers. Now, here's something for us to

269
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,040
be mindful of this morning, that false teachers were present and active in the beginning of

270
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:56,040
the church and they're present and active in this day of the church age. We find that

271
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,200
the scriptures say this, Paul exposes false teaching. God uses Paul to expose false teaching.

272
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,520
God uses Peter to expose false teaching. Of course, there's a number of other portions

273
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,160
of scripture that we could go to, but each of them have portions of scripture in their

274
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,480
books that deal with the characteristics of false teaching. Jude deals with it as well,

275
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
but you see, you can just go through those characteristics. But Peter says this, he says,

276
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,480
as there were false prophets, even so there will be false teachers. Now, understand what

277
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,240
Peter is communicating there as he says that. The people of God could understand, you and

278
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,600
I this morning can understand as we go to the Old Testament and read the Old Testament

279
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,119
that there are many references that God has recorded for us of false prophets that existed

280
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,880
in the Old Testament. And so Peter says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

281
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:55,040
just as there were false prophets then, there will be false teachers today. So God's Word

282
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,880
exposes false teaching. And I'm thankful for that.

283
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,160
When we look here at this portion of Scripture, we find not only the exposure of false teaching,

284
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,920
but number two, we find the emphasis on sound doctrine.

285
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
The emphasis on sound doctrine.

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I mentioned already that these false teachers were mishandling the law, and therefore, what

287
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
does Paul do?

288
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
He addresses the law.

289
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,560
Notice in verse number eight, as we continue, we'll get to verse number five at the end

290
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,420
of the message, but notice in verse number eight, the Bible says, but we know.

291
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,700
Now that's a level of confidence, is it not?

292
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,240
He says, we don't think, he's not saying, no, we know that the law is good.

293
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,160
If a man use it lawfully, do you know what that word lawfully means?

294
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,360
It means properly.

295
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
It means properly.

296
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,360
So what was happening with the false teachers, I mentioned that they did not properly understand

297
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
or apply the Old Testament law.

298
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,260
We can talk about the idea of legalism, and we can talk about the idea of obtaining some

299
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:09,860
level of grace and favor, merit from God because of this outward obedience to the law.

300
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,800
That's not the purpose of the law.

301
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,900
That's not properly understanding or applying the law, and we find, we'll end ourselves

302
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,780
in the book of Galatians at some point this morning, but we find that he says that the

303
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,860
law is good, but it must be used lawfully, properly.

304
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,640
This in verse number 10, we'll go back to verse nine in just a moment.

305
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,720
At the end of verse number 10, it says, and if there be any other thing that is contrary

306
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
to sound doctrine.

307
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,200
Now as we look at the word lawfully in verse number eight, we see that that means properly.

308
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,040
As we come to verse number 10, and we see the phrase of sound doctrine, the word sound

309
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,400
means to be healthy.

310
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:57,800
It means this, to be free from any mixture of error, to be free from any mixture of error.

311
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,900
You know, one of the things and one of the reasons that we're going to have in our Sunday

312
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,000
school class for the next several weeks, a study on why we use the King James Bible,

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,279
you understand why, how the enemy is seeking to introduce error, to mix truth with error

314
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,559
is through so many of the modern translations.

315
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,559
So many of the modern translations today, all of a sudden there's this mixture of error,

316
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,380
there's this confusion, there's this contradiction that you'll find in a number of these new

317
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,720
modern translations, and we're just going to go ahead and study through a bunch of them

318
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
and just let it be said, here's what these modern translations say, and here's where

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,040
they're wrong, and here's how it changes doctrine.

320
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,380
Doctrine matters.

321
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,720
The enemy is behind that, for the enemy is the one in Genesis chapter number three that

322
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,760
said, yea, hath God said, ye shall not surely die, no, in the day that ye eat thereof you'll

323
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,639
be like gods.

324
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:58,680
That's what Satan said in Genesis three.

325
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,900
By the way, he's a liar, he's the father of it, amen?

326
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:11,600
We find here that as Paul would use these words, every word of God is pure, God gave

327
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:19,320
him these words lawfully to have a proper understanding and application of the law.

328
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,300
Sound doctrine, that which is healthy, that which is free from any mixture of error, obviously

329
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:31,040
when you look at the teaching of these false teachers, it's nothing, it's not sound.

330
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,840
It's infiltrated with error, it's diseased, if you will, if we could look at the use of

331
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,320
that word sound and looking at the contradiction between that which is appropriate and to be

332
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,240
taught versus that which these false teachers were teaching, and so when we look at the

333
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,720
emphasis on sound doctrine, let me say this, proper interpretation and application of Scripture

334
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,160
is absolutely essential.

335
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,600
Proper interpretation and application of Scripture.

336
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:08,040
Peter says in 2 Peter 1 verse 20 and 21 that no prophecy is of any private interpretation.

337
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,440
So often, and I'm going to make a number of statements here with regard to proper interpretation

338
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,860
and application of Scripture, we talk about the interpretation of Scripture, a theological

339
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,480
word that's used as hermeneutics, right, the hermeneutical approach to interpreting Scripture,

340
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,980
hermeneutics, and we find here that when we deal with the proper interpretation and application

341
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,760
of Scripture, the context is key.

342
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,720
You know how a lot of false teachings have been raised?

343
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,600
Through taking Scripture out of context.

344
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,119
You take one verse of Scripture and you just remove it from its context and you build some

345
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:49,559
teaching on this singular verse of Scripture, giving no mind to the context in which that

346
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,559
truth was given.

347
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,360
It's a very dangerous thing.

348
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,540
Every once in a while I'll preach a topical message.

349
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,260
Exegetical messages are enjoyable to preach, no doubt.

350
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,480
Primarily I preach exegetical messages.

351
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,640
I like to preach within the context of what the Scriptures…

352
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,739
I love preaching through books of the Bible.

353
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:15,179
If you've been here since I've been here, I don't know, there's like 24, 26 books

354
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:19,500
of the Bible that I have preached or taught through in the 12 years that I've been here,

355
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,660
and we go verse by verse through those books of Scripture, and that helps…

356
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,100
What is it saying in the Old Testament?

357
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,580
Line upon line, precept upon precept.

358
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:36,660
And so many false teachings have been made just so available to people by taking a verse

359
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,860
out of context.

360
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,420
Let me say this, there must be an understanding of whether the verse of Scripture is to be

361
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,739
interpreted literally or figuratively.

362
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:53,020
We must be careful not to over-spiritualize or under-spiritualize.

363
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,179
We must keep it within context, and sometimes there's literal, sometimes there's figurative.

364
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:59,179
We understand that.

365
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,420
When we talk about some of the figurative, we'd understand some of these manners of

366
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,820
writing.

367
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
And the Bible…

368
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,739
Listen, there are times in which the Bible uses metaphors.

369
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,619
There are times in which the Bible uses allegories.

370
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:19,260
In fact, Paul says in Galatians, this is an allegory, right?

371
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,059
He's giving us an understanding of a passage of Scripture in the book of Genesis when he

372
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:29,100
refers to it as being an allegory, so metaphors, allegories, similes.

373
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,820
We think about parables.

374
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,420
Jesus often taught with parables, right?

375
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,660
And so we have to understand that as we take and look at the Scriptures and we desire to

376
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:46,459
understand that doctrine matters, that when we build our faith, our doctrine, our teaching,

377
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:52,059
that proper interpretation and application of Scripture is key.

378
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:56,820
As you look in this portion of Scripture, Timothy is being given this charge.

379
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,300
He's received the charge already in verse number three, as I besought thee.

380
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,000
This is something that happened before, and now Paul is writing back to him.

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,619
As you would understand the way in which this is being given to Timothy, Paul had given

382
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,619
him this charge.

383
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,940
He says, as I besought thee to abide.

384
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,860
And as Timothy had this responsibility, the understanding God's plan for his life, it

385
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,020
began to get hard, because there's false teachers.

386
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,260
You know what's interesting?

387
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,700
It seems as if a lot of false teachers can get a great following of people.

388
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,619
You ever notice that?

389
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,940
They wax eloquent, they say all these things, and man, all of a sudden people just start

390
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
following me.

391
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,980
You're like, hey, what in the world?

392
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,660
At one point, I don't know that it's true any longer, I've not seen statistics on this

393
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,140
for probably at least a decade, but statistics a couple of decades ago would indicate that

394
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:57,100
a number of cults in America, that one of the number one quote-unquote convert that

395
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,619
they received was from Baptist churches.

396
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,899
You say, what in the world?

397
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,700
How does somebody that's sitting in a Baptist church hearing the teaching of God's word,

398
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,940
if it's being done appropriately, if the pastor is teaching and preaching and placing the

399
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,739
emphasis on sound doctrine, how does a cult member show up at your door or my door and

400
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:20,220
get me to turn my back on what God says and follow them?

401
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,940
But you see the evidence of it.

402
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,540
Timothy is in a situation where the false teachers are teaching, and no doubt they're

403
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:36,099
influencing some, and maybe there's some, as it says, of which some having swerved in

404
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:41,299
verse number six, and these false teachers, they're teaching what they do not understand,

405
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:46,780
they're not qualified to do so, but yet they're gathering, they get a following.

406
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:54,220
You know, that can be discouraging for Timothy, can be discouraging for the man of God.

407
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,940
So what does God do?

408
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,140
God has Paul write him a letter.

409
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,260
Let me encourage you to continue.

410
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,900
Let me encourage you to understand that doctrine matters.

411
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,780
Because sometimes, if you're not careful, and I believe you've seen this in our churches

412
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:18,099
around America, even in the last generation, where churches just little by little change.

413
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:27,900
To accommodate, to be able to keep a crowd, to be able to pay a mortgage, yeah, they build

414
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,780
a big building, and they get a big mortgage, and all of a sudden, you can't afford to lose

415
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
people.

416
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,380
You understand what I'm saying?

417
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,619
I'm not advocating that you be unkind and try to lose people just by being unkind.

418
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:43,059
But what I'm saying is that doctrine matters.

419
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:49,140
And God is using Paul to write this letter to encourage Timothy and to help him understand

420
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,900
there's this emphasis that's placed on sound doctrine.

421
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,340
We've exposed the false teachers, they're not, listen, they've swerved, they've turned

422
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
their vein jangling.

423
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
They're not qualified.

424
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
They're teaching results.

425
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
They're not qualified.

426
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,340


427
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,380
It's in questions, not godly edifying.

428
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,100
And so Timothy understand the emphasis on doctrine.

429
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,480
We have to understand the importance

430
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,820
of proper interpretation and application of scripture.

431
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,820
He says that the law in verse number eight is good

432
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,540
if a man use it lawfully.

433
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,320
He then says in verses nine and 10,

434
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,780
knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,

435
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,120
but for the lawless and disobedient,

436
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,820
for the ungodly and for sinners,

437
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,520
for unholy and profane,

438
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,

439
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,800
for manslayers, for whoremongers,

440
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,020
for them that defile themselves with mankind,

441
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,760
for men stealers, for liars, for perjured persons.

442
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,140
And then he puts this clause in there.

443
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,600
And if there be any other thing

444
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
that is contrary to sound doctrine,

445
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,020
I like the last clause, amen.

446
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,920
Anything that's contrary to sound doctrine.

447
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,340
But we find that he lists a number of things here

448
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,500
and provides us with that detail.

449
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,660
But really what he's giving us is helping us to understand,

450
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,420
if we could say it this way, the purpose of the law.

451
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,300
What's the purpose of the law?

452
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,780
Well, the purpose of the law is very simply,

453
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,800
again, why would Paul deal with this?

454
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,300
Well, because the false teachers were mishandling the law

455
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,020
and therefore Paul begins right there with the law.

456
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,100
He says, let me help you understand the law is good

457
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,060
if a man use it lawfully.

458
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,740
And then he shares with and helps Timothy,

459
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,060
helps us understand the purpose of the law

460
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,540
in these few verses of scripture.

461
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,380
It's interesting because he speaks about sound doctrine

462
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,300
at the end of verse number 10.

463
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
And then as you go into verse number 11,

464
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,540
it says according to the glorious gospel

465
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,260
of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

466
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,660
So Paul understands that it was committed to him,

467
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,500
the gospel.

468
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
He says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

469
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,020
It's the power of God unto salvation,

470
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,900
to everyone that believe it,

471
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,620
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

472
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,060
In Romans chapter number one,

473
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,220
and Paul understood the responsibility

474
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,060
that had been given to him for it's been committed to him.

475
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,180
But it's interesting how he takes a direct line

476
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,020
from dealing with the law to the glorious gospel.

477
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,740
And really in these couple of verses of scripture,

478
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,560
and as we look at the book of Galatians,

479
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,380
we see that that's exactly the purpose of the law.

480
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,580
It exposes sin and points us to Jesus.

481
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,860
If we could boil it down to a simple statement,

482
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,980
the purpose of the law is to expose sin

483
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,580
and point us to Jesus.

484
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,300
Look in Galatians three, if you will.

485
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,220
As you're turning to Galatians three,

486
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,320
I'm going to read a verse of scripture to you

487
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,740
from the book of Romans.

488
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,300
Romans chapter seven and verse number seven.

489
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
And then I will meet you

490
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,900
over in Galatians chapter number three.

491
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,060
So Galatians chapter three,

492
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,460
we're gonna look at verses 21 through 24.

493
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,460
Give you a moment to turn there.

494
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,660
And then I want you to listen

495
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,260
as I read Romans seven and verse number seven.

496
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,660
In Romans seven, Paul says this in verse number seven.

497
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,580
What shall we say then?

498
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,460
Is the law sin?

499
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,100
God forbid.

500
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,540
Nay.

501
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,620
Notice what Paul says.

502
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,260
I had not known sin, but by the law.

503
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,380
For I had not known lust,

504
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,580
except the law had said, thou shall not covet.

505
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,120
So Paul is saying plainly his own testimony in Romans 7.7.

506
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,580
This is the purpose of the law.

507
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,980
He expounds on this in Galatians three.

508
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,860
Now understand the book of Galatians

509
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,460
is a book that is written to four churches

510
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,580
in the region of Galatia.

511
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,460
These four churches were established

512
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,260
during the first missionary journey.

513
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,360
And as these churches were established,

514
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,060
something happened in the region of Galatia.

515
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,700
And that was that these Judaizers came in.

516
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,460
And these Judaizers came in, they're very disappointed.

517
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,020
They're upset about the fact that people are being saved

518
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,620
and not following Judaism and so on and so forth.

519
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,480
And so they come in,

520
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,040
they try to bring in this false teaching, this mixture.

521
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,840
It really gives us what happens in Acts 15

522
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,080
that I mentioned earlier.

523
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,540
There were some that said you had to be circumcised

524
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,400
after the matter of Moses in order to be saved.

525
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,300
And so that's dealt with here in Galatians.

526
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,440
But in Galatians chapter number three in verse 24,

527
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,040
notice what Paul says.

528
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,840
Verse 21, we'll start in verse 21.

529
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,800
Is the law then against the promises of God?

530
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,520
God forbid.

531
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
For if there had been a law given

532
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,280
which could have given life,

533
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,800
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

534
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,000
But guess what?

535
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,360
The law can't give life.

536
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,080
All the law does is expose sin.

537
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,920
You know what the law does?

538
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,800
It condemns.

539
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,580
The law tells you that you're guilty.

540
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,200
And someone says, well, I'm not really that bad.

541
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,380
No, no, you're guilty.

542
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
And you're condemned.

543
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,840
And it's just the reality of the Bible.

544
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,360
And he says that the law,

545
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,120
if there had been a law given

546
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,160
which could have given life,

547
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,840
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

548
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,200
But, verse 22, the Scripture hath concluded all under sin

549
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,080
that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ

550
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,720
might be given to them that believe.

551
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,740
But before faith came, we were kept under the law,

552
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,000
shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

553
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Wherefore, notice verse 24,

554
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,920
the law was our schoolmaster for what purpose?

555
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
To bring us unto Christ.

556
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,880
That we might be justified not by the law,

557
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,140
for no flesh can be justified by the law, but by faith.

558
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,520
That word schoolmaster is an interesting word.

559
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,440
The word schoolmaster does not mean a teacher.

560
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,560
A lot of people think it means teacher.

561
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,020
It's not what it means.

562
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,120
The word schoolmaster is really within the context

563
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,720
of understanding the era of history in the society.

564
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,360
It was a guardian or a guide who would accompany

565
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,320
really privileged boys to be instructed.

566
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
They could not give the instruction,

567
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,140
but they took them to the one who could.

568
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,080
Now think about that just for a moment.

569
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,680
That's why he says the law's a schoolmaster.

570
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,380
It can't give you life,

571
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,100
but it can point you to the one that can.

572
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,520
By the way, let me say it this way, the only one that can.

573
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,600
In him was life.

574
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,640
Amen.

575
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,760
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture

576
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,120
in 1 Timothy, as Paul is writing and he's understanding,

577
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,440
again, God has given the word.

578
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,040
It's by inspiration that God understands the circumstances,

579
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,060
all that's taking place.

580
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,080
And Timothy is in Ephesus and he's supposed to be standing

581
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,120
and he's supposed to be teaching

582
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,960
and he's supposed to be charging others

583
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
that they teach no other doctrine.

584
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,360
But man, there's these false teachers

585
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,920
that they've come in and they've swerved from the truth

586
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,880
and they've turned into vain jangling

587
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,720
and they're teaching what they don't understand.

588
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
They're not qualified to do it,

589
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,520
but yet it seems as if there's some people

590
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,760
that are following them.

591
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,880
And Paul says, Timothy, doctrine matters.

592
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,400
Let me help you understand

593
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,440
as we look in 1 Timothy 1, the purpose of the law.

594
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,720
Timothy, don't be afraid of the law.

595
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,200
Just understand the purpose of the law.

596
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
Listen, if we know the truth,

597
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,200
we don't have to be afraid of any false teaching.

598
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,200
I don't have to be afraid of any other cult

599
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,640
or any other denomination or any other world religion.

600
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,320
I don't have to be afraid of it.

601
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,520
And by the way, I don't have to be a master

602
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,520
of what any of those particular religions would teach.

603
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,040
I have to be a master of this book.

604
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,560
And as I master this book,

605
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,680
as I understand the truth of this book,

606
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,600
then I simply am able to expose the error

607
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,360
because I know the truth.

608
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,600
You know, truth always exposes error.

609
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,120
Always.

610
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,680
Truth always exposes error.

611
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,880
That's why he said, sanctify them by thy word.

612
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Thy word is truth.

613
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,160
The truth of God's word.

614
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,440
Timothy, don't be afraid of the law.

615
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,120
Understand the purpose of the law.

616
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,160
Understand the purpose of the law.

617
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,480
Then we see the product of the law

618
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,800
because the law, it can't produce life,

619
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,960
but it points us to the one.

620
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,240
And as it points us to Jesus Christ,

621
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
it brings us to Christ.

622
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,800
And we find that as the law would bring us to Christ,

623
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,960
we look at verse number five.

624
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,720
Now the end of the commandment is charity

625
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,000
out of a pure heart and of a good conscience

626
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,960
and of faith unfeigned.

627
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,400
If I could summarize love, righteousness, and faith.

628
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,840
But those things don't come by the law.

629
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,960
They come through Christ

630
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,520
because we understand the purpose of the law

631
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,080
is to expose and to condemn,

632
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,840
but really to point us to the one who gives life,

633
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,559
the one who is love, the one who is righteous.

634
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,640
And he allows us to have that love

635
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,720
and that righteousness and that faith.

636
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,440
It enables us to be able to please him.

637
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,640
Listen, the law has a purpose.

638
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,800
The law points us to the Lord Jesus Christ.

639
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,000
And we see in verse number five, the result of that.

640
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Now I'm thankful this morning.

641
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,800
Again, we don't have to be intimidated by the law.

642
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,400
We don't have to be intimidated by the Old Testament.

643
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,200
We don't have to be intimidated by somebody coming

644
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,760
and saying, well, you know that the...

645
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,520
No, no, just study the Bible.

646
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,640
Interpret scripture with scripture.

647
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,800
Keep it within its context.

648
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,760
Amen.

649
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
I found so often what happens is people wanna grab

650
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,600
a verse of scripture out of context.

651
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,800
You say, hold on a minute, let's read that in its context.

652
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,120
Let's read the whole chapter.

653
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,720
Let's maybe read the chapter before

654
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,160
and the chapter after, right?

655
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,880
Let's look at some other verses of scripture

656
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,880
that God gives us, a parallel passage that God gives us.

657
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,720
I've said this, we should never build a doctrine

658
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,559
on a...

659
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:07,599
an obscurity when it's in opposition to an obvious.

660
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,239
There are some times that you go to the scripture and say, well, at the surface level it might

661
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,239
sound like this.

662
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,439
No, no, dig in.

663
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:17,519
In Hebrews chapter number six, so many people love to run to Hebrews chapter number six

664
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,259
and say you can lose your salvation.

665
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:26,479
The Bible all over the place calls it eternal security, eternal, or excuse me, eternal life,

666
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,839
everlasting life, right?

667
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,619
That's the gift of God.

668
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,719
And by the way, if you study Hebrews, you find in chapter number six, as they want to

669
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:41,119
go and run to that passage, that before and after chapter number six, you know what the

670
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,179
Bible talks about?

671
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:48,319
How that God is the author of eternal life, eternal salvation.

672
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,359
So you're going to tell me that prior to he tells us that he's the author of eternal salvation

673
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:57,399
and then he's going to tell you that you could lose it, it doesn't even make sense.

674
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:00,799
You can find that over and over and over.

675
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:07,360
Can I tell you this morning, false teachers are prevalent all over the place.

676
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,720
You know where they are very prevalent today?

677
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,360
On the internet.

678
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,939
On the internet.

679
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:16,939
On the internet.

680
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:25,799
Man, they get a lot of followers, get a lot of, you know, so often what happens it seems

681
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:30,519
as you can type in a question in Google, seems like Google knows everything.

682
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,879
Be careful.

683
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,439
Be careful.

684
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:38,599
You know, this AI stuff that's come out, be careful.

685
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,479
Be careful.

686
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:45,279
They're rewriting the Bible, be careful.

687
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:49,519
We've seen it in modern translations, but you see it, I read an article not long ago

688
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,519
in China.

689
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,399
Listen, China, they don't let you have a Bible in China, but all of a sudden they're rewriting

690
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:58,199
John chapter number 8.

691
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:04,559
John chapter number 8 deals with people bringing someone to Christ, a lady, that said she was

692
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,879
caught in the very act of adultery.

693
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:07,879
She should be stoned.

694
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:08,880
The law condemns her.

695
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,679
Well, actually, if you go back to the law, it condemns both he and she.

696
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,679
Amen?

697
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,679
Leviticus.

698
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:18,080
Just go back and read it.

699
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,440
But they want to see her stoned.

700
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,720
Jesus, as only He can, He just bends down as if He's not even listening to them.

701
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
He just starts writing.

702
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,239
I think He's writing their sin.

703
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,239
That's just what I believe.

704
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,239
I have no idea what He's writing.

705
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,239
It doesn't tell us.

706
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:37,239
But He's just writing, and He says, let him that hath no sin cast the first stone.

707
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,479
And then He says to her, hey, where are these nine accusers?

708
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:48,000
They're all gone, because they were guilty too.

709
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,479
And then Jesus said to her, go and sin no more.

710
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,479
Amen?

711
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:55,479
John 8.

712
00:42:55,479 --> 00:43:01,119
You know what they're saying in China?

713
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,479
After the accusers left, Jesus stoned her.

714
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:06,479
Yeah.

715
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:08,479
Yeah.

716
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:14,440
Do you understand what kind of picture that paints of Jesus?

717
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,919
Think about the ramifications.

718
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:19,679
Listen, false teaching is so prevalent today.

719
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,360
You type something in Google and you think the first results that pop up must be the

720
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,599
right ones.

721
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,759
That's not always true.

722
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:30,199
Those algorithms are not always in our best interest.

723
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:35,880
It's beyond my ability how they can process nine million websites as quickly as they can

724
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,440
and all that they do to provide you with the results that they provide you with.

725
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,800
But I would tell you that they're not, the first one that pops up isn't always the right

726
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
one.

727
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,160
You can't believe everything you see on the Internet.

728
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,000
You can't believe every YouTube preacher.

729
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't care how many followers they have.

730
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
God's Word exposes false teaching.

731
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,160
You can't believe the guy that has the biggest church.

732
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,360
And I'm not saying that all of those people are false teachers.

733
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,279
I'm simply saying we must be careful.

734
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:12,119
We must be careful, because false teachers, they exist, they're exposed by God's Word.

735
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,479
And then the emphasis is placed on sound doctrine.

736
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:24,519
As we continue, we must continue with the knowledge that doctrine matters.

737
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:30,040
Because we have to continue in a manner in which is pleasing to God.

738
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,679
God didn't just say continue and continue however you want.

739
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:37,000
No, continue and here's the path to continue on.

740
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,160
Continue carries with it in my mind the concept, if you will, of making progress.

741
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,600
But that progress is the right direction.

742
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,799
You ever find somebody that's busy, but they're not busy doing what they're supposed to be

743
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,559
doing?

744
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,040
You know what I'm saying?

745
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,919
You find some people on the work site that seem like they work harder to get out of work

746
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:58,919
than if they just work.

747
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:01,320
No, no.

748
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,040
He says we're to continue and he says doctrine matters.

749
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,919
Turn over to Jude and we'll end there.

750
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:10,720
Jude has one chapter.

751
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,600
And I want you to see what Jude writes of.

752
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:27,519
There is a great exposure of false teaching in this short letter, the short book of Jude.

753
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,440
Jude begins in verse number one.

754
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,760
Jude the servant of Jesus Christ, by the way, it's a good title, to be the servant of Jesus

755
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,799
Christ.

756
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:44,959
And brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ

757
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,639
and called.

758
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,519
Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.

759
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,000
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation.

760
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,480
This is not common as in just it's a low quality or of little value.

761
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,480
No, it's that they had common salvation amongst them.

762
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,600
They were saved by the grace of God.

763
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:13,040
He says, notice in verse number three, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort

764
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,480
you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the

765
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
saints.

766
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,480
So really, God allows Jude to express his heart in this book and say, I was planning

767
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,000
to write to you on this, but God said, no, this is needed.

768
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,239
You know, as a pastor, I can relate to that.

769
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,040
There are sometimes there's some messages I'd like to preach that are just kind of exhorting

770
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,279
kind of messages, and sometimes God says, no, we need this today, and I want to follow

771
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:43,399
the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God.

772
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:49,600
I shared with you a study that we did on Wednesday evening on Psalm 143 at the end of last year.

773
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,040
I didn't know why God led me there.

774
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,679
I was desiring to go a completely different way.

775
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,040
It was amazing after that study, actually in the midst of that study, there were a number

776
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,079
of people that came and said, I needed this.

777
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,279
God knows that.

778
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:05,200
I'm not smart enough to figure that out.

779
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,959
But God knows, and Jude says, I was desiring to write on this.

780
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:14,000
This is what I planned to write on, but it was needful for me to write unto you and to

781
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,279
exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered on

782
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:20,279
the saints.

783
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:21,279
Why?

784
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:24,559
Verse four, for there are certain men crept in.

785
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,200
Do you notice that word unawares?

786
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,600
You know what's interesting about false teachers?

787
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,440
They don't come in and say, hey, I'm a false teacher.

788
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,160
They don't have a banner that they carry, there's no sign on their forehead or on their

789
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,079
back that says, I'm a false teacher.

790
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,799
No, they come in unawares.

791
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:43,579
You know what happens often with these false teachers?

792
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:47,359
They try to use the same kind of terminology that you'll use.

793
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,919
I've said this before, that false teachers use our vocabulary but not our dictionary.

794
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:55,100
They'll use the same words.

795
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,919
You talk to somebody about being born again, they'll need something totally different.

796
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:59,480
Oh yeah, I was born again, I was baptized.

797
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,679
No, no, no, that's not being born again.

798
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,679
Amen?

799
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,600
That's not the Bible definition of being born again.

800
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,919
And so we see that it says that they've crept in unawares who were before of old ordained

801
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:16,239
to the condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and

802
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,799
denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

803
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:29,880
So Jude writes that these brethren would earnestly contend for the faith.

804
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
Why?

805
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,559
Because doctrine matters.

806
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,520
Faith that's mentioned here is really, it would encompass, if you will, that doctrine,

807
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
right?

808
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
All of that teaching.

809
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,919
And he says that we would earnestly contend for the faith.

810
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:53,359
Not today as we look at the truth, not all men love the Lord.

811
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,000
There are some that are the enemies of the cross.

812
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Now some are easy to identify, but some are not.

813
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,159
And Paul says, Timothy, continue.

814
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:11,400
God has equipped you, but here is the manner in which you must continue.

815
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Doctrine matters.

816
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,760
We must remember that.

817
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,799
As we go through this study this year, we must remember that in our own lives.

818
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:25,239
We do not bend, we do not fold on what thus saith the Lord.

819
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:28,880
You say, it's not popular anymore, Pastor.

820
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,279
God's Word endures.

821
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:35,159
God's Word stands.

822
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,719
We want to have the right position.

823
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,599
We want to have the right disposition.

824
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,659
We want to love people to Jesus.

825
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:48,039
But the reality is that God's Word is plain and doctrine matters.

826
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:49,039
Let's pray.

827
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:50,039
Father, we love you.

828
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:51,119
We thank you for loving us.

829
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,200
We thank you for the charge that was given to Timothy, and we thank you that after receiving

830
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,599
that charge and understanding how he'd been equipped, that there's an...

831
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:06,039
exposure of these false teachers. There's an emphasis on sound doctrine. God, I pray

832
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:13,119
that you would help us to be students of the Word, that we would study to show ourselves

833
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,539
approved. We'll see that as Paul writes to Timothy. I pray that you'd help us to know

834
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:22,639
how we ought to behave ourselves. We see that again as Paul writes to Timothy in the house

835
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:29,239
of God, understanding that it's the pillar and ground of the truth. God, help us to understand

836
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:38,479
that doctrine matters. Help us to know thy Word. Help us, Lord, not to be alarmed by

837
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:48,519
or worried about false teaching. Help us to simply be ground in the faith. Help us to

838
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:56,719
be students of your Word. God, I pray that as we, as individuals, seek to live our lives

839
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,599
to please you and to continue, Lord, I pray that you'd help us to understand that doctrine

840
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:09,079
matters. Help us to be careful of the books that we read, of the websites that we visit,

841
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:17,559
of the messages that we listen to. Lord, help us to prove, to try the spirits, to prove

842
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:26,399
all things, Lord, to understand that doctrine matters. I pray that you would move and work

843
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:31,759
in hearts and lives, Lord. We spoke about the purpose of the law, to expose sin. It

844
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:37,479
condemns. It cannot give life. It simply reveals that we're guilty. But it points us to the

845
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:43,919
one, the only one, the Lord Jesus Christ that can give life. God, I pray that if there's

846
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:48,239
one present this morning that's never been saved, God, I pray that you'd move and work

847
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,559
in their heart, Lord. Draw them to yourself. I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convince

848
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,159
them of their sin of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. I pray that in a

849
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,799
moment of invitation, Lord, this morning that we would be doers of the word and not hearers

850
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:09,119
only. Help us, Lord, to make that commitment to be students of the word, to know doctrine,

851
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,319
to be settled and grounded in the faith. Well, thank you for each decision that's made. For

852
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:16,559
it's in Christ's name we pray.
