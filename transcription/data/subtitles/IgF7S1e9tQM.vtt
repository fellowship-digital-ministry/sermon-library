00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
We're going to be looking at verses 5 through 11 this morning, 1 Timothy 1,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.719
verses 5 through 11. I'm thankful for God's Word, aren't you?

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.199
And what a blessing to have the Bible and so thankful for

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.640
the content and for the instruction that God gives us. We understand that all

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.040
Scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.479
for what? For doctrine is the first thing that's mentioned in 2 Timothy 3

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.159
and verse 16 when you look at that verse of Scripture.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.079
And so thankful for God's Word, the teaching of God's Word.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.240
We look at this portion of Scripture in 1 Timothy 1.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.799
We'll be looking this morning at verses 5 through 11. Last week as we looked at the

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:38.720
beginning

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.959
of this portion of Scripture, we concluded

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:46.520
that we have each been equipped for the task of continuing. We know, we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.279
understand this morning

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:52.080
as we'll study throughout this calendar year, the charge that is received that we

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.200
continue.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.959
And I said this last week, it's not enough to just understand the charge,

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.479
it's not even enough to accept the challenge, the call to continue.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.599
We must be equipped to continue. I'm thankful that God's given us all that we

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.360
need

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.680
and we understand that His

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.760
equipping of His saints and what a blessing to understand this morning

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.400
that He's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.519
and we dealt with His provision for us and what He provides us with, but

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:23.919
also the plan

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:28.319
that He has for each of us and as we are mindful of God's plan for us, even as we

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.000
noted

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.480
the plan that God had for Timothy, the plan that God had for Paul,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.160
that God also has a plan for us and that enables us to continue

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.239
and what a blessing. As we move through the text of Scripture,

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:44.400
we note the importance of doctrine and we receive instruction for how we are to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
continue

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.319
and we understand as we look here and we look to

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.559
the Scriptures, there's a right way and there's a wrong way. I believe this

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:55.760
morning that we must strive to continue

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.839
in the right doctrine, thus pleasing

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:02.440
the Lord. In verse number five, the Bible says, Now the end of the commandment is

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.160
charity out of a pure heart,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.000
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, from which some, having swerved, have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600
turned aside unto vain jangling,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600
desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.080
whereof they affirm.

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.800
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.080
knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.240
and disobedient,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.919
for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.639
fathers and murderers of mothers,

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.960
for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.479
for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons,

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:44.279
and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.839
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.880
which was committed to my trust.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.960
As we look here, and again as I made the statement already, we must strive to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960
continue in the right direction,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.119
thus pleasing the Lord, and as we continue, we must acknowledge the

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.679
biblical truth

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.720
that doctrine matters. That doctrine matters.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.360
Making good time going in the wrong direction

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.479
is no good. Amen? You say, man, I'm making great time, but you're going the wrong way.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.800
No one cares. It's not, you're not going to, you're just going to reach the wrong

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.600
destination sooner.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.160
And so we find this morning that doctrine matters. That's the title for the message.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.639
I will not take the time this morning to look at all the verses in 1st and

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.800
2nd Timothy.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.880
There are twelve verses within these chapters of Scripture, ten chapters,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.360
that reference in some way doctrine.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.639
And using the word specifically, and we'll study through those as we get

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.279
through the calendar year

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.399
as we come to each of those portions of Scripture. But what I want you to do this

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.559
morning by way of introduction is hold your place here in 1st Timothy, but turn on the

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.279
book of Titus, if you will,

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.679
and just so that we can understand and kind of wrap our minds around this

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.399
thought as we enter into the message this morning

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:05.839
that doctrine matters. Again, we live in a time, I mentioned this last week,

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.119
that the society in which we're living,

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.520
they're becoming less and less concerned about doctrine. If you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.119
think about Christendom,

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:19.920
very broadly speaking, and Christianity, people will use that terminology.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.119
And there are many that are saying, don't worry about doctrine.

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:28.880
Don't let doctrine divide. Well, doctrine will divide. Doctrine matters.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.559
And as we look at the Scriptures, we find in one reference before we look

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:34.480
here in Titus,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.279
that we understand that Paul had told Timothy

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.480
that the time will come when they will not endure

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.160
sound doctrine. So therefore, change your message to accommodate them so that

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.480
they'll keep coming.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.079
Is that what Paul told Timothy? No, that's not what Paul told Timothy.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:57.679
Paul told Timothy, preach the word. Be instant in season, out of season. Reprove,

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:58.880
rebuke, exhort

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.799
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:05.880
And then he tells them, but they're not going to endure sound doctrine.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.119
But it doesn't change the charge to continue to preach the word and to

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:10.359
preach doctrine.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:13.440
Why? Because doctrine matters. In the book of Titus,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.760
Paul is writing to Titus, again,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.239
another that he would refer to as his son of the faith, a man

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:25.519
that he was investing in, understanding the course that he would run, just as

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.160
he's invested in Timothy.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.959
But I want you to notice, in Titus 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this,

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.839
for this cause left I thee in Crete.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.040
And so we find, just like he gave the charge to Timothy in 1 Timothy

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.559
chapter 1 that we looked at last week with what

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:44.119
Paul's charge was to him to, as Paul was going to leave to go to Macedonia, that

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:46.640
he stays in Ephesus, remember,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.640
that he charged them not to teach anything that's contrary to the doctrine,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.040
and he left him there for that purpose. Remember, as we look back at Acts 20 last

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.600
week,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.720
Paul knew that after his departure there would be some grievous wolves that would

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.119
come in, not sparing the flock of God.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.760
He also knew of their own selves there would be men that would rise up.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.640
And so Paul, God gave Paul the direction, God in his infinite wisdom

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.600
says, Timothy is going to stay here, and he's going to help preserve this doctrine,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.799
this teaching,

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:22.679
that I want to be preserved. Well, for Titus here, Paul says, for this cause left

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:24.040
I thee in Crete,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.480
that thou shouldest set in order things that are wanting. There were some

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.600
problems.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.239
And he says, and ordain elders in every city

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:37.839
as I had appointed thee. So we see the responsibility of Titus,

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.959
but then I want you to notice in the next few verses, as we kind of pick our

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.200
way through here by way of introduction,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.000
the emphasis even here on doctrine. In verse number 9 of Titus 1,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.359
the Bible says, speaking about these qualifications for those that he would

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.760
set in order,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.720
ordaining these elders in every city, it says in verse 9,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.399
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught,

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.559
that he may be able, notice, by sound

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.640
doctrine, both to exhort and to convince

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.760
the gainsayers. Why? For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.440
especially they of the circumcision. We know that when he uses that terminology,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.000
the circumcision, he's speaking about Jews,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.079
and we find that he's saying, listen, there's going to be some people that are coming in

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:29.079
with some false teaching. Guess what? We're going to deal with that in 1st Timothy

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.320
this morning as well.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.160
And we find that he talks about being sound in doctrine,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.480
that they're holding fast the faithful word

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.519
as he hath been taught. In verse number 13, this witness is true,

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.720
wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.600
in the faith. Verse 16, they profess that they know God,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.000
but in works they deny Him. Being abominable

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.239
and disobedient and unto every good

00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:02.600
work reprobate, but speak, chapter 2 and verse number 1,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.679
thou the things which become

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:12.119
sound doctrine. We find that as soon as the church is established

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:15.640
and the church is moving forward for the cause of Christ,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.720
we understand that there are false teachers that would show up on the scene.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.839
The reality is that those false teachers were there then, and they continue to be

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.679
here still to this day.

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:30.320
And we find that as we look back in 1st Timothy chapter number 1 and begin to

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.799
dissect this portion of scripture this morning,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.840
notice with me first of all the exposure

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.840
of false teachers. I'm thankful that God is able to expose false teaching.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.440
I'm thankful that He has given us His word so that we too might be able to

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.280
expose false teaching.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.280
Not everything that you listen, not every eloquent speaker, because of their

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:54.599
eloquence means that what they're saying is true.

00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:58.760
Amen? There are some people, listen, not the person that has the most follows,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.000
the most likes, the most people that are

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.039
going and liking their post and following them, it doesn't mean that

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:06.479
they're right.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:10.840
Amen? How do we determine what's right and what's wrong?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.960
Right here, the Bible. He says in 1st John that we're to try the

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.440
spirits.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.000
Amen? We understand, and we'll mention at the end of the message this morning in

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.320
Jude, that we're to earnestly contend

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.000
for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints, and we find the exposure

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.440
of false teachers here in this portion of scripture. Notice in verse number 6

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.799
where He begins to introduce us to these false teachers, He's already spoken

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:38.679
about the

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:43.359
call that He gave Him, that He would charge some, according to verse number 3,

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:45.200
that they teach no other doctrine,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.520
neither would they give heed to fables and endless genealogies. But in verse

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.440
number 6,

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:50.760
notice He says,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.719
from which some,

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.599
having, do you see that word swerved?

00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:59.960
It's kind of an interesting word. It says that from some having swerved have turned

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:08.760
aside unto vain jangling." As God is giving His Word here and as Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.840
we find that he is exposing these false teachers, their exposure is noted, where they are being

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.920
exposed for their false teaching. He says that these are described as being those that

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:27.480
have swerved. It means to deviate from, it means to miss the mark. In my mind, it really

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:35.620
has the exact opposite of continue. They've swerved. They've turned aside. They've deviated

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:42.240
from the path that has been established and they've swerved. The Bible tells us that they've

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.060
swerved and notice they've turned aside unto vain jangling. That's kind of interesting

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.840
phraseology, isn't it? You know what it means? Useless talk. Useless talk. You ever listen

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.280
to somebody that talks for a long time and they don't really say anything? You know what

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.360
I mean? You hear somebody give a presentation, a speech, and you're kind of like, what in

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:11.920
the world? There's no real meat to the message. And here he talks about this vain jangling,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.440
this useless talk, and really when we look at verse number 6 and see how these false

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.240
teachers are being exposed and we see that they have swerved, they've deviated from the

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:29.000
path, they've missed the mark, they've turned to vain jangling, this useless talk, we find

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.920
that really what's happening in verse number 4, which we studied last week, it gives us

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.280
some insight into this useless talk. It was that they were dealing with these fables and

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.880
these endless genealogies and you know what the result was? The result was questions,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.560
not godly edifying. And we see that in verse number 4. And so we find that as we look here

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.800
and we see how these false teachers are being exposed, that Paul says they've swerved, they've

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.920
turned to vain jangling. But then as we come to verse number 7, we see that these false

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.040
teachers, they're really not qualified. Notice the Bible says, desiring to be teachers of

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.800
the law. Now if we just stopped right there, we'd say that's a commendable desire, to be

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.880
a teacher of the law. That's a commendable desire, but notice what Paul says, understanding

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:26.180
neither what they say nor whereof they affirm. So they have a desire but they're not qualified.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.900
They simply don't know what they're talking about, if we could put it in very basic English

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.160
this morning. And so we find that here, as Paul is saying that they're not qualified,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.000
it's very interesting when we look at how these false teachers are being exposed in

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.200
the first chapter, that later on, a couple of chapters later in chapter 3, and we'll

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.480
look at it in great detail as we move through the book, but turn over just for a moment

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.480
to chapter 3, and notice what the Bible says in verse number 1 of chapter number 3 of this

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.760
book. This is a true saying. If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.480
work. And so we see here that thought of desire, we see it in verse number 7 of chapter 1,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.520
these that were false teachers, they had a desire to teach the law, but they weren't

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.240
qualified, and so we find that in chapter number 3, God gives a list of qualifications

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:22.640
for those that would desire the office of a bishop. You know one of them at the end

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:32.080
of verse number 2? Apt to teach. Apt to teach. In chapter number 1 in verse number 7, he

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.480
says they desire to be teachers of the law, but they understand neither what they say

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:45.080
nor whereof they affirm. In the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary, one of the definitions

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:54.560
that is given for the word apt is qualified or fit. And so we find that these false teachers

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.280
that are being mentioned here, that are being exposed in this portion of Scripture, in the

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:04.640
very introduction to this letter, we find that these false teachers are being exposed

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.920
and God is giving instruction to Timothy on how to deal with this. We'll look at it in

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.760
just a moment. But we understand the way that these folks, they've swerved, they've turned

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:22.080
to vain jangling, they're not qualified. What are they doing? Well, they did not properly

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.600
understand or apply the Old Testament law. Really, as we look at the text of Scripture,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.960
we see exactly that's what's being dealt with. And they did not properly understand

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:38.200
it, nor did they properly apply the Old Testament law. In fact, in Acts chapter 15, if you were

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.080
to look there in that portion of Scripture and see the council at Jerusalem and what's

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.320
taking place, in Acts 15.1, there were people that were coming, these Judaizers, and they

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.840
were saying, except a man be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.400
Now Paul, he was having none of that. No, no, no. That is not true. And there was a

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:07.280
big conversation, a council that's recorded for us in Acts 15 in Jerusalem of all that

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.280
took place with that. And you know what they concluded? That they're saved just like we're

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.680
saved by grace through faith because it's the blood of Jesus Christ, His death barrel

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:23.760
and glorious resurrection that allows for a man, woman, boy, girl to be saved. Amen?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.140
Has nothing to do with circumcision, has nothing to do with baptism, has nothing to

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:35.640
do with any other religious rite or ritual. It's through the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen?

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:42.000
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture that they did not notice understanding

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.120
in verse number 7, neither what they say nor whereof they affirm. Paul then immediately

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.640
gets into the subject of the law. Why would Paul deal with the subject of the law? Well,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.960
that's because that's where they've erred. That's where they've gone astray. That's where

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.160
they've swore from. That's where they've turned to vain jangling. And we find that Paul is

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.120
going to set the record straight. He's going to help them to understand the sound doctrine.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.640
And so we see that they did not properly understand. We find that their teaching, as I mentioned

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.240
a moment ago, it resulted in questions, not in godly edifying.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.200
Now understand this morning that it's certainly appropriate and applicable that even still

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:30.880
today that teaching may result in questions, but those questions can be answered by God's

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:39.640
Word. The idea of what's being given here in verse number 4 about these false teachers

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.320
that it generates these questions which minister questions is that it just leaves people at

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:52.680
a dead end. You know, a lot of religion today leaves people at a dead end. They're confused.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:01.480
No hope, no peace, no direction, confusion. By the way, who's the author of confusion?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.640
Not my God. Satan is the author of confusion. And we find that, I'm thankful, listen, we

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.480
say it often, that the Bible has the answer. Aren't you thankful for that? I was reading

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.840
this morning the book of Numbers. Somebody shared with me a testimony about reading Leviticus.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.560
I just finished Leviticus just a couple of days ago. Man, I love the book of Leviticus.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.200
I know so many people say, man, the book of Leviticus. Man, it is a great book that really

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.480
shows the work and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and His offering that He made for us.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.400
I mean, it's a precious book. But I was in the book of Numbers this morning and there's

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.280
a unique thing that happened in the life and ministry of Moses. There was a circumstance

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.240
that came up that had not been given direction from God yet. You know what Moses did? He

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.600
said, hold on, let me go ask God. And he went to the Lord and guess what God did? He gave

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:53.640
him an answer. Praise God. We have a Bible. God's given us this book. And in this book,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.260
the Bible, we often sing the B-I-B-L-E. Yes, that's the book for me. And I'm thankful that

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.040
our doctrine is based on the Bible, the Bible teaching. And we go to the Bible. We have

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.080
a question. We say, Lord, you've given us this book. Provide us with the answer. Help

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.880
us to have an understanding. Illumine the scriptures to us so that we might understand

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.920
what you desire, what your plan is. And we go to the Bible and we understand that God's

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.600
given us principles. And those principles are applicable in life. And we see that what

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.360
was happening with these false teachers is that it was leaving them, those followers

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.160
at this dead end, these questions that could not be answered, no hope and no peace. And

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.240
Paul is exposing, God is exposing the false teachers. Now, here's something for us to

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.040
be mindful of this morning, that false teachers were present and active in the beginning of

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:56.040
the church and they're present and active in this day of the church age. We find that

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:02.200
the scriptures say this, Paul exposes false teaching. God uses Paul to expose false teaching.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.520
God uses Peter to expose false teaching. Of course, there's a number of other portions

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.160
of scripture that we could go to, but each of them have portions of scripture in their

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.480
books that deal with the characteristics of false teaching. Jude deals with it as well,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.320
but you see, you can just go through those characteristics. But Peter says this, he says,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.480
as there were false prophets, even so there will be false teachers. Now, understand what

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.240
Peter is communicating there as he says that. The people of God could understand, you and

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.600
I this morning can understand as we go to the Old Testament and read the Old Testament

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:43.119
that there are many references that God has recorded for us of false prophets that existed

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:47.880
in the Old Testament. And so Peter says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:55.040
just as there were false prophets then, there will be false teachers today. So God's Word

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.880
exposes false teaching. And I'm thankful for that.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.160
When we look here at this portion of Scripture, we find not only the exposure of false teaching,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.920
but number two, we find the emphasis on sound doctrine.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.000
The emphasis on sound doctrine.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.200
I mentioned already that these false teachers were mishandling the law, and therefore, what

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200
does Paul do?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.480
He addresses the law.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.560
Notice in verse number eight, as we continue, we'll get to verse number five at the end

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.420
of the message, but notice in verse number eight, the Bible says, but we know.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.700
Now that's a level of confidence, is it not?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:36.240
He says, we don't think, he's not saying, no, we know that the law is good.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:43.160
If a man use it lawfully, do you know what that word lawfully means?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.360
It means properly.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.600
It means properly.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:53.360
So what was happening with the false teachers, I mentioned that they did not properly understand

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.520
or apply the Old Testament law.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.260
We can talk about the idea of legalism, and we can talk about the idea of obtaining some

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.860
level of grace and favor, merit from God because of this outward obedience to the law.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.800
That's not the purpose of the law.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.900
That's not properly understanding or applying the law, and we find, we'll end ourselves

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.780
in the book of Galatians at some point this morning, but we find that he says that the

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.860
law is good, but it must be used lawfully, properly.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.640
This in verse number 10, we'll go back to verse nine in just a moment.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.720
At the end of verse number 10, it says, and if there be any other thing that is contrary

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.440
to sound doctrine.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.200
Now as we look at the word lawfully in verse number eight, we see that that means properly.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.040
As we come to verse number 10, and we see the phrase of sound doctrine, the word sound

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.400
means to be healthy.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:57.800
It means this, to be free from any mixture of error, to be free from any mixture of error.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.900
You know, one of the things and one of the reasons that we're going to have in our Sunday

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.000
school class for the next several weeks, a study on why we use the King James Bible,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.279
you understand why, how the enemy is seeking to introduce error, to mix truth with error

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:16.559
is through so many of the modern translations.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:21.559
So many of the modern translations today, all of a sudden there's this mixture of error,

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:26.380
there's this confusion, there's this contradiction that you'll find in a number of these new

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.720
modern translations, and we're just going to go ahead and study through a bunch of them

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.520
and just let it be said, here's what these modern translations say, and here's where

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.040
they're wrong, and here's how it changes doctrine.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.380
Doctrine matters.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.720
The enemy is behind that, for the enemy is the one in Genesis chapter number three that

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:52.760
said, yea, hath God said, ye shall not surely die, no, in the day that ye eat thereof you'll

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.639
be like gods.

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:58.680
That's what Satan said in Genesis three.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.900
By the way, he's a liar, he's the father of it, amen?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:11.600
We find here that as Paul would use these words, every word of God is pure, God gave

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.320
him these words lawfully to have a proper understanding and application of the law.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.300
Sound doctrine, that which is healthy, that which is free from any mixture of error, obviously

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:31.040
when you look at the teaching of these false teachers, it's nothing, it's not sound.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.840
It's infiltrated with error, it's diseased, if you will, if we could look at the use of

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.320
that word sound and looking at the contradiction between that which is appropriate and to be

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.240
taught versus that which these false teachers were teaching, and so when we look at the

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.720
emphasis on sound doctrine, let me say this, proper interpretation and application of Scripture

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.160
is absolutely essential.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.600
Proper interpretation and application of Scripture.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:08.040
Peter says in 2 Peter 1 verse 20 and 21 that no prophecy is of any private interpretation.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.440
So often, and I'm going to make a number of statements here with regard to proper interpretation

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.860
and application of Scripture, we talk about the interpretation of Scripture, a theological

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:21.480
word that's used as hermeneutics, right, the hermeneutical approach to interpreting Scripture,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.980
hermeneutics, and we find here that when we deal with the proper interpretation and application

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.760
of Scripture, the context is key.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.720
You know how a lot of false teachings have been raised?

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.600
Through taking Scripture out of context.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.119
You take one verse of Scripture and you just remove it from its context and you build some

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:49.559
teaching on this singular verse of Scripture, giving no mind to the context in which that

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.559
truth was given.

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:53.360
It's a very dangerous thing.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.540
Every once in a while I'll preach a topical message.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.260
Exegetical messages are enjoyable to preach, no doubt.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.480
Primarily I preach exegetical messages.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.640
I like to preach within the context of what the Scriptures…

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.739
I love preaching through books of the Bible.

00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:15.179
If you've been here since I've been here, I don't know, there's like 24, 26 books

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:19.500
of the Bible that I have preached or taught through in the 12 years that I've been here,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.660
and we go verse by verse through those books of Scripture, and that helps…

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.100
What is it saying in the Old Testament?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.580
Line upon line, precept upon precept.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:36.660
And so many false teachings have been made just so available to people by taking a verse

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.860
out of context.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.420
Let me say this, there must be an understanding of whether the verse of Scripture is to be

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.739
interpreted literally or figuratively.

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:53.020
We must be careful not to over-spiritualize or under-spiritualize.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.179
We must keep it within context, and sometimes there's literal, sometimes there's figurative.

00:25:58.179 --> 00:25:59.179
We understand that.

00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:03.420
When we talk about some of the figurative, we'd understand some of these manners of

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.820
writing.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820
And the Bible…

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.739
Listen, there are times in which the Bible uses metaphors.

00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:12.619
There are times in which the Bible uses allegories.

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:19.260
In fact, Paul says in Galatians, this is an allegory, right?

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.059
He's giving us an understanding of a passage of Scripture in the book of Genesis when he

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:29.100
refers to it as being an allegory, so metaphors, allegories, similes.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.820
We think about parables.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.420
Jesus often taught with parables, right?

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.660
And so we have to understand that as we take and look at the Scriptures and we desire to

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:46.459
understand that doctrine matters, that when we build our faith, our doctrine, our teaching,

00:26:46.459 --> 00:26:52.059
that proper interpretation and application of Scripture is key.

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:56.820
As you look in this portion of Scripture, Timothy is being given this charge.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.300
He's received the charge already in verse number three, as I besought thee.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.000
This is something that happened before, and now Paul is writing back to him.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.619
As you would understand the way in which this is being given to Timothy, Paul had given

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:11.619
him this charge.

00:27:11.619 --> 00:27:13.940
He says, as I besought thee to abide.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.860
And as Timothy had this responsibility, the understanding God's plan for his life, it

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.020
began to get hard, because there's false teachers.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.260
You know what's interesting?

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.700
It seems as if a lot of false teachers can get a great following of people.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.619
You ever notice that?

00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:35.940
They wax eloquent, they say all these things, and man, all of a sudden people just start

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.940
following me.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.980
You're like, hey, what in the world?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.660
At one point, I don't know that it's true any longer, I've not seen statistics on this

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.140
for probably at least a decade, but statistics a couple of decades ago would indicate that

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:57.100
a number of cults in America, that one of the number one quote-unquote convert that

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.619
they received was from Baptist churches.

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:01.899
You say, what in the world?

00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:05.700
How does somebody that's sitting in a Baptist church hearing the teaching of God's word,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.940
if it's being done appropriately, if the pastor is teaching and preaching and placing the

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.739
emphasis on sound doctrine, how does a cult member show up at your door or my door and

00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:20.220
get me to turn my back on what God says and follow them?

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.940
But you see the evidence of it.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.540
Timothy is in a situation where the false teachers are teaching, and no doubt they're

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.099
influencing some, and maybe there's some, as it says, of which some having swerved in

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:41.299
verse number six, and these false teachers, they're teaching what they do not understand,

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:46.780
they're not qualified to do so, but yet they're gathering, they get a following.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:54.220
You know, that can be discouraging for Timothy, can be discouraging for the man of God.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.940
So what does God do?

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.140
God has Paul write him a letter.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.260
Let me encourage you to continue.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.900
Let me encourage you to understand that doctrine matters.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.780
Because sometimes, if you're not careful, and I believe you've seen this in our churches

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:18.099
around America, even in the last generation, where churches just little by little change.

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:27.900
To accommodate, to be able to keep a crowd, to be able to pay a mortgage, yeah, they build

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.780
a big building, and they get a big mortgage, and all of a sudden, you can't afford to lose

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.780
people.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.380
You understand what I'm saying?

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.619
I'm not advocating that you be unkind and try to lose people just by being unkind.

00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:43.059
But what I'm saying is that doctrine matters.

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:49.140
And God is using Paul to write this letter to encourage Timothy and to help him understand

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.900
there's this emphasis that's placed on sound doctrine.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.340
We've exposed the false teachers, they're not, listen, they've swerved, they've turned

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.340
their vein jangling.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.340
They're not qualified.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.340
They're teaching results.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340
They're not qualified.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:00.340


00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.380
It's in questions, not godly edifying.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.100
And so Timothy understand the emphasis on doctrine.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.480
We have to understand the importance

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.820
of proper interpretation and application of scripture.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.820
He says that the law in verse number eight is good

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.540
if a man use it lawfully.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.320
He then says in verses nine and 10,

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.780
knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.120
but for the lawless and disobedient,

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.820
for the ungodly and for sinners,

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.520
for unholy and profane,

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.320
for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.800
for manslayers, for whoremongers,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.020
for them that defile themselves with mankind,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.760
for men stealers, for liars, for perjured persons.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.140
And then he puts this clause in there.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.600
And if there be any other thing

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.320
that is contrary to sound doctrine,

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.020
I like the last clause, amen.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.920
Anything that's contrary to sound doctrine.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.340
But we find that he lists a number of things here

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.500
and provides us with that detail.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.660
But really what he's giving us is helping us to understand,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.420
if we could say it this way, the purpose of the law.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.300
What's the purpose of the law?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.780
Well, the purpose of the law is very simply,

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.800
again, why would Paul deal with this?

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.300
Well, because the false teachers were mishandling the law

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.020
and therefore Paul begins right there with the law.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.100
He says, let me help you understand the law is good

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.060
if a man use it lawfully.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.740
And then he shares with and helps Timothy,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.060
helps us understand the purpose of the law

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.540
in these few verses of scripture.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.380
It's interesting because he speaks about sound doctrine

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.300
at the end of verse number 10.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.700
And then as you go into verse number 11,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.540
it says according to the glorious gospel

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.260
of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.660
So Paul understands that it was committed to him,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.500
the gospel.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500
He says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.020
It's the power of God unto salvation,

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.900
to everyone that believe it,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.620
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.060
In Romans chapter number one,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.220
and Paul understood the responsibility

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.060
that had been given to him for it's been committed to him.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.180
But it's interesting how he takes a direct line

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.020
from dealing with the law to the glorious gospel.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.740
And really in these couple of verses of scripture,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.560
and as we look at the book of Galatians,

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.380
we see that that's exactly the purpose of the law.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.580
It exposes sin and points us to Jesus.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.860
If we could boil it down to a simple statement,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.980
the purpose of the law is to expose sin

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.580
and point us to Jesus.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.300
Look in Galatians three, if you will.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.220
As you're turning to Galatians three,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.320
I'm going to read a verse of scripture to you

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.740
from the book of Romans.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.300
Romans chapter seven and verse number seven.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.500
And then I will meet you

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.900
over in Galatians chapter number three.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.060
So Galatians chapter three,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.460
we're gonna look at verses 21 through 24.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.460
Give you a moment to turn there.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.660
And then I want you to listen

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.260
as I read Romans seven and verse number seven.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.660
In Romans seven, Paul says this in verse number seven.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.580
What shall we say then?

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.460
Is the law sin?

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.100
God forbid.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.540
Nay.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.620
Notice what Paul says.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.260
I had not known sin, but by the law.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.380
For I had not known lust,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.580
except the law had said, thou shall not covet.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.120
So Paul is saying plainly his own testimony in Romans 7.7.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.580
This is the purpose of the law.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.980
He expounds on this in Galatians three.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.860
Now understand the book of Galatians

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.460
is a book that is written to four churches

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.580
in the region of Galatia.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.460
These four churches were established

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.260
during the first missionary journey.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.360
And as these churches were established,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.060
something happened in the region of Galatia.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.700
And that was that these Judaizers came in.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.460
And these Judaizers came in, they're very disappointed.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.020
They're upset about the fact that people are being saved

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.620
and not following Judaism and so on and so forth.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.480
And so they come in,

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.040
they try to bring in this false teaching, this mixture.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.840
It really gives us what happens in Acts 15

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.080
that I mentioned earlier.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.540
There were some that said you had to be circumcised

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.400
after the matter of Moses in order to be saved.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.300
And so that's dealt with here in Galatians.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.440
But in Galatians chapter number three in verse 24,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.040
notice what Paul says.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.840
Verse 21, we'll start in verse 21.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.800
Is the law then against the promises of God?

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.520
God forbid.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.120
For if there had been a law given

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.280
which could have given life,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.800
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.000
But guess what?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.360
The law can't give life.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.080
All the law does is expose sin.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.920
You know what the law does?

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.800
It condemns.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.580
The law tells you that you're guilty.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.200
And someone says, well, I'm not really that bad.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.380
No, no, you're guilty.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.400
And you're condemned.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.840
And it's just the reality of the Bible.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.360
And he says that the law,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.120
if there had been a law given

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.160
which could have given life,

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.840
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.200
But, verse 22, the Scripture hath concluded all under sin

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.080
that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.720
might be given to them that believe.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.740
But before faith came, we were kept under the law,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.000
shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Wherefore, notice verse 24,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.920
the law was our schoolmaster for what purpose?

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.520
To bring us unto Christ.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.880
That we might be justified not by the law,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.140
for no flesh can be justified by the law, but by faith.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.520
That word schoolmaster is an interesting word.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.440
The word schoolmaster does not mean a teacher.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.560
A lot of people think it means teacher.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.020
It's not what it means.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.120
The word schoolmaster is really within the context

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.720
of understanding the era of history in the society.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.360
It was a guardian or a guide who would accompany

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.320
really privileged boys to be instructed.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.960
They could not give the instruction,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.140
but they took them to the one who could.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.080
Now think about that just for a moment.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.680
That's why he says the law's a schoolmaster.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.380
It can't give you life,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.100
but it can point you to the one that can.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.520
By the way, let me say it this way, the only one that can.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.600
In him was life.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.640
Amen.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.760
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.120
in 1 Timothy, as Paul is writing and he's understanding,

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.440
again, God has given the word.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.040
It's by inspiration that God understands the circumstances,

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.060
all that's taking place.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.080
And Timothy is in Ephesus and he's supposed to be standing

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.120
and he's supposed to be teaching

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.960
and he's supposed to be charging others

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.480
that they teach no other doctrine.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.360
But man, there's these false teachers

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.920
that they've come in and they've swerved from the truth

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.880
and they've turned into vain jangling

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.720
and they're teaching what they don't understand.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.280
They're not qualified to do it,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.520
but yet it seems as if there's some people

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.760
that are following them.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.880
And Paul says, Timothy, doctrine matters.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.400
Let me help you understand

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.440
as we look in 1 Timothy 1, the purpose of the law.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.720
Timothy, don't be afraid of the law.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.200
Just understand the purpose of the law.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.720
Listen, if we know the truth,

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.200
we don't have to be afraid of any false teaching.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.200
I don't have to be afraid of any other cult

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.640
or any other denomination or any other world religion.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.320
I don't have to be afraid of it.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.520
And by the way, I don't have to be a master

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.520
of what any of those particular religions would teach.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.040
I have to be a master of this book.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.560
And as I master this book,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.680
as I understand the truth of this book,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.600
then I simply am able to expose the error

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.360
because I know the truth.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.600
You know, truth always exposes error.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.120
Always.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.680
Truth always exposes error.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.880
That's why he said, sanctify them by thy word.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.360
Thy word is truth.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.160
The truth of God's word.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.440
Timothy, don't be afraid of the law.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.120
Understand the purpose of the law.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.160
Understand the purpose of the law.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.480
Then we see the product of the law

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.800
because the law, it can't produce life,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.960
but it points us to the one.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.240
And as it points us to Jesus Christ,

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.680
it brings us to Christ.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.800
And we find that as the law would bring us to Christ,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.960
we look at verse number five.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.720
Now the end of the commandment is charity

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.000
out of a pure heart and of a good conscience

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.960
and of faith unfeigned.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.400
If I could summarize love, righteousness, and faith.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.840
But those things don't come by the law.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.960
They come through Christ

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.520
because we understand the purpose of the law

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.080
is to expose and to condemn,

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.840
but really to point us to the one who gives life,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.559
the one who is love, the one who is righteous.

00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:00.640
And he allows us to have that love

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.720
and that righteousness and that faith.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.440
It enables us to be able to please him.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.640
Listen, the law has a purpose.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.800
The law points us to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.000
And we see in verse number five, the result of that.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.600
Now I'm thankful this morning.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.800
Again, we don't have to be intimidated by the law.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.400
We don't have to be intimidated by the Old Testament.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.200
We don't have to be intimidated by somebody coming

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.760
and saying, well, you know that the...

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.520
No, no, just study the Bible.

00:39:28.559 --> 00:39:30.640
Interpret scripture with scripture.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.800
Keep it within its context.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.760
Amen.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.720
I found so often what happens is people wanna grab

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.600
a verse of scripture out of context.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.800
You say, hold on a minute, let's read that in its context.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.120
Let's read the whole chapter.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.720
Let's maybe read the chapter before

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.160
and the chapter after, right?

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.880
Let's look at some other verses of scripture

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.880
that God gives us, a parallel passage that God gives us.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.720
I've said this, we should never build a doctrine

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.559
on a...

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:07.599
an obscurity when it's in opposition to an obvious.

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:11.239
There are some times that you go to the scripture and say, well, at the surface level it might

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:12.239
sound like this.

00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:14.439
No, no, dig in.

00:40:14.439 --> 00:40:17.519
In Hebrews chapter number six, so many people love to run to Hebrews chapter number six

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:21.259
and say you can lose your salvation.

00:40:21.259 --> 00:40:26.479
The Bible all over the place calls it eternal security, eternal, or excuse me, eternal life,

00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:28.839
everlasting life, right?

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:30.619
That's the gift of God.

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:34.719
And by the way, if you study Hebrews, you find in chapter number six, as they want to

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:41.119
go and run to that passage, that before and after chapter number six, you know what the

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:42.179
Bible talks about?

00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:48.319
How that God is the author of eternal life, eternal salvation.

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:52.359
So you're going to tell me that prior to he tells us that he's the author of eternal salvation

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:57.399
and then he's going to tell you that you could lose it, it doesn't even make sense.

00:40:57.399 --> 00:41:00.799
You can find that over and over and over.

00:41:00.799 --> 00:41:07.360
Can I tell you this morning, false teachers are prevalent all over the place.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.720
You know where they are very prevalent today?

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.360
On the internet.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.939
On the internet.

00:41:15.939 --> 00:41:16.939
On the internet.

00:41:16.939 --> 00:41:25.799
Man, they get a lot of followers, get a lot of, you know, so often what happens it seems

00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:30.519
as you can type in a question in Google, seems like Google knows everything.

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:32.879
Be careful.

00:41:32.879 --> 00:41:34.439
Be careful.

00:41:34.439 --> 00:41:38.599
You know, this AI stuff that's come out, be careful.

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:41.479
Be careful.

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:45.279
They're rewriting the Bible, be careful.

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:49.519
We've seen it in modern translations, but you see it, I read an article not long ago

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:50.519
in China.

00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:55.399
Listen, China, they don't let you have a Bible in China, but all of a sudden they're rewriting

00:41:55.399 --> 00:41:58.199
John chapter number 8.

00:41:58.199 --> 00:42:04.559
John chapter number 8 deals with people bringing someone to Christ, a lady, that said she was

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:06.879
caught in the very act of adultery.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:07.879
She should be stoned.

00:42:07.879 --> 00:42:08.880
The law condemns her.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.679
Well, actually, if you go back to the law, it condemns both he and she.

00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:13.679
Amen?

00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:14.679
Leviticus.

00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:18.080
Just go back and read it.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.440
But they want to see her stoned.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.720
Jesus, as only He can, He just bends down as if He's not even listening to them.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720
He just starts writing.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.239
I think He's writing their sin.

00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:29.239
That's just what I believe.

00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.239
I have no idea what He's writing.

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:31.239
It doesn't tell us.

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:37.239
But He's just writing, and He says, let him that hath no sin cast the first stone.

00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:41.479
And then He says to her, hey, where are these nine accusers?

00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:48.000
They're all gone, because they were guilty too.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.479
And then Jesus said to her, go and sin no more.

00:42:53.479 --> 00:42:54.479
Amen?

00:42:54.479 --> 00:42:55.479
John 8.

00:42:55.479 --> 00:43:01.119
You know what they're saying in China?

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:04.479
After the accusers left, Jesus stoned her.

00:43:04.479 --> 00:43:06.479
Yeah.

00:43:06.479 --> 00:43:08.479
Yeah.

00:43:08.479 --> 00:43:14.440
Do you understand what kind of picture that paints of Jesus?

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.919
Think about the ramifications.

00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:19.679
Listen, false teaching is so prevalent today.

00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:23.360
You type something in Google and you think the first results that pop up must be the

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.599
right ones.

00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:25.759
That's not always true.

00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:30.199
Those algorithms are not always in our best interest.

00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:35.880
It's beyond my ability how they can process nine million websites as quickly as they can

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.440
and all that they do to provide you with the results that they provide you with.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.800
But I would tell you that they're not, the first one that pops up isn't always the right

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800
one.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.160
You can't believe everything you see on the Internet.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.000
You can't believe every YouTube preacher.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I don't care how many followers they have.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
God's Word exposes false teaching.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.160
You can't believe the guy that has the biggest church.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.360
And I'm not saying that all of those people are false teachers.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.279
I'm simply saying we must be careful.

00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:12.119
We must be careful, because false teachers, they exist, they're exposed by God's Word.

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:15.479
And then the emphasis is placed on sound doctrine.

00:44:15.479 --> 00:44:24.519
As we continue, we must continue with the knowledge that doctrine matters.

00:44:24.519 --> 00:44:30.040
Because we have to continue in a manner in which is pleasing to God.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.679
God didn't just say continue and continue however you want.

00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:37.000
No, continue and here's the path to continue on.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.160
Continue carries with it in my mind the concept, if you will, of making progress.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.600
But that progress is the right direction.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.799
You ever find somebody that's busy, but they're not busy doing what they're supposed to be

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:49.559
doing?

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:51.040
You know what I'm saying?

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.919
You find some people on the work site that seem like they work harder to get out of work

00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:58.919
than if they just work.

00:44:58.919 --> 00:45:01.320
No, no.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.040
He says we're to continue and he says doctrine matters.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.919
Turn over to Jude and we'll end there.

00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:10.720
Jude has one chapter.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:17.600
And I want you to see what Jude writes of.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:27.519
There is a great exposure of false teaching in this short letter, the short book of Jude.

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:32.440
Jude begins in verse number one.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.760
Jude the servant of Jesus Christ, by the way, it's a good title, to be the servant of Jesus

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.799
Christ.

00:45:39.799 --> 00:45:44.959
And brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ

00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:46.639
and called.

00:45:46.639 --> 00:45:49.519
Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.

00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:55.000
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.480
This is not common as in just it's a low quality or of little value.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.480
No, it's that they had common salvation amongst them.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.600
They were saved by the grace of God.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:13.040
He says, notice in verse number three, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.480
you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480
saints.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.480
So really, God allows Jude to express his heart in this book and say, I was planning

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.000
to write to you on this, but God said, no, this is needed.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.239
You know, as a pastor, I can relate to that.

00:46:32.239 --> 00:46:36.040
There are sometimes there's some messages I'd like to preach that are just kind of exhorting

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.279
kind of messages, and sometimes God says, no, we need this today, and I want to follow

00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:43.399
the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:46:43.399 --> 00:46:49.600
I shared with you a study that we did on Wednesday evening on Psalm 143 at the end of last year.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.040
I didn't know why God led me there.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.679
I was desiring to go a completely different way.

00:46:53.679 --> 00:46:58.040
It was amazing after that study, actually in the midst of that study, there were a number

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.079
of people that came and said, I needed this.

00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:02.279
God knows that.

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:05.200
I'm not smart enough to figure that out.

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:09.959
But God knows, and Jude says, I was desiring to write on this.

00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:14.000
This is what I planned to write on, but it was needful for me to write unto you and to

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.279
exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered on

00:47:19.279 --> 00:47:20.279
the saints.

00:47:20.279 --> 00:47:21.279
Why?

00:47:21.279 --> 00:47:24.559
Verse four, for there are certain men crept in.

00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:27.200
Do you notice that word unawares?

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.600
You know what's interesting about false teachers?

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.440
They don't come in and say, hey, I'm a false teacher.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.160
They don't have a banner that they carry, there's no sign on their forehead or on their

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.079
back that says, I'm a false teacher.

00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:41.799
No, they come in unawares.

00:47:41.799 --> 00:47:43.579
You know what happens often with these false teachers?

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:47.359
They try to use the same kind of terminology that you'll use.

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:53.919
I've said this before, that false teachers use our vocabulary but not our dictionary.

00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:55.100
They'll use the same words.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.919
You talk to somebody about being born again, they'll need something totally different.

00:47:57.919 --> 00:47:59.480
Oh yeah, I was born again, I was baptized.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.679
No, no, no, that's not being born again.

00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:02.679
Amen?

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.600
That's not the Bible definition of being born again.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.919
And so we see that it says that they've crept in unawares who were before of old ordained

00:48:10.919 --> 00:48:16.239
to the condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and

00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:22.799
denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:29.880
So Jude writes that these brethren would earnestly contend for the faith.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880
Why?

00:48:31.079 --> 00:48:33.559
Because doctrine matters.

00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:38.520
Faith that's mentioned here is really, it would encompass, if you will, that doctrine,

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520
right?

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.520
All of that teaching.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.919
And he says that we would earnestly contend for the faith.

00:48:44.919 --> 00:48:53.359
Not today as we look at the truth, not all men love the Lord.

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:56.000
There are some that are the enemies of the cross.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Now some are easy to identify, but some are not.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.159
And Paul says, Timothy, continue.

00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:11.400
God has equipped you, but here is the manner in which you must continue.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.400
Doctrine matters.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.760
We must remember that.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.799
As we go through this study this year, we must remember that in our own lives.

00:49:19.799 --> 00:49:25.239
We do not bend, we do not fold on what thus saith the Lord.

00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:28.880
You say, it's not popular anymore, Pastor.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.279
God's Word endures.

00:49:32.279 --> 00:49:35.159
God's Word stands.

00:49:35.159 --> 00:49:36.719
We want to have the right position.

00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:38.599
We want to have the right disposition.

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:41.659
We want to love people to Jesus.

00:49:41.659 --> 00:49:48.039
But the reality is that God's Word is plain and doctrine matters.

00:49:48.039 --> 00:49:49.039
Let's pray.

00:49:49.039 --> 00:49:50.039
Father, we love you.

00:49:50.039 --> 00:49:51.119
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:56.200
We thank you for the charge that was given to Timothy, and we thank you that after receiving

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.599
that charge and understanding how he'd been equipped, that there's an...

00:50:00.599 --> 00:50:06.039
exposure of these false teachers. There's an emphasis on sound doctrine. God, I pray

00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:13.119
that you would help us to be students of the Word, that we would study to show ourselves

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:17.539
approved. We'll see that as Paul writes to Timothy. I pray that you'd help us to know

00:50:17.539 --> 00:50:22.639
how we ought to behave ourselves. We see that again as Paul writes to Timothy in the house

00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:29.239
of God, understanding that it's the pillar and ground of the truth. God, help us to understand

00:50:29.239 --> 00:50:38.479
that doctrine matters. Help us to know thy Word. Help us, Lord, not to be alarmed by

00:50:38.479 --> 00:50:48.519
or worried about false teaching. Help us to simply be ground in the faith. Help us to

00:50:48.519 --> 00:50:56.719
be students of your Word. God, I pray that as we, as individuals, seek to live our lives

00:50:56.719 --> 00:51:01.599
to please you and to continue, Lord, I pray that you'd help us to understand that doctrine

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:09.079
matters. Help us to be careful of the books that we read, of the websites that we visit,

00:51:09.079 --> 00:51:17.559
of the messages that we listen to. Lord, help us to prove, to try the spirits, to prove

00:51:17.559 --> 00:51:26.399
all things, Lord, to understand that doctrine matters. I pray that you would move and work

00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:31.759
in hearts and lives, Lord. We spoke about the purpose of the law, to expose sin. It

00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:37.479
condemns. It cannot give life. It simply reveals that we're guilty. But it points us to the

00:51:37.479 --> 00:51:43.919
one, the only one, the Lord Jesus Christ that can give life. God, I pray that if there's

00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:48.239
one present this morning that's never been saved, God, I pray that you'd move and work

00:51:48.239 --> 00:51:53.559
in their heart, Lord. Draw them to yourself. I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convince

00:51:53.559 --> 00:51:58.159
them of their sin of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. I pray that in a

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:01.799
moment of invitation, Lord, this morning that we would be doers of the word and not hearers

00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:09.119
only. Help us, Lord, to make that commitment to be students of the word, to know doctrine,

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:15.319
to be settled and grounded in the faith. Well, thank you for each decision that's made. For

00:52:15.319 --> 00:52:16.559
it's in Christ's name we pray.
