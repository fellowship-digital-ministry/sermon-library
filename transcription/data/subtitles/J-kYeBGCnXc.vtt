WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
the righteous to be moved and what a blessing.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.039
Thank you, Deborah, Pierre and Kimberly.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.739
Greatly appreciate your assistance

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.039
with the special music this morning.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.279
And thanks to Jared for leading.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.220
And did you know that second song

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.779
or you learned it this morning?

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.379
Learned it this morning, amen.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:20.420
Just along with me, I'm happy I didn't mess you up too much.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.860
And I'm thankful that we have a savior.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm thankful that we have an anchor.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm thankful as we sang that last congregational hymn

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.540
and then being mindful of our savior

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.659
has invited us to cast all of our care on him.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:38.500
Why?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.259
Because he cares, careth for us.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.779
And we know that, we understand that truth.

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:43.740
And thank you.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.540
What a blessing to see how those songs all fit together.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.700
Hebrews chapter number five this morning.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.580
Hebrews chapter number five.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.259
We'll be looking at the first 10 verses

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.060
of Hebrews chapter number five.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.919
And let me just mention this as we even,

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:59.880
before we get into the message this morning,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.200
the passage of scripture that is before us.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.560
Of course, we've been studying

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.680
through the book of Hebrews here in 2020.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.760
We've taken the last several weeks off

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.839
because of the pandemic and all that's been going on.

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:15.160
And of course, preaching some various portions of scripture.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.059
But as we make our way back to the book of Hebrews

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:18.760
and come to this fifth chapter,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.000
these 10 verses in Hebrews chapter number five

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.760
are so important.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.540
We find that they are foundational

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.739
for that which will be further developed

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:33.339
in Hebrews seven, eight, nine, and 10.

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:34.940
And you think about 10 verses

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.699
and just the importance of these 10 verses.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.739
Of course, we understand that all of God's word

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.099
is important, but as we look at the foundation

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.660
that will be laid here in these 10 verses

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.580
and then further developed in chapter seven through 10,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.139
it is extremely important that we understand

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.639
the content of what we are given here

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.879
in Hebrews five verses one through 10.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.360
If you're like my children, you say,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.319
well, what about the rest of chapter five and chapter six?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.319
And you'll remember as we've studied

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.319
through the book of Hebrews,

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.720
I was chatting with them this morning before the service,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
and you'll remember that as we've studied

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440
through the book of Hebrews,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.800
that there have been warning passages.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.520
And we will find that there's instruction given

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.800
and then there's a warning passage,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500
instruction giving a warning passage.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.240
Well, beginning in verse number 11 of chapter five

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.660
and going through the sixth chapter

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.740
is such a passage of a warning type of a passage.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.979
And so this foundational truth in Hebrews five

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.820
verses one through 10 is of significant importance

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.380
as we would understand that which is given

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.860
in chapter seven through 10.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.300
Now, if you have been with us

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.899
as we've studied the book of Hebrews,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.279
we understand that the writer is presenting

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.979
the Lord Jesus Christ as being superior.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.779
And he is, he's superior for a whole list of reasons

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.399
and we've gone through several of those

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.199
as we've studied the book of Hebrews.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.259
We found that in Hebrews chapter number one,

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.000
that Christ is superior to the prophets.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.199
Remember, he's writing to those

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.360
that have trusted Christ as their savior,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.279
but these Jewish people that he's writing to,

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:08.559
this book of Hebrews, the initial recipients of this book,

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.240
very familiar with, of course, because of their culture

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.320
and their lineage, their heritage,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.720
he's speaking to them on matters

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.919
in which they would easily, quickly be able

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.220
to identify with the prophets.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.179
Of course, they'd be very familiar with the prophets

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.460
and he says, but Christ is superior to the prophets.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.320
We find that he then moves into the fact

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.899
that Christ is superior to the angels

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.979
and they would have had a level of knowledge

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.860
with regard to various portions of scripture

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.619
regarding the work of angels and what have you,

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.600
but Christ is superior to the angels.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.539
We found in Hebrews chapter number three,

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.899
that Christ is superior to Moses.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.360
Now, really kind of hitting home, if you will,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.960
because Moses was held in high regard

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.860
between Moses and Abraham,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.000
two of the probably most highly regarded folks

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.839
in the Old Testament.

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.880
Of course, David would be in there as well,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.479
but we find that there were many references

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.919
during the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.139
where they would speak about the religious leaders,

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.800
about Moses, about Abraham,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.520
and so we find here that Christ is superior to Moses.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.279
There have been a few glimpses of the truth

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.040
that will be given to us in chapter number five.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.440
In chapter number two, again in chapter number four,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.359
there's been some glimpses of what will be developed here

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:29.559
in these 10 verses and then further explained

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:31.299
in chapter seven through 10,

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:36.239
and that truth is that Jesus Christ in his priesthood,

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.739
he is the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ,

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.700
and really that's what we begin to see

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.100
in these 10 verses of Hebrews five.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.820
Just to remind you of what we've seen glimpses of

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.779
in chapter number two,

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.059
we found that in verse number 17,

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.899
the Bible says,

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.179
wherefore in all things it behooved him,

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:56.299
speaking of Christ,

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:58.739
to be made like unto his brethren,

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:03.260
that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.299
in things pertaining to God,

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.899
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.619
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted,

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:16.179
he is able to succor them that are tempted.

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.140
Again, in chapter number four in verses 14 and 15,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.220
we find the Bible says,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.980
seeing then that we have a great high priest

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.059
that is passed into the heavens,

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.820
Jesus, the son of God,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.160
let us hold fast our profession,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.839
for we have not an high priest

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:35.920
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.500
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.260
yet without sin.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.019
Let us therefore come boldly under the thorn of grace

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.019
that we may obtain mercy

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.940
and find grace to help in time of need.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.940
These two passages in Hebrews two

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.540
and in Hebrews chapter number four

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.660
are giving us some glimpses

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.100
as to what is being developed here in chapter number five.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.059
If you're taking notes,

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.459
I've simply titled the message this morning,

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.339
our great high priest,

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.299
our great high priest.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.339
Notice with me in verse number one,

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.059
the Bible says for every high priest,

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.619
taken from among men is ordained for men

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.700
in things pertaining to God,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.299
that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:20.299
Who can have compassion on the ignorant

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:22.420
and on them that are out of the way,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.140
for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.420
And by reason hereof,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.700
he ought as for the people,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.899
so also for himself to offer for sins.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:37.899
And no man taketh this honor unto himself,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:41.500
but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.339
So also Christ glorified not himself

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:45.660
to be made an high priest,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.619
but he that said unto him,

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.420
thou art my son,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.380
this today have I begotten thee.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.220
As he said also in another place,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.019
thou art a priest forever

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.100
after the order of Melchizedek,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.660
who in the days of his flesh,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.940
when he had offered up prayers and supplications

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.019
with strong crying and tears

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:08.579
unto him that was able to save him from death

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.299
and was heard in that he feared.

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:13.779
Though he were a son yet learned the obedience

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.859
by the things which he suffered

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:17.459
and being made perfect,

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:19.420
he became the author of eternal salvation

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.459
to all them that obey him,

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:23.820
called of God and high priest

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.140
after the order of Melchizedek,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.899
our great high priest.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:30.220
We've discussed before

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.100
that Jesus Christ is prophet, priest, and king.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.899
And we understand that he fills those roles.

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:39.820
And we find here specifically

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.579
the role of priests being given to us.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:45.619
The important factor as we get into the lesson,

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:47.059
the message this morning,

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:48.619
is that these recipients,

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.459
these Jewish believers,

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:53.940
they would have had a solid understanding

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.459
of the Old Testament

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.260
and would have understood many aspects

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.140
regarding the priesthood.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.339
They're very familiar with it.

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:02.739
In fact, as we've mentioned,

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:04.420
through the study of the book of Hebrews,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.820
the temple is still in operation

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.739
at this time historically.

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.380
There are sacrifices that are still being made.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.059
All of the Jewish tradition, if you will,

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.660
if we could use that terminology,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.500
but all of that Old Testament sacrificial system,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.739
it was still going on.

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:22.179
They were suffering under persecution.

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:25.339
There was the thought of returning to Judaism.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.179
And we find that here,

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:28.859
throughout the book of Hebrews,

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:31.220
the call to the people

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.659
that are being addressed is not to return.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.500
Why?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.260
Because Christ is superior,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.820
that He is better,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.700
and that we need to go on.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.179
We need to go on to spiritual maturity.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.460
And really we see that in the next section,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.539
the warning section of the conclusion of chapter five

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:49.940
and all of chapter number six

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.020
on that truth of going on to spiritual maturity.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.059
And so as we understand some of these things

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:58.260
and have an understanding of what they,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.859
as the initial recipients,

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:01.159
would have understood,

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:03.760
we must make note of this truth

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.799
that the Old Testament was only a shadow

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.280
of good things to come.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.000
We find that in Hebrews chapter number 10

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.599
laid out extensively for us.

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:15.359
And what a joy to know that the types

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:18.719
and all of the prophecies of the Old Testament,

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:21.119
how they point to Messiah,

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:23.039
the Lord Jesus Christ who would come.

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:25.280
And of course, from our vantage point now,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.479
He has come and He's fulfilled the will of the Father.

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:32.559
And we understand that He was crucified.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.400
He was buried.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.719
He rose in victory.

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.039
He ascended to heaven.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:38.320
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.880
And one day, and I pray one day soon,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.640
He is coming back to receive us unto Himself.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.520
We've discussed thoroughly throughout

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.760
the first four chapters of the book of Hebrews,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.559
the incarnation of Christ,

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:53.559
that Jesus Christ became man,

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.320
but He never gave up His deity.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.919
He is the God, man.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.159
He's a hundred percent God, a hundred.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:05.239
man, we've dealt with his deity, we've addressed the incarnation, we've addressed

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:10.759
those many subjects that are given to us. We've spoken because of the passage of

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:14.479
Scripture at the end of chapter 1 and much of chapter number 2 with regard to

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:18.119
Christ being superior to the angels. There were some that say, yeah, but he was

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:22.659
made a little lower than the angels, and the answers are given to us as to why

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:28.999
that is, because he had to come not in that manner as an angel. See, an angel

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:33.799
could not die for the sins of mankind, and he says specifically in chapter 2 and

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:38.159
verse number 1, excuse me, verse 16, for verily he took not on him the nature of

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:43.159
angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Why? So that he could make

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:49.239
reconciliation for the sins of the people. And what a joy to understand that

00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:54.079
which has been accomplished through the incarnation of our Lord and Savior Jesus

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:59.639
Christ. He is God, a hundred percent God, but for that period of time he took on

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:04.679
humanity, he took on human flesh. Why? So that he could die in our place, but

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:09.279
pertaining to that which we see with regard to the priesthood, we find that

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:15.079
there are other indications with regard to that which he was able to, as we find

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:19.799
in chapter number 4 in verse 15, that he was tempted in all points yet without

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:23.719
sin, but we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of

00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:28.239
our infirmities. See, he took on that human form, yes, so that he could die for

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:34.279
our sins, but we find that he also suffered through those things that he

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:39.199
suffered. He then accomplished what nothing, what no other could ever

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:43.559
accomplish. As we get into the passage of Scripture, I want you to notice, first of

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:47.279
all, the pattern of the Old Testament priest. In the first four verses of

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:52.319
Hebrews 5, we see that there's a pattern that is established in really giving the

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:56.919
Old Testament truth with regard to what they would have been familiar with. Many

00:11:56.919 --> 00:12:01.499
of us, as we have studied the Bible and read the Bible, we've read about the

00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:05.559
priest in the Old Testament, we have a level of understanding of the priesthood

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:09.399
and what-have-you, and so in these first four verses there's a pattern that is

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:15.319
discussed, and really we understand, as we look at the passage, their role. It's

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:19.679
mentioned to us in verse number 1, they are to represent man to God. It says

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:23.999
here, in verse number 1 of chapter 5, for every high priest taken from among men

00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:30.479
is ordained for men in things pertaining to God. Notice this, as we consider their

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:37.759
role, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, and we'd understand,

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:40.999
as we think about the pattern in the Old Testament, and understand he's speaking

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:45.119
about the high priest, obviously Aaron as the first high priest, and he's mentioned

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:49.759
in verse number 4, that they would go into the Holy of Holies on the Day of

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:54.079
Atonement, and they would make an offering, and that was not only an

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:57.999
offering for the sins of the people, but for their own sins, as we find in verse

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:02.399
number 3, but we find that this was their role. You could read the Old Testament,

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:06.759
you could read the system that's given to us in the book of Leviticus, with all

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:10.879
of the offerings and sacrifices and what-have-you, and there were gifts, there

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:14.479
were offerings that were brought, that were gifts, there were

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:18.799
sacrifices that were made, and we see that it's mentioned here in verse number

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:24.639
1, the role of this priest. Notice in verse number 2, we see that their

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:29.919
demeanor is mentioned. It says, who can have compassion on the ignorant and on

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:35.039
them that are out of the way, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity?

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:39.039
We think about their demeanor, that they were to be compassionate. It's

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:41.959
interesting as you would look at verse number 2 and see where it says, who can

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:46.039
have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way? In other

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:49.559
words, those that would be bringing the offerings, those that would be bringing

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:55.439
the sacrifices, that they would be able to be compassionate to them, to the

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:59.199
ones that are bringing, and then of course they would process the offering

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:03.679
and make the offering, but they had this demeanor. They were not to be judgmental.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:08.279
They were to be able to be compassionate and to relate to these individuals. It's

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:11.999
interesting as you study the Old Testament that not all were compassionate.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:17.399
Amen? Eli was very judgmental towards Hannah when she was praying, was he not?

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:21.999
He says that she's drunken, right? I mean, that was his immediate understanding.

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:26.279
There were some corrupt priests within the Old Testament system. We understand

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:30.119
that, and we see that taking place, but we find that the pattern that was

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:35.239
established, that what God's intent was, is that these men, notice in verse

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:40.439
number one, that their for every high peace taken from among men is

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:45.319
ordained for men, and they would be that representative to represent man to God,

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:49.839
to offer gifts and sacrifice, but to do it with compassion. See, it's easy for us

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:52.999
sometimes to be judgmental towards others that are dealing with sin and

00:14:52.999 --> 00:14:58.799
difficulty in their lives, and yet we need to be with compassion, be able to bring

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:02.959
them along and help them to see that victory is possible through the Lord

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:06.519
Jesus Christ. It's interesting as we make a parallel, and we'll get to it at

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:11.319
the end of the message today, but you understand this demeanor that it's

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:14.359
mentioned in verse number two, and it would be appropriate for us to once

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:18.079
again reference chapter number four and verse number 15, where the Bible says

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:23.039
that we have not, and a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:28.959
our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:33.719
And I'm so thankful that our God is compassionate. The Bible declares to us

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:38.559
that he is a compassionate God. During the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:43.199
Christ, you find many references where the Bible says that he, Jesus, was moved

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:49.359
with compassion, and what a joy to know that our Savior is a compassionate

00:15:49.359 --> 00:15:53.279
Savior, and we think about this pattern that is being established as these

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:57.079
things are being set forth. Again, the foundation, the groundwork for which will

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:01.719
be developed in a greater sense in the next several chapters, we see their role,

00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:07.199
their demeanor, notice also their call. In verse number three, it says, and by reason

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.799
hereof, he all asked for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins,

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:14.719
dealing with those sacrifices that are mentioned in verse number one. It's

00:16:14.719 --> 00:16:18.959
important that we know, before we get to the call in verse number four, that they,

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:22.159
when they went in to make an atonement, they had to atone for their own sins,

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:28.279
then for the sins of the people. And we find in verse number four, it says, and no

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:37.359
man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:42.079
And it's important that we understand this pattern. Why? Because we see how that

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:46.879
Jesus in his priesthood is superior, and we'll get to that in just a few moments,

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:50.959
but we notice the pattern that is established, and you see that it says, no

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:54.719
man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God. It wasn't as if

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:57.999
somebody could come and say, hey, I volunteered to be a priest, let's have a

00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:00.959
vote, who's gonna be the high priest, okay? You put your name on the

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:05.599
ballot there, you put... it's not how it worked. In fact, if you were to go back,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.539
and we don't have the time really to develop all of this this morning, but if

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:14.279
you go back to the book of Exodus and you read chapters 28 and 29, you see

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:19.479
specifically where God gave the direction to Moses to go to his brother

00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:24.479
Aaron and to establish him as the high priest. We find the consecration in

00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:29.599
chapter number 29 from the head to the feet, right? I mean, fully

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:36.119
consecrated to the work that God would give him. We find that later in the Word

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:40.759
of God, you see that in Exodus 28 and 29, with Aaron specifically being selected or

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:46.959
chosen, that you then come to Numbers chapters 3 and 4, and you see that it's

00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:52.639
the tribe of Levi that is established as the tribe in which the priest would

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:56.879
come from. If you are not from the tribe of Levi, you weren't going to be a

00:17:56.879 --> 00:18:01.839
priest. And even if you were from the tribe of Levi, but one of the

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:06.199
other sons was your lineage, then you weren't going to be a priest, you would

00:18:06.199 --> 00:18:10.279
serve in some other capacity. And it's interesting to note, because there are

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:15.559
references in the Old Testament, I'll just use two this morning, to reference

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:22.079
those that sought to fulfill the office of priest when they weren't supposed to.

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:28.079
The first reference would be in Numbers chapter 17 with Korah. Many of us are

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:31.799
familiar with that. Numbers chapter 16, excuse me. And you see in Numbers chapter

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:39.159
16 there with Korah, and they were of the tribe of Levi, but they had been given

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:45.159
specific roles to fulfill. The Kohathites there, the sons of Korah, but they

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:49.679
wanted to do the work of the priest. And there was some rebellion that took place

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:55.119
in Numbers 16, and something amazing happens. The earth opens up and swallows

00:18:55.119 --> 00:19:02.619
them up. The judgment of God, right? Why? Because Korah was not ordained of God to

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:07.799
be a priest, to serve in that capacity. In the book of 2 Chronicles, in chapter

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:13.799
number 26, the Bible tells us about Uzziah. Now Uzziah was a king. Kings didn't

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:18.199
come from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Judah. We find that Uzziah was a king,

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:24.959
and as a king he could not fulfill the office of priest. Again, we're looking at

00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:29.199
glimpses of our Savior being superior, and we'll deal with that as we move

00:19:29.199 --> 00:19:32.559
forward through the Scriptures this morning. But we find that Uzziah,

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:38.639
remember, God had blessed him, and God had helped him, and he was marvelously

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:44.359
helped, the Bible tells us, until he was strong and pride came in. And remember, he

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:50.299
goes in to offer. He tries to go in and do the work of a priest. The

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:55.719
priest, they came in and they withstood him. It's not for you, Uzziah. And what

00:19:55.719 --> 00:20:00.959
happened? Leprosy. God's judgment.

00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:07.119
So we see that here, as it says, this was not a situation where men would volunteer,

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:12.079
individuals would volunteer. No, no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:18.799
of God. Then it says, as was Aaron. It's interesting, after the situation in Numbers 16,

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:25.439
with the Korah and the sons of Korah and all of that that takes place, in Numbers 17, God

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:30.879
records for us how the Aaron's rod budded. Do you guys remember? You remember the text

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:34.999
of Scripture, and you remember the proof, the evidence, if you will, when they took

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:41.239
and they took all of those rods, and it was going to be a sign from God that the one whose

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:46.919
rod would bud was the one that would fill that office, and it was Aaron's rod that budded.

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:52.999
And we find that as this pattern is established, this pattern in the Old Testament of the priests,

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:58.599
the Levitical priesthood, that these recipients would have had a knowledge and understanding

00:20:58.599 --> 00:21:05.039
of these things. We find that there's a, number two if you're taking notes, the prophecy

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:10.119
of a greater priest. So there's a pattern of the priesthood, the Levitical priesthood,

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:16.979
but then there's a prophecy of a greater priest. We find that as we have on many occasion already

00:21:16.979 --> 00:21:23.899
through the book of Hebrews, we have found that the writer of Hebrews will use Old Testament

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:29.979
passages and then properly apply those to the person of Jesus Christ. We find that that's

00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:34.979
exactly what he's going to do here once again. Again, these individuals would have had a

00:21:34.979 --> 00:21:40.439
good working knowledge of the Old Testament. They would have understood many of these things.

00:21:40.439 --> 00:21:45.179
Most of them would have understood many of these things, and as the writer has gone through

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:50.099
this process, and we understand all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and how appropriate

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:56.939
to see how God would use these Old Testament prophecies and show, here's the proper fulfillment

00:21:56.939 --> 00:22:03.979
in the Lord Jesus Christ. These prophecies are properly applied to the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:11.499
and we find the first one given to us in Hebrews 5, in verse number 5. Notice, so also Christ

00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:16.339
glorified not himself to be made in high priest. You see the continuation of verse

00:22:16.339 --> 00:22:20.859
number 4. These guys didn't volunteer for it, and it's saying that what he's looking

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:26.139
at is this call, the plan of the Father. He says, but he that said unto him, notice the

00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:34.099
end of verse number 5, thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. This is a verse that

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:38.579
was used back in Hebrews chapter number 1 as well, in verse number 5 when the Bible

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:43.339
promises for unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son, this day

00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:48.419
have I begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son,

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:53.259
and we find that this verse from the Old Testament is none other than the book of Psalms, Psalm

00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:58.219
chapter number 2 and verse number 7. As we would consider the Old Testament passage of

00:22:58.219 --> 00:23:04.139
Scripture in Psalm 2 and verse number 7, we must be mindful of the fact that when the

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:10.739
Scripture says, thou art my son, today or this day have I begotten thee, that he was

00:23:10.739 --> 00:23:19.339
not referring to the birth of Christ. Many people inappropriately or wrongfully interpret

00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:24.779
that to think that he's speaking of the birth of Christ as incarnation. No, the Scriptures

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:28.939
as you study Scripture with Scripture, you compare Scripture with Scripture, you find

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:35.139
that what he's speaking about is not the birth of Christ, but the resurrection of Christ.

00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:40.419
In Acts chapter number 13, notice as the Apostle Paul is preaching, in Acts chapter number

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:45.499
13, turn over there with me quickly if you will, and this is the first missionary journey

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:50.699
he's going. The Apostle Paul's been sent out of the church at Antioch and he's preaching,

00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:54.419
and they're on this first missionary journey in the regions of Galatia, and he's preaching

00:23:54.419 --> 00:24:00.179
the Word of God. You'll remember that as he first arrives to Antioch and Pisidia, as

00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:06.819
it's given to us in verse number 14, that they go there on the Sabbath day to the synagogue,

00:24:06.819 --> 00:24:11.179
and as they are there, they say this at the end of verse 15,

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:16.379
"...Ye men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."

00:24:16.379 --> 00:24:20.539
And Paul says, here's my opportunity, I'm going to preach, and he does. He preaches

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:25.459
the Word of God. Notice verse 16, "...Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand..."

00:24:25.459 --> 00:24:29.419
That's why I use my hands when I preach, amen? He said, "...Men of Israel, and ye that fear

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:34.739
God, give audience." And he begins to go through this message. I want you to notice, we don't

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:39.859
have time to look at all of it, but go down to verse number 33. He had gone through in

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:47.099
verses 28, down through verse number 32, he's dealing with the death, burial, and resurrection

00:24:47.099 --> 00:24:53.659
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and he says in verse number 33, "...God hath fulfilled

00:24:53.659 --> 00:25:02.659
the same unto us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus again, as it is also written

00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:09.659
in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee." So obviously the

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:16.419
prophecy of Psalm 2 is with regard to the resurrection, not the birth. And we find that

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:21.139
as we go back to the book of Hebrews, and we deal with Hebrews 5, in verse number 5,

00:25:21.139 --> 00:25:27.539
we find that the writer of Hebrews, he's referring back to a prophecy in the Old Testament, and

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:33.539
he's appropriately applying it to the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, he's got, now think about

00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:40.299
as we're reading this, we look at the pattern of the priesthood, then we look at this prophecy,

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:44.619
we come to Psalm 2 in verse number 7, that's referenced here in Hebrews 5 in verse number

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:50.219
5, oh yes, speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ. And then he goes to verse number 6,

00:25:50.219 --> 00:25:57.659
and he's going to reference another Old Testament prophecy. As he saith also in another place,

00:25:57.659 --> 00:26:05.899
that other place is Psalm 110 in verse number 4. Let me just make a note on Psalm 110, it

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:14.259
was commonly understood and agreed to by the religious leaders, the Jewish folks, that

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:21.979
Psalm 110 was categorized as a messianic psalm. Why is that important? Because the

00:26:21.979 --> 00:26:28.179
truth of Psalm 110 in verse number 4 is being applied here in Hebrews 5, 6, to the Lord

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:34.779
Jesus Christ. It's a messianic psalm, it points to Messiah, Christ is the Messiah, right?

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:40.899
Jesus is the Christ, that's what Paul preached, and proving that this man Jesus that you've

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:46.179
seen, that you've heard about, that you observed his life and you were aware of his death and

00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:52.419
his burial and his resurrection, he is the Christ, he is the Messiah, and this messianic

00:26:52.419 --> 00:26:59.699
psalm in Psalm 110 will now be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ when he says, thou art

00:26:59.699 --> 00:27:09.459
a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Now, we're familiar with the priesthood of

00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:15.139
Aaron, of the Levitical priesthood, and we've just mentioned several of those things, but

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:20.779
we find that there's an obvious change in direction that is given to us here with regard

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:27.939
to the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this is significant. Why is it significant?

00:27:27.939 --> 00:27:31.939
Because the Lord Jesus Christ, well, let me say this, as I mentioned a moment ago, priests

00:27:31.939 --> 00:27:38.419
came from the tribe of Levi. Jesus was not of the tribe of Levi. He was of the tribe

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:48.419
of Judah. So, he could not be a priest under the Levitical priesthood. It's not possible.

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:54.699
But he is prophet, priest, and king. By the way, the priest couldn't be a king and the

00:27:54.699 --> 00:28:02.019
king couldn't be a priest under the Levitical priesthood, but our Savior is God. He is the

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:08.779
Lord God Omnipotent. He is prophet, priest, and king, and he's not under the order of

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:15.479
the Levitical priesthood, but he's under the order of the Melchizedek priesthood. Now,

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:21.259
this would go back to Genesis chapter number 14 and deal with those things that are mentioned

00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:27.339
there in verses 18 through 20. We will develop this a whole lot more in chapter number 7,

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:32.099
and I'm not going to get into it a whole bunch this morning just because of the fact that

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:37.339
chapter number 7 details it. Remember, this is the foundation that will be built upon

00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:43.859
in chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10. And so, what is said here is that this messianic psalm,

00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:49.379
the prophecy of a greater priest, is now, they say, listen, you're familiar with the

00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:54.859
pattern of the priesthood, but let me remind you of the prophecy of a greater priest, and

00:28:54.859 --> 00:29:01.899
he gives them the prophecy from Psalm 2, then from Psalm 110, referencing that Jesus is

00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:06.979
the fulfillment and that he would be a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. It's

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:14.139
mentioned again in verse number 10, called of God and high priest after the order of

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:19.179
Melchizedek. By the way, if you read Genesis chapter number 14 and you read the interaction

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:24.679
that is recorded there between Abraham and this one Melchizedek, he comes on the pages

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:30.299
of Scripture and he departs the pages of Scripture in obscurity. There are just a few verses

00:29:30.299 --> 00:29:34.779
of Scripture that are mentioned about this one Melchizedek. In fact, the references in

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:39.959
Hebrews give us far more information than what you even see in the book of Genesis.

00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:49.959
And what we find is that this man Melchizedek, he was both priest and king. And Jesus, his

00:29:49.959 --> 00:29:57.159
priesthood would be after the order of Melchizedek. Again, this is significant because of the

00:29:57.159 --> 00:30:01.159
understanding of these individuals, and now we're taking not only the pattern of the priesthood

00:30:01.159 --> 00:30:01.159


00:30:01.159 --> 00:30:03.899
but now we're establishing the priesthood

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:06.899
through the prophecy that was given in the Old Testament.

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:10.359
It's interesting, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:14.159
and we find that the author, the writer of Hebrews,

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:16.659
as he systematically goes through this process,

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.399
he has given them the pattern and the prophecy.

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:23.539
And once those two things are understood,

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:26.739
he then presents the Lord Jesus Christ

00:30:26.739 --> 00:30:29.039
as the fulfillment of the prophecy

00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:32.359
and proves that He is superior.

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:33.199
It's awesome.

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:37.239
He takes and he says, let me give you the pattern,

00:30:37.239 --> 00:30:38.719
let me give you the prophecy,

00:30:38.719 --> 00:30:41.199
now let me present to you the Lord Jesus Christ

00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:45.439
and let me prove to you that He is superior.

00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:46.919
It says in verse number seven,

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:49.079
who in the days of His flesh,

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.799
you understand that in verse number seven,

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:53.419
He'd begin to speak about His earthly ministry.

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:55.419
And we can read in the Gospel records

00:30:55.419 --> 00:30:58.559
about the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:01.119
And it says, when He had offered up prayers

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:04.279
and supplications with strong crying and tears

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.999
unto Him that was able to save Him from death

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:09.459
and was heard and that He feared.

00:31:09.459 --> 00:31:11.299
Let me make a note on verse number seven.

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:14.919
There are many references in the Gospel record, excuse me,

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:18.399
to the prayer ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:20.319
And some have asked the question, if He's God,

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:21.959
why does He have to pray?

00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:24.039
Because He is God.

00:31:24.039 --> 00:31:26.119
The reality is that He is God,

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:27.919
He never ceased to be God,

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.119
but He also left us an example

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:31.999
that we should follow His steps.

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.959
The Bible tells us that in the book of Peter, 1 Peter,

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:38.359
and we find that Jesus was the perfect example.

00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:39.759
And He gave us an example.

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:42.679
It's interesting to know that it were the disciples

00:31:42.679 --> 00:31:45.979
that came to Jesus after they had observed Him praying

00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:50.599
and said this, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:53.199
They would not ask to be taught to pray

00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:56.579
if Jesus Himself was not engaged in prayer.

00:31:56.579 --> 00:31:58.339
Yes, He is one with the Father.

00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:01.319
He is God, but He left an example

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.679
that we should follow His steps.

00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:04.459
There are a few occasions in which you find

00:32:04.459 --> 00:32:06.339
in the Word of God, three in fact,

00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:09.019
in which Jesus is praying and He cries.

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:12.139
He weeps at the grave of Lazarus.

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:15.539
You see the compassion of the heart of Jesus.

00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:17.179
He knew what He was going to do,

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:20.139
but He has that compassion for Mary and Martha.

00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:21.739
And of course, He weeps there.

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.779
The Bible says Jesus wept.

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:27.899
We find that He wept over Jerusalem.

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:30.019
He wept over the city.

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:33.259
And then we find that He wept in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:35.239
I believe the reference here in verse number seven

00:32:35.239 --> 00:32:37.659
would be to that time in which He prayed

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:39.119
in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:41.059
I want you to understand that the Bible says

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.739
that with tears unto Him that was able to save Him

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:47.019
from death and was heard and that He feared.

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:49.979
Understand as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:32:49.979 --> 00:32:52.779
that Jesus was not praying in the garden

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:56.219
as you read the records in the Gospels.

00:32:56.219 --> 00:33:00.379
He was not praying that He would have to avoid death.

00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:02.899
No, no, Jesus knew that's why He came.

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:04.979
He was born to die.

00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:07.539
Remember, He says as He makes the great declaration

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:08.779
in John chapter number 10,

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:10.219
I am the Good Shepherd.

00:33:10.219 --> 00:33:11.419
And as the Good Shepherd,

00:33:11.419 --> 00:33:14.899
I laid down my life for the sheep.

00:33:14.899 --> 00:33:17.659
He says in chapter number 17 of the book of John,

00:33:17.659 --> 00:33:19.619
the hour is come.

00:33:19.659 --> 00:33:22.779
He knew that He was going to the cross of Calvary

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:26.499
and He went willingly because He loved us

00:33:26.499 --> 00:33:29.259
and He understood that it required that sacrifice

00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:33.299
to be made so that mankind could be redeemed.

00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:35.019
And we find that He was not praying

00:33:35.019 --> 00:33:37.059
that death would pass from Him

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:38.959
in the sense that He did not want to go

00:33:38.959 --> 00:33:40.579
to the cross of Calvary,

00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:44.139
but we find that I believe as you find many,

00:33:44.139 --> 00:33:45.639
many prophecies in the Old Testament,

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:47.139
the greatest one is Psalm 22

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:48.939
with regard to the crucifixion.

00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:51.699
See, Jesus had to die on a cross.

00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:54.179
It's the fulfillment of prophecy.

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:57.179
And we find that I believe as He was there in the garden,

00:33:57.179 --> 00:34:01.379
as He was sweating those great drops of blood

00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:02.699
and all that was taking place,

00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:05.419
I believe that there was a great spiritual battle

00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:07.099
that was taking place.

00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:08.859
Saint was trying to kill Jesus

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:11.819
before He'd ever get to the cross.

00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:14.819
Not only would He be spared death in the garden

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.419
so that He could go to the cross,

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:19.059
but then on the third day as we celebrate it last week,

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:20.619
He's gonna rise in victory,

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:24.179
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.339
We find that it says here,

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:27.739
though He were a son in verse number eight,

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.539
yet learned the obedience by the things which He suffered.

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:33.259
And it's interesting as you would understand

00:34:33.259 --> 00:34:36.579
verse number eight in light of what we've been told already

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:39.339
in chapter number four and verses 14 and 15

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:43.139
in understanding the way in which He's able to help us

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.259
and the things that He understands.

00:34:44.259 --> 00:34:46.819
Remember in chapter number two,

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:49.019
as we mentioned in verses 17 and 18,

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:52.379
He came, it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren,

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.979
yes, so that He could make reconciliation

00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:55.259
for the sins of the people,

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:57.559
but also He suffered being tempted,

00:34:57.559 --> 00:35:01.219
He's able to succor them that are tempted.

00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:04.139
We find that there were lessons that He learned

00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:06.779
through the experience of humanity

00:35:06.779 --> 00:35:09.779
that He understood in His deity.

00:35:09.779 --> 00:35:12.419
He understood because He is God,

00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:14.119
He has all knowledge,

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:18.439
but yet in His experience in that human flesh,

00:35:18.439 --> 00:35:21.399
He's able to, or He did I should say,

00:35:21.399 --> 00:35:26.239
learn things that He's then able to succor us, help us.

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:29.079
He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities.

00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:32.239
This is amazing, He's God,

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:36.319
but yet there were things that experientially He learned

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.679
through His earthly ministry

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:39.439
and the things that He suffered

00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:42.779
so that He could be our great high priest.

00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:44.619
Verse number nine, notice it says,

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:45.939
in being made perfect,

00:35:45.939 --> 00:35:49.179
you understand that this does not in any way, shape,

00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:52.199
or form lead anyone to come to the conclusion

00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:55.939
that He was not perfect, He is God.

00:35:55.939 --> 00:35:57.499
The word means complete,

00:35:57.499 --> 00:36:00.739
meaning in other words that He fulfilled

00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:02.899
that which He was sent to do.

00:36:02.899 --> 00:36:07.539
He said, I have finished the work in John 17.

00:36:07.539 --> 00:36:10.559
He completed what He was sent here to do,

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:13.919
the mission that He had upon the earth,

00:36:13.919 --> 00:36:16.639
He completed, and it says that He became

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:20.839
the author of eternal salvation

00:36:20.839 --> 00:36:22.979
unto all them that obey Him.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:26.679
I'm thankful for eternal salvation.

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.979
By the way, in a few weeks, we'll get to chapter number six

00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:31.959
where people like to say that you can lose your salvation.

00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.999
It'd be interesting that at the end of chapter five,

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:36.599
He would say that He's the author of eternal salvation,

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:38.199
and then in the very next section say,

00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:39.999
you can lose your salvation.

00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:41.919
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense,

00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:43.879
and I'll develop that in greater detail

00:36:43.879 --> 00:36:45.599
as we get to chapter number six,

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:48.399
but we find here that He became the author

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:50.839
of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him.

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:52.239
What does it mean by obeying Him?

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:55.399
Obeying the gospel, believing that what He said is true.

00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:57.599
We sang this morning, trust and obey,

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:01.879
obeying the gospel that Christ is indeed God,

00:37:01.879 --> 00:37:03.719
that He died according to the scriptures,

00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:05.239
that He was buried according to the scriptures,

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:08.319
that He rose again according to the scriptures,

00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:12.079
and what a blessing to have that eternal salvation,

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.359
the gift of God's eternal life,

00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:16.399
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:18.079
He's called of God and high priest

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.359
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:22.199
Now, I don't have much time, but you're at home, most of you,

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:24.439
and so we have a little extra time, amen,

00:37:24.439 --> 00:37:26.039
and I hope that you'll bear with me, why?

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:28.739
Because I wanna share with you, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:31.279
that He gives the pattern and the prophecy,

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:33.599
then He presents the Lord Jesus Christ

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.659
as being the fulfillment of the prophecy,

00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:37.939
but then proves that He's superior.

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:39.939
I wanna give you five reasons this morning

00:37:39.939 --> 00:37:43.279
that Christ's priesthood is superior

00:37:43.279 --> 00:37:45.299
to that of the Levitical priesthood,

00:37:45.299 --> 00:37:48.859
and as we think about these five truths this morning

00:37:48.859 --> 00:37:51.779
that would reveal to us His superiority,

00:37:51.779 --> 00:37:53.979
understand that as you stay with us

00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:55.779
over the next several weeks,

00:37:55.779 --> 00:37:59.099
these truths will be further developed

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:02.139
as we find in chapter seven, eight, nine, and 10,

00:38:02.139 --> 00:38:03.619
the development of these truths.

00:38:03.619 --> 00:38:06.819
In fact, as we go through these five points this morning,

00:38:06.819 --> 00:38:09.139
we will make reference to several verses

00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:13.459
within those chapters, and so let me say this, number one,

00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:17.139
five reasons that Christ's priesthood is superior.

00:38:17.139 --> 00:38:20.619
Number one, He passed through the heavens,

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:22.419
not simply through the veil.

00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:26.299
In the Old Testament, what happened with the priest,

00:38:26.299 --> 00:38:28.499
remember, he had to go and he made to go

00:38:28.499 --> 00:38:31.219
into the Holy of Holies, he had to pass through the veil,

00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:33.699
right, that separated the holy place

00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:35.619
from the Holy of Holies,

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:37.619
but we find that Jesus Christ,

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:40.179
He passed through the heavens.

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:43.179
Notice in chapter number four, in verse number 14,

00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:46.219
seeing then that we have a great high priest.

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:48.619
Now, let me make a statement, I didn't say this earlier,

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:50.419
but no high priest in the Old Testament

00:38:50.419 --> 00:38:53.500
was ever referred to as a great high priest.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.539
High priest, yes, but never great high priest.

00:38:56.539 --> 00:38:59.179
Jesus Christ is our great high priest.

00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:03.819
Notice it says this, that is passed into the heavens.

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:08.459
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:10.339
And so we see here in chapter number four,

00:39:10.339 --> 00:39:12.739
in verse number 14, that He's passed through the heavens.

00:39:12.739 --> 00:39:15.339
Notice in chapter number 10, in verse number 12,

00:39:15.339 --> 00:39:18.019
where the Bible tells us there with regard,

00:39:18.019 --> 00:39:19.819
and we'll mention this verse a couple of times

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:22.459
through this list, but in Hebrews 10, in verse number 12,

00:39:22.459 --> 00:39:24.019
the Bible says, but this man,

00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:27.059
after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:30.239
sat down on the right hand of God.

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:31.419
He passed through the heavens

00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:33.019
and He's in the throne room of God,

00:39:33.019 --> 00:39:34.859
even at this very moment.

00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:39.659
See, in the Old Testament, the Levitical priesthood,

00:39:39.659 --> 00:39:41.539
they could not pass through the heavens.

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:44.339
They were not in the throne room of God.

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:46.299
Yes, they were in that earthly place

00:39:46.299 --> 00:39:49.839
where God chose to show His presence,

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:52.739
to manifest His presence in the Old Testament.

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:55.899
Yes, in the tabernacle first, but then in the temple.

00:39:55.899 --> 00:39:57.859
But we find that in Hebrews chapter nine,

00:39:57.859 --> 00:39:59.699
is we would make a contrast.

00:39:59.699 --> 00:40:01.299
The Bible says this.

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:04.299
Speaking of the priest that went always, look in verse number six,

00:40:04.299 --> 00:40:06.679
now when these things were thus ordained,

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:12.139
the priest went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.

00:40:12.139 --> 00:40:13.939
That was in the holy place.

00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:17.699
They would go in there, and they would do the service of God.

00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:19.279
But notice in verse number seven,

00:40:19.279 --> 00:40:23.699
but into the second, what is he referring to? The Holy of Holies.

00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:26.039
Where the Ark of the Covenant was, the mercy seat, right?

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:28.499
He says that he goes into the second, look, it says this,

00:40:28.499 --> 00:40:31.079
but into the second went the high priest alone,

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:34.959
once every year, not without blood,

00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:39.379
which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people.

00:40:39.379 --> 00:40:42.259
So we find, number one, why is Christ's priesthood superior?

00:40:42.259 --> 00:40:44.879
Well, he passed through the heavens, not simply through the veil.

00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:51.219
Number two, his offering was for the sin of the world, but not for his own.

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:54.519
His offering was for the sin of the world, but not for his own.

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:56.479
See, he had no sin.

00:40:56.479 --> 00:41:00.319
He did not have to make an atonement for his sin first,

00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:01.939
and then for the sin of the people.

00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:05.599
No, he could never be our Savior if he was sinful.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:11.639
He had no sin, and therefore his offering was an offering for the sin of the world.

00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:16.779
We notice here, again, in chapter number four and verse number 15 of Hebrews,

00:41:16.779 --> 00:41:17.579
where the Bible says,

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:22.159
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,

00:41:22.159 --> 00:41:28.999
but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.

00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:31.559
2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 21,

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:35.559
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:39.239
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:41.979
1 Peter chapter 3 and verse number 18,

00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:44.819
where Peter says this about the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:50.579
for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust,

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:53.959
that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,

00:41:53.959 --> 00:41:56.999
but quickened by the Spirit.

00:41:56.999 --> 00:42:00.459
See, this was in contrast to the Levitical priesthood.

00:42:00.459 --> 00:42:04.439
We found, as we mentioned in verse number 3 of Hebrews chapter number 5,

00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:07.819
that when they would go in to make these sacrifices for sins,

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:09.019
notice in verse number 3,

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:12.799
and by reason hereof he ought as for the people,

00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:17.399
so also for himself to offer for sins.

00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:20.239
We read already in Hebrews 9 and verse number 7,

00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:23.819
where the Bible says that he could only go into the Holy of Holies once every year,

00:42:23.819 --> 00:42:27.699
not without blood, which he offered for himself

00:42:27.699 --> 00:42:30.139
and for the errors of the people.

00:42:30.139 --> 00:42:34.739
See, Christ's priesthood is superior because his offering was for the sin of the world,

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:37.939
but not for his own sin, because he had no sin.

00:42:37.939 --> 00:42:40.579
Number 3, why is Christ's priesthood superior?

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:44.379
Because he conquered death and lives forever.

00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:49.059
The duration of his priesthood we mentioned in verse number 6 of Hebrews 5,

00:42:49.059 --> 00:42:53.459
where the Bible tells us that thou art a priest forever,

00:42:53.499 --> 00:42:55.259
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.339
We found in verse number 9 that the Bible says

00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:02.499
that he became the author of eternal salvation.

00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:04.939
In chapter number 7, in verse number 25,

00:43:04.939 --> 00:43:08.779
speaking of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, our great High Priest,

00:43:08.779 --> 00:43:11.059
the Bible says in that verse of Scripture,

00:43:11.059 --> 00:43:14.419
wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost

00:43:14.419 --> 00:43:16.139
that come unto God by him,

00:43:16.139 --> 00:43:20.939
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

00:43:20.939 --> 00:43:24.339
Remember, as we read the passage of Scripture from the book of Revelation

00:43:24.339 --> 00:43:26.779
last week on Sunday morning to begin our message,

00:43:26.779 --> 00:43:29.579
and we noticed in Revelation 1, in verse number 18,

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:33.659
where Jesus said, I am he that liveth and was dead,

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:38.299
and behold, I am alive forevermore.

00:43:38.299 --> 00:43:42.819
We find that this is not the case for the Old Testament Levitical priesthood.

00:43:42.819 --> 00:43:45.659
If we think about the order of the Levitical priesthood,

00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:48.419
we understand that they died, right?

00:43:48.419 --> 00:43:50.299
Chapter number 7, in verse number 23,

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:52.019
and they truly were many priests

00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:57.099
because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death.

00:43:57.099 --> 00:43:59.659
It's interesting, side note, if you study the Old Testament,

00:43:59.659 --> 00:44:01.499
and we'll get there eventually in the book of Joshua,

00:44:01.499 --> 00:44:05.859
if you're with us for our Joshua series on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:07.979
But as we go through that series, eventually,

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:09.779
and I don't know how long from now,

00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:12.459
but eventually we'll get to the cities of refuge.

00:44:12.459 --> 00:44:13.979
It's interesting about the cities of refuge,

00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:15.539
I'll make a reference to it this evening

00:44:15.539 --> 00:44:17.619
as I preach through Genesis chapter number 9,

00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:20.739
the first seven verses tonight of that passage of Scripture,

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:22.699
and I'll make a reference to the cities of refuge,

00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:26.940
though we won't deal with it in entirety,

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.659
but we do find that the cities of refuge,

00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:30.339
when someone went to a city of refuge,

00:44:30.339 --> 00:44:33.259
he had to stay there until the death of a high priest.

00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:35.059
Then he could return.

00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:39.099
See, but our priest, our great high priest, he conquered death.

00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:40.779
He lives forever.

00:44:40.779 --> 00:44:43.179
His priesthood is superior.

00:44:43.179 --> 00:44:49.899
Number four, he made one offering for sin forever.

00:44:49.899 --> 00:44:53.099
See, the Bible tells us as we would consider this truth,

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:56.459
and I mentioned already in Hebrews 10 and verse number 12 where the Bible says,

00:44:56.459 --> 00:45:00.459
but this man, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever,

00:45:00.459 --> 00:45:02.259
sat down on the right hand of God.

00:45:02.259 --> 00:45:07.059
See, that's the priesthood of our great high priest,

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:09.500
the Lord Jesus Christ after the order of Melchizedek,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.059
as we'll mention here in just a moment,

00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:14.139
but we find that he made one offering for sin forever.

00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:17.619
That was not the case under the Levitical order.

00:45:17.619 --> 00:45:20.739
The Bible actually begins in chapter number 10 and verse number 1,

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:22.859
as I referenced this verse of Scripture

00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:24.859
in the very beginning of the message this morning,

00:45:24.859 --> 00:45:29.099
for the law having a shadow of good things to come,

00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:31.099
and not the very image of the things,

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:34.500
can never with those sacrifices, notice this phrase,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:40.059
which they offered year by year continually,

00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:42.619
to make the comers thereunto perfect.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:46.500
For then would they not have ceased to be offered?

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.220
In other words, if they could accomplish in their offering

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.419
what Christ accomplished in one offering,

00:45:51.419 --> 00:45:53.819
why'd they have to keep bringing it every year?

00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:56.019
Because the blood of bulls and goats, notice,

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:58.899
as we continue here in the passage of Scripture in verse number 4,

00:45:58.899 --> 00:46:04.139
it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.

00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:09.940
We find that Jesus Christ, one sacrifice for sin forever.

00:46:09.979 --> 00:46:12.019
His priesthood is superior, number one,

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:14.739
because he passed through the heavens, not simply through the veil.

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:17.339
Number two, his offering was for the sin of the world,

00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:19.779
but not for his own, because he had no sin.

00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:23.179
Number three, he conquered death and lives forever.

00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:25.779
Number four, he made one offering for sin forever.

00:46:25.779 --> 00:46:29.940
And number five, his priesthood is after the order of Melchizedek.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.699
Again, I mentioned several things about that during the message this morning,

00:46:33.699 --> 00:46:37.979
as we dealt with the prophecy that is given in verses 6 and verse number 10.

00:46:37.979 --> 00:46:41.739
And we find that the truths of this passage of Scripture

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:45.899
will be developed in great detail as we come to chapter number 7.

00:46:45.899 --> 00:46:49.940
And really, much of the passage in chapter number 7 of the book of Hebrews

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.299
deals with that very truth of the priesthood of Melchizedek

00:46:54.299 --> 00:46:56.459
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:59.339
Jesus is not of the tribe of Levi.

00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:01.259
He's of the tribe of Judah.

00:47:01.259 --> 00:47:06.859
He could not be a Levitical priest, but he's of a higher, greater priesthood.

00:47:06.859 --> 00:47:10.099
That's the order of Melchizedek.

00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:12.859
And for those five reasons, and there's probably more that we could give,

00:47:12.859 --> 00:47:19.539
but for five reasons to prove that Christ's priesthood is superior.

00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:24.099
Now, as we take all of this truth and understand that it's foundational

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:28.019
for what we will study in weeks to come, in chapters 7 through 10,

00:47:28.019 --> 00:47:31.940
I want you to be encouraged this morning by the very truth

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.940
that we have a great high priest.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.940
Jesus, the Son of God, and He is our Savior.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.220
And this morning, as we understand the passage of Scripture

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.259
and understand what Jesus did

00:47:45.259 --> 00:47:49.979
and how He is superior to that Old Testament priesthood.

00:47:49.979 --> 00:47:53.139
Now, for really all of us,

00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:57.259
unless there are some watching that I'm not sure of your background,

00:47:57.259 --> 00:48:00.139
we've not been in any type of a situation

00:48:00.139 --> 00:48:03.940
where we've had the same type of experience

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.459
as these initial recipients to the book of Hebrews.

00:48:07.459 --> 00:48:10.419
But I want you to think about the impact upon these individuals.

00:48:10.419 --> 00:48:12.179
They see the temple.

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:14.779
They see everything that's taking place.

00:48:14.779 --> 00:48:17.259
They see the offerings. They see the priest there.

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:21.339
Remember, there were some wicked high priests during the time of Christ's day.

00:48:21.339 --> 00:48:24.940
In fact, they were ones that condemned Him to death.

00:48:24.979 --> 00:48:31.419
We find that here, as we come to these recipients

00:48:31.419 --> 00:48:33.940
that would initially have received this letter

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.299
that we call in our canon of Scripture the book of Hebrews,

00:48:37.299 --> 00:48:42.380
can you imagine how encouraging this truth would have been to them?

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.179
So you don't have a high priest over there.

00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:48.700
You have a great high priest that is far superior

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.219
to any of that Levitical priesthood.

00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:55.820
That Levitical priesthood was there for a purpose and it served its purpose.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.539
But now we have a greater priest.

00:48:57.539 --> 00:49:00.859
We have a great high priest.

00:49:00.859 --> 00:49:03.820
And I believe that these initial recipients,

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:07.140
those that initially received this letter, the book of Hebrews,

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.940
oh, how encouraged they must have been

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.779
as they came to the truth that we're studying this morning.

00:49:13.779 --> 00:49:16.099
Our great high priest.

00:49:16.099 --> 00:49:20.140
What a joy to know that he indeed is our great high priest,

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.099
that he's the fulfillment of the prophecy,

00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:27.539
that he follows the pattern as far as the truth that he was called of God.

00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:29.940
He is compassionate towards us.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.659
And he made the sacrifice that we could never make,

00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:37.779
the sacrifice for sin of his own body, his own blood.

00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:39.899
And what a joy to know that he is superior.

00:49:39.899 --> 00:49:42.140
Let's pray. Father, we love you.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.940
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:48.059
We thank you for our wonderful Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.299
He is our great high priest.

00:49:51.299 --> 00:49:54.859
We thank you that he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:58.700
We thank you that his sacrifice on the cross of Calvary

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.779
was accepted and sufficient,

00:50:00.779 --> 00:50:03.779
satisfying and fulfilling for us.

00:50:03.779 --> 00:50:09.779
the demands for man to be redeemed and reconciled to God.

00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:11.779
We thank You for Thy Word.

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:13.779
How we're encouraged this morning.

00:50:13.779 --> 00:50:15.779
Father, if there'd be one listening

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.779
who's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:50:17.779 --> 00:50:19.779
as their personal Savior,

00:50:19.779 --> 00:50:21.779
I pray that today,

00:50:21.779 --> 00:50:23.779
the Holy Spirit of God would work in their heart,

00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:25.779
draw them to Himself,

00:50:25.779 --> 00:50:29.779
help them understand that their sin

00:50:29.779 --> 00:50:31.779
brings with it a penalty.

00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:33.779
That penalty is death.

00:50:33.779 --> 00:50:35.779
Not speaking of physical, but spiritual death.

00:50:35.779 --> 00:50:37.779
Separation from God for all of eternity

00:50:37.779 --> 00:50:39.779
in the lake of fire.

00:50:39.779 --> 00:50:41.779
Oh, I pray that You would

00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:43.779
convict them of their sin,

00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:45.779
of Christ's righteousness,

00:50:45.779 --> 00:50:47.779
of judgment to come.

00:50:47.779 --> 00:50:49.779
We thank You

00:50:49.779 --> 00:50:51.779
that the Lord Jesus Christ is our great High Priest.

00:50:51.779 --> 00:50:53.779
I pray that we'd be encouraged

00:50:53.779 --> 00:50:55.779
by that truth this day.

00:50:55.779 --> 00:50:57.779
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do.

00:50:57.779 --> 00:50:59.779
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:50:59.779 --> 00:51:01.779
We have a moment of invitation here.

00:51:01.779 --> 00:51:03.779
For those that are watching at home,

00:51:03.779 --> 00:51:05.779
wherever you may be, we'd ask you to reflect

00:51:05.779 --> 00:51:07.779
upon what you've heard this morning.

00:51:07.779 --> 00:51:09.779
As we have a time of invitation here,

00:51:09.779 --> 00:51:11.779
would you also take some time there

00:51:11.779 --> 00:51:13.779
at your home or your place

00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:15.779
and reflect on what you've heard this morning

00:51:15.779 --> 00:51:17.779
from the Word of God.

00:51:17.779 --> 00:51:19.779
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano here.
