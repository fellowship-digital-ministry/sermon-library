WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
in vain in the Lord. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that wonderful promise? First

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Corinthians 15 57 and 58. I'm so thankful for that truth. Genesis chapter number 12 this evening.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.479
We'll be looking at verses 10 through 20. Genesis chapter number 12 verses 10 through 20. You'll

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:25.360
recall in our last study that we studied the first portion of Genesis chapter number 12. We looked at

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.600
verses 1 through 9 last Sunday evening and we had the opportunity to read how that Abram left Haran

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.639
and he had of course been there. He had traveled from the Ur of the Chaldees to Haran and his

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:46.000
father Terah died there in Haran and we understand that Abram then the Lord speaks to him and of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.080
course we find that the Bible tells us that he went into the land of Canaan, the place in which

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.319
God had directed him to. This evening as we look at verses 10 through 20 we notice in verse number

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.799
10 the Bible says there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.800
for the famine was grievous in the land. I've titled the message this evening Abram went down

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.279
into Egypt. Abram went down into Egypt. As we continue studying through the book of Genesis

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:21.519
we now find Abram and his family traveling to Egypt and we remember even as we've studied

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:28.160
really the latter part of chapter 11 into chapter number 12 that Abram had exercised faith and he

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.000
obeyed the instruction that God had given him and traveling from the Ur of the Chaldees to Haran and

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.360
then over down if you will down to Canaan and what a blessing to see the leadership of the Lord. I'm

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.080
so thankful for God's direction in our lives. I'm thankful for the word of God that gives us

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.720
direction and we find that as we would trace the steps of Abram that we would conclude this evening

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.199
that he was obedient to the instruction of the Lord in being in the place where he was and in

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:04.959
that leadership or in that obedience to God's leadership we would conclude that he was in the

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.199
place where he was supposed to be. Amen. And we would find that throughout the scriptures there

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.960
are many times in which you find the people of God have obeyed the direction of the Lord. They're

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.199
exactly where God has told them to be and yet they face difficulties. We are mindful of the

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.279
disciples as they were given the instruction to get on the boat and to cross the Sea of Galilee

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:38.240
and as soon as they get partly across the sea there's a great storm and the wind is boisterous

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.960
and all that's going on and we find that they were obedient. It was not a result of their

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.399
disobedience that they found themselves in a hardship in a place of difficulty. In fact it was

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:53.600
because of their obedience to the instruction that God had given that they found themselves

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.720
in that position. We said well that doesn't make sense. Well it does from God's perspective

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:04.160
because we find that from God's perspective that he's really interested in doing a couple of things

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.000
in our lives. Number one he wants to develop us. He wants to help us to grow in our walk with him

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.080
and of course we understand that in all things he is to be glorified and we find that throughout

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.919
the scriptures there are many times in which you would read of individuals that find themselves in

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.320
difficulty and God would be glorified through the situation. In fact in the nation of Israel

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.600
and their history as you would find that they leave Egypt and they are following the direction

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.240
of the Lord that they come to places of difficulty. It was not a result of their disobedience rather a

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.320
result of their obedience and God was developing them and God was being glorified through those

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.759
situations and we believe that to be the case here in Genesis chapter number 12 as well. As we look at

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.399
the passage notice with me first of all the difficulty in Canaan. Notice the Bible says

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.919
that there was a famine in the land. Now of course we understand this evening several things about

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.080
God and we understand that Abram will learn many things about God during his journey during his

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.079
life. We find that today as we have the complete canon of scripture that there are things that we

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.559
know about God because he's given us his word. Oh aren't you thankful for that. I'm thankful this

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:28.640
evening that we know that God is omniscient that he knows all things. How do we know that God is

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.679
omniscient because he's told us in his word. Amen. It's Abraham that would receive the truth from the

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:43.200
Lord when God says to Abraham I am the Lord. He tells him that he's El Shaddai the Lord God

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.040
Almighty and he reveals himself in that fashion to Abraham. Well because we have the complete canon

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.880
of scripture we know that he is omnipotent. We are aware of these truths and we understand that

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.160
he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last. And so we would understand as

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.200
we come to verse number 10 here in Genesis chapter number 12 that Abram did not know about the famine

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.480
but surely God knew about the famine. Amen. Now understand with me that Abram lives life just like

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.959
you and I live life. How do we live life? We live life one day at a time. One moment at a time.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:29.519
Correct? And we live life in that fashion and we understand that Abram would live life in that

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:35.040
fashion. In fact all of the characters that we find within the word of God they live life the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.720
same way that we do and we often have the understanding because we have the complete

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.320
canon of scriptures that we can look to and say well look at what's going to happen and look at

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.640
how this transpires and so on and so forth and we can miss the understanding that they were living

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.799
life one day at a time just like we are. Abram is in a place. Think about it. I mean put yourself in

00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:06.399
Abram's shoes. He's left the Ur of the Chaldees. He's traveled to Haran. He's left Haran and he's

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:13.839
now down in Canaan. He's in the place where God wants him to be and the Bible says and there was

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:21.119
a famine in the land. That could be kind of disappointing right? I mean seriously put yourself

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:26.959
in Abram's position. Understand where he is. We could ask ourselves this evening couldn't God have

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:32.160
delayed his his sending Abram? Couldn't God have done this? Yeah but God was going to do something

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.000
greater and through the events that we read here in Genesis chapter number 12 though Abram might

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.359
not pass the test as well as we would like Abram to pass the test we as believers that have the

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:53.040
complete canon of scripture we get to learn some amazing truth from this passage of scripture

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.480
and I'm so thankful that God chose to record it. You ever wonder why God has chosen to record

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.160
certain things and other things we don't have a whole lot of information about?

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:12.640
God's chosen to record exactly what he knows in his infinite wisdom that we need and so we look

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.799
here and we see that the Bible says and there was a famine in the land. No doubt as we would consider

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:25.600
the situation that Abram is now faced that we too have experienced similar circumstances. Maybe it's

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.799
not a famine but let's just call it a difficulty as we're looking at the difficulty in Canaan

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:36.559
and maybe we've obeyed the Lord in some fashion in our lives we've taken that step of obedience

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:42.160
we've taken that step of faith and we're trusting God and as soon as we take that step of faith

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:50.799
that step of obedience we're met with adversity. What does that do to you? It can cause us to be like

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.679
really? Why?

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:03.200
But we see that God's in control. God was the one that was leading Abraham.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.559
God was the one that was calling Abraham. If God is who he says he is and we believe

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:16.239
on the authority of the word of God that he is who he claims to be and he does not need anyone

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:24.480
to define him to us he has defined himself to us in his word then he is omniscient and he chose

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:32.719
to call Abram at the time that he did to leave the place that he left to come to the place that he did

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.159
knowing there was going to be a famine. Amen.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:48.239
But we find the difficulty sometimes we think that difficulties are the result solely the result of

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:57.359
disobedience. That's an error in our thinking. There are times in which we can view our own

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:02.559
difficulties or challenges or maybe we see the difficulties or challenges in the lives of others

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:07.039
and we conclude that there must be some level of disobedience that it must be

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:12.159
the chastening hand of the Lord. The reality is that it could be the chastening hand of the Lord

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:18.239
but we must acknowledge this evening that there are times in which obedience leads us directly

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:28.559
into the storm. Can I tell you to the to the lost person that makes no sense. To the unregenerate

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:36.159
man that makes no sense because in their mind they have this idea that if God is who you say

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:43.440
he is then he would never let those things happen. The problem is that they don't know who God is.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:49.200
They don't know the God of the Bible and for us this evening that have the complete canon of

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.799
scripture and we've studied and we've understood as much as we can understand how great our God is

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:59.840
and how much he loves us and what his plan is.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.200
we see that there are times in which he leads us directly into the storm. See, the

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.800
problem sometimes in our lives is that we don't have the same view as

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.640
God does. I think about it from a perspective of a construction project. I

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.560
will readily admit at the beginning of this illustration that you don't want me

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.800
running the construction project. But if I could use the illustration this

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.000
evening, I think maybe it would help us. If you're going to have a massive

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.320
construction project, if you come to church and you go down just a half a

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.480
mile from here, you know that Flint Hill School has been going through a very

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.520
massive construction project, right? If you drive on the roads in northern

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.680
Virginia, you understand that the roads are going through very massive

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.440
construction projects. In fact, I made note to Joseph the other day as we were

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.160
driving, we turned on a road where there had not been construction and now there

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.960
is construction. And I said, I think there's just construction everywhere,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.080
right? How many of you have been by the interchange of 28 and 66 up there in

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.520
Chantilly, in Centerville, Chantilly area? I mean, it's insane what they're doing up

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.120
there, right? Those that are watching livestream that live somewhere else, just

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.920
bear with us. It's crazy what they're doing. But here's the point. There's

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.160
somebody that is the the head of the project that sees the full picture of

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.120
what's going to happen. And then there's some worker over here that just knows

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.920
this is his job today. He might not understand why he's doing the

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.880
particular job that he's doing. He may not understand why it's so important

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.560
that he does it this way and follows this plan. But the reality is that if he

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.400
doesn't do his job properly, the whole of the project can fail. If I could use

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.600
that illustration this evening and share with us tonight that God has a view that

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.000
is far greater than our view. God has a plan that is far greater than our plan.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.920
And in God's plan and from God's view, he sees everything and he says, I'm gonna

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.880
allow this thing to happen. I'm gonna allow my children to experience this

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.920
difficulty so that I would be glorified, they would be developed, and so that I

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.120
can accomplish my greater plan. And sometimes we're too nearsighted to

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.800
understand how that thing works. And we don't understand the perspective of God

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.160
and what he's doing. And there are some that say, well, why would he allow this?

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.760
Why would he allow that? He has a purpose. He has a plan. And you know that as

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.080
Abraham faces this difficulty that he's exactly where he's supposed to be. It

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.920
continues and says in verse number 10, and Abram went down into Egypt to

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.720
sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land. We see the

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.160
difficulty in Canaan. I see the decision of Abram. In the latter part of

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.520
verse number 10 all the way down through verse number 16, we actually see many

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.720
decisions that Abram will make with regard to this difficulty that he faces.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.000
Can I tell you that in our lives today that we oftentimes make decisions as a

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.440
response to the difficulty. There are times in which we face the difficulty

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.400
and we can question whether we really were following the leadership of God.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.160
Right? We're human beings. It happens. We say, man, I did pray about this. I did

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.000
believe this was what I was supposed to do. But now I face this difficulty and

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.200
now I begin to second-guess and wonder, did I really do what I was supposed to

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.160
do? And so on and so forth. And sometimes we make decisions as a response to those

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.760
difficulties. Maybe I should say it this way, as a reaction to the difficulties.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.760
We're reacting to the circumstances in which we're dealing with and not really

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:12.280
sitting back and evaluating and responding in faith. The Bible tells us

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.560
that Abram does several things. There are several decisions that are made. We find

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.080
first of all in verse number 10 that they travel to Egypt. It says that Abram

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.920
went down into Egypt to sojourn there. Notice, I mean the famine was grievous in

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:33.240
the land. By the way, in several books later you will find as you read the

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.880
short book of Ruth that there was also a famine during that particular time and

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:44.320
they went into the country of Moab. You can read about that. And so we see here that

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.000
Abram is going to journey down into Egypt. Notice verse number 11, and it came

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.520
to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarai his

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:01.160
wife. This is the second decision that is made. He says, behold now I know that thou

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.000
art a fair woman to look upon. By the way, that's good fellas to tell your wife

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.440
that she's pretty. Amen? That's really what he's saying. If we can use today's

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:16.040
vernacular, he's saying, Sarai, you're looking good. Amen? That's what he's saying.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:26.720
Amen? He says, thou art a fair woman to look upon. Therefore, he's making this

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.280
decision on how she would identify herself. It says this, therefore it shall

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:42.000
come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say, this is his

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.560
wife, and they will kill me but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:58.000
art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.080
because of thee. So he gives instruction on how Sarai is to identify herself. The

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:11.480
Bible tells us back in chapter number 11 that Abram, that his wife was Sarai. You

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.720
see that in verse number 29, and Abram and Nahor took them wives. The name of

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.040
Abram's wife was Sarai. We see that as we go through the passage of Scripture, even

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.200
in verse number 5 of chapter number 12. This is, and Abram took Sarai his wife. We

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:32.000
find that in verse number 11 that he says that he said unto Sarai his wife.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.320
But he begins to reason. He begins to analyze the situation, if you will, and he

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.240
says, Sarai, you're a pretty woman, and we're gonna get there, and the Egyptians

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.760
are gonna conclude that you're my wife, and therefore they're gonna kill me, and

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.360
they're gonna save you alive, and so here's what I want you to do. I want you

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.120
to identify yourself as being my sister. There's deception that's going on here.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.120
We understand this is a half-truth. He'll deal with this in a second time in

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.080
Genesis chapter number 20. We'll mention that in just a moment, but you find here

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.060
that he says in verse number 13, say I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:20.540
be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee. I believe

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.940
that here, as we look at the decision that he makes with regard to giving

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.700
instruction to Sarai about how she would identify herself, that I conclude

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.900
simply that Abram is relying upon his own understanding. He's using his own

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.780
logic. How often have we been there? We analyze a situation. We may take that

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.060
piece of paper as we've been instructed by so many throughout the years, and you

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.700
list all the pros on this side. You list all the cons on this side, right? We've

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.900
gone through classes on decision-making and so on and so forth, but the reality

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.780
is that this man, Abram, at this point in his life, he is relying on his own

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:05.180
understanding. God gives us truth with regard to that. We're familiar with

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.500
Proverbs chapter number 3, verses 5 and 6, and it's such a powerful passage of

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.140
Scripture, and I believe this evening that as we consider Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.860
that God is giving us that instruction in that proverb about trusting in the

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.060
Lord because it's so easy for us as human beings to rely on our own

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:31.900
understanding. And here's what God says. We're familiar with the passage. Trust in

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:42.300
the Lord. How? With all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:55.580
Then it says this, in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:04.900
paths, thy paths. You think about that. I want God to direct my path. If we're

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.820
honest this evening with one another, I'll be transparent with you. I have

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.460
often the opportunity to be transparent publicly, and you get to smile at me, but

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:21.460
we sometimes, as human beings, I sometimes rely on my own understanding. I look at

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.660
the circumstances. I see the situation, and we kind of go into that default

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.180
setting, if you will, as human beings, and then we got to kind of, hopefully,

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.260
the Spirit of God will kind of convict us, and we come to that place where you

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.300
say, Lord, I want to trust you. Help me to trust you. Help me to have faith. Help me

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:47.940
to believe you. We find that as a result of these decisions, notice it says in

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:55.220
verse 14, and it came to pass that when Abram was coming to Egypt, the Egyptians

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:01.820
beheld the woman that she was very fair. Abram wasn't lying about

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.620
about Sarai. She was a beautiful woman.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.580
And they saw that, and it says in verse 15

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.540
that the princes also of Pharaoh saw her

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.820
and commended her before Pharaoh.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.420
And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.080
And he entreated Abram well for her sake.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.820
And he, Abram, had sheep and oxen

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.620
and asses and menservants and maidservants

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.900
and she-asses and camels.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.460
And we saw that back before

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.820
in verse 5, and Abram took Sarai, his wife,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.180
and Lot, his brother's son,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.500
and all their substance that they had gathered.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.780
And so we understand that they traveled down

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.660
to Egypt and a great host of them.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.340
In fact, as you read verse 1 of chapter 13,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.620
you see that the Bible says,

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.980
and Abram went up out of Egypt,

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.820
he and his wife, and all that he had,

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.700
and Lot with him into the south.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.380
And so you understand that they all

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.020
traveled down into Egypt.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.540
I want you to consider that Sarai

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.700
is now taken into Pharaoh's house.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.060
That's not a great situation, is it?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.580
Sometimes the decisions that we make

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.580
when we're relying on understanding

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.420
can lead to greater problem.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.740
And we see here that Sarai is now taken

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.140
into the home, the palace, if you will,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.660
of Pharaoh, and here it says that

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.340
the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.660
We see the decisions of Abram.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.780
We see the difficulty in Canaan.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.100
We see the decisions of Abram.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.420
I want you to notice with me

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.740
as we look at the next several verses

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.300
and close out chapter 12,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.700
the demonstration of God's power.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.380
The demonstration of God's power.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.660
I'm so thankful that our God is able.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.420
Able to do what?

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.180
Anything.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.420
I believe that this evening.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.940
I believe that God can do the impossible.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.220
I believe the truth of Ephesians 3

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.460
in verse 20,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.300
knowing to Him that is able to do

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.900
exceeding abundantly above

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.980
all that we ask or think.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.700
I believe that as the God of the universe

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.140
said to Jeremiah,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.700
call unto Me and I will answer thee

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.540
and show thee great and mighty things

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.980
which thou knowest not,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.540
God has declared His power

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.780
throughout His Word.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.500
It's one thing to declare your power.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.740
It's quite another thing to demonstrate your power.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.220
And I'm thankful this evening

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.380
that God has not only declared His power

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.580
in His Word,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.820
He says that He is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.020
He says there's nothing too difficult,

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.820
nothing too hard for Him.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.780
But we find that over and over

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.260
throughout the Word of God

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.020
that He demonstrates that power.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.700
There's something precious about that

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.060
demonstration of God's power.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.220
There's something impactful

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.260
about the demonstration of God's power.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.140
There's something about reading

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.500
through the Scriptures

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.620
and seeing the power of God on display

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.700
that will strengthen your faith.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.660
That will encourage you to believe

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.340
that God is able.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.420
This evening, we find that even though

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.340
Abram had made some decisions

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.980
and he goes down into Egypt

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.660
and he's there and he tells Sarai,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.820
here's how I want you to identify yourself,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.580
and Sarai is now in the house of Pharaoh,

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.540
that God still works mightily.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.100
The Bible tells us in v. 17,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.060
and the Lord plagued Pharaoh

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.020
and his house with great plagues

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.700
because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.220
You know, it's interesting, oftentimes

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.300
when we think about the plagues in Egypt,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.620
what do we think about?

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.980
Moses!

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.500
We think about the events in the book of Exodus, right?

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.740
That's immediately where our minds go to

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.340
when we think about the plagues in Egypt.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.540
And certainly, we find that they're rehearsed

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.020
and you can see how God is demonstrating

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.660
His power there to the Pharaoh

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.300
in the book of Exodus,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.420
and you can read of those

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.100
and you can find how the psalmist

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.860
refers back to the plagues in Egypt,

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.460
but I want you to understand

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.420
that well before Moses ever came upon the scene,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.380
well before the children of Israel

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.420
were in Egypt in bondage,

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.700
that God plagued Pharaoh.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.260
The Bible says that the Lord plagued Pharaoh

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.460
and his house with great plagues.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.339
I don't know what they were.

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:46.100
We know the plagues in Egypt

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.059
during the life and ministry of Moses.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:49.380
We can read them and study them

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.980
and we can see what they are.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.619
We can see how those plagues

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:55.100
on certain occasions,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.580
they affected the entire land

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.460
and other times there was a division

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.300
and the plague would be upon the Egyptians,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.220
but not upon the people of God.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.540
And you saw God demonstrating His power,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.220
but here in Genesis 12,

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.980
when Abram goes to Egypt,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.660
when Abram says to Sarai,

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.260
say that you're my sister,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.500
and Sarai is now in the home of the Pharaoh,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.260
that the Lord God of the universe

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.100
plagues Pharaoh with great plagues.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.940
God's demonstrating His power.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.619
I hope this evening that this encourages you.

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:34.339
I hope this evening that as we begin to see

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:36.140
what's happening and we begin to see

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.420
how God is intervening

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.300
and how God is doing what Abram could not do.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.820
You understand in this particular situation,

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:51.700
you understand that Abram is in a real bind.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.899
Have you ever made some decision

00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:59.220
and say, man, I really messed this thing up?

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.140
The Bible says,

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.059
notice verse 18,

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:07.140
and Pharaoh called Abram and said,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.820
I just wish I could kind of have a glimpse

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.260
of what this was like.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.940
Because I kind of, if I can,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.980
in my sanctified imagination,

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.500
have this picture of Abram being wherever he was

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.220
and Pharaoh being in his house

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.660
and Sarai is there,

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.860
and he's plagued by the Lord.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.899
We don't know what those plagues are,

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:31.420
but I see a level of urgency

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.339
on the part of Pharaoh calling for Abram.

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:35.660
Amen?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.460
He says, and Pharaoh called Abram and said,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.059
what is this that thou hast done unto me?

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:45.020
Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.500
God somehow had supernaturally revealed,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.460
perhaps it's Sarai that reveals to Pharaoh

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.020
in the midst of all these plagues

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.740
that she is the wife of Abram.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.940
And this man, this Pharaoh,

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.580
he has some level of urgency

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.700
for calling Abram.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.980
I mean, listen, God got this guy's attention.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.220
Right?

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.100
No doubt, if this was the practice,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.740
if this was what happened,

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.779
no doubt there were plenty of other women

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:24.220
that had been taken into the house of Pharaoh.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.899
If Abram assumed that this was going to happen

00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:28.460
and it's exactly what happened

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.460
when they arrived there,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.580
I'm sure that Sarai wasn't the first one.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.500
But I believe that Pharaoh had an experience

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.420
that he never had before.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.460
Why? Because the Lord God of the universe

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.820
plagued him with great plagues.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.820
His house.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.820
Not just him.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.660
Those that were there.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:55.940
Notice, he says, what is this that thou hast done unto me?

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.380
Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.740
Why saidst thou, she is my sister,

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.260
so I might have taken her to meet a wife.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.740
Now therefore, behold thy wife,

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.500
take her and go thy way.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.980
You notice something very interesting.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.899
He didn't command for Abram to be killed.

00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:22.300
Is that not what Abram assumed was going to happen?

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.020
Did not Abram have the conclusion

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.260
that Sarai, you're a beautiful woman,

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.980
when we get there, they're going to see you,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.380
they're going to say that you're my wife,

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.500
and they're going to kill me for your sake

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.539
and they're going to take you.

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:38.059
So do this. Identify in this manner.

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:39.380
Right?

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.500
Now when Pharaoh knows that Sarai

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.260
is the wife of Abram,

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.140
he beckons, he calls for Abram, I believe,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.780
with a level of urgency.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.539
I remember the way in which the Pharaoh

00:28:52.539 --> 00:28:55.940
called for Joseph at the end of this book of Genesis

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.979
and you understand how he was called with haste.

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:04.179
And we find here

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:08.700
that Abram is told,

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.739
behold thy wife,

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:13.820
take her and go thy way.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.940
Isn't that awesome?

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.940
Abram's not killed.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.059
Sarai's not killed.

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:24.700
God supernaturally prevented

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.619
Pharaoh from doing anything to Sarai.

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:30.979
Which, by the way, could have.

00:29:30.979 --> 00:29:32.460
Remember, we talked about the way

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.020
in which the latter part of Genesis 11,

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.140
the focus, the lens of Scripture

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.179
zeroes in upon Abram and his line.

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:43.979
Why? Because of the messianic prophecies.

00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:46.380
What was the promised seed that was going to come?

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.260
Remember, we understand the fullness of that

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.179
is the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:53.419
but we understand that Abram and Sarai

00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:56.619
would have a son, Isaac.

00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:59.419
God was working.

00:29:59.419 --> 00:30:01.859
God is always able to work.

00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:04.939
We find the Bible says in v. 20,

00:30:04.939 --> 00:30:08.059
not only did Pharaoh say to Abram,

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:10.439
here's your wife, take her and go thy way.

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:13.199
Then Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him

00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:14.959
and they sent him away and his wife

00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:17.799
and all that he had.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:23.239
It was as if he had some level of protection

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.419
from the Pharaoh,

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:26.499
but the reality is that he had protection

00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:29.179
from God Almighty.

00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:30.679
And this evening,

00:30:30.679 --> 00:30:32.759
as I look at this passage of Scripture,

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:34.919
as I see the difficulty that Abram

00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:36.879
encountered there in Canaan,

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:39.559
as I rehearse the decisions that were made

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:41.079
and how they journeyed

00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:42.639
and what they decided to do,

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:46.359
and I see the place in which Sarai ends up,

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:49.279
but then I view the demonstration of God's power

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:50.799
and I see how God works.

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:53.399
It encourages me this evening.

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:54.639
But here's the lesson.

00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:57.679
I'd ask this question.

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:59.039
As you look at Scripture

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:00.919
and you begin to understand

00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:03.679
that God has given us His Word for a purpose,

00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:07.839
it's more than just a historical account.

00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:10.159
I'm thankful for the fact that the Word of God,

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.719
especially in the Old Testament,

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:13.799
when you read about the historical events

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:14.679
that are recorded,

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:18.919
that God has given us an accurate account of history.

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:22.359
But it's so much more than that.

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:25.719
We find that there are lessons.

00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:27.479
We could ask ourselves this question

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.439
as we go through life.

00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:31.199
Maybe as a parent,

00:31:31.199 --> 00:31:33.839
you've said to your children at some point or another

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:34.999
as they've gone through life

00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:36.719
and they've experienced some difficulty,

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.199
they went through some hardship,

00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:43.359
you say, hey, did you learn your lesson?

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:45.519
And I've asked myself this question about Abram

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.759
in this passage of Scripture.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:49.959
Abram, did you learn your lesson?

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:52.039
Did you learn a lesson, Abram,

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:54.639
that you can trust God,

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:57.199
that God is able to work

00:31:57.199 --> 00:32:00.479
beyond what you can even fathom?

00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:01.799
Unfortunately, I'd have to say

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:04.279
that Abram didn't learn the lesson.

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:06.279
Why? Because in Genesis 20,

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:08.559
he does the same thing.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.879
How many of you have made the same mistake more than once?

00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:12.439
Don't raise your hand, right?

00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:16.159
Sometimes we call ourselves slow learners.

00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:17.999
I like to be a fast learner.

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:19.679
It doesn't mean I'm always a fast learner,

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:22.039
but I like to be a fast learner.

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:25.119
In fact, I try to, as much as possible,

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:26.799
not only learn from my mistakes,

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:29.639
but learn from other people's mistakes.

00:32:29.639 --> 00:32:31.799
It saves a lot of time.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:35.639
Amen? You know what I mean?

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:39.039
We don't always learn the first time though.

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:41.639
Abram didn't learn.

00:32:41.639 --> 00:32:45.479
In Genesis 20, we'll get there in a few months probably,

00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:47.959
but in Genesis 20,

00:32:47.959 --> 00:32:51.919
you read about the situation with Abimelech.

00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:56.879
You find that he goes down there and he says,

00:32:56.879 --> 00:32:58.559
in verse 2 of Genesis 20,

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:02.079
Abraham said of Sarah, his wife,

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:05.439
she is my sister.

00:33:05.439 --> 00:33:07.479
He didn't learn his lesson.

00:33:07.479 --> 00:33:08.519
Similar things happen.

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.199
We'll get to it in several months, weeks,

00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:12.279
whatever it's going to be.

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:14.399
But the reality this evening

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:17.039
is when we can ask if Abram learned a lesson,

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.359
and we can say, well, not really,

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:19.879
because he repeated the same mistake

00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:21.719
in Genesis 20.

00:33:21.719 --> 00:33:23.279
My question for me this evening,

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.399
my question for you this evening,

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:27.799
is have we learned a lesson?

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:29.839
You say, well, what's the lesson we're supposed to learn?

00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:31.839
Don't lie about my wife's identity?

00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:33.439
No, no.

00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:35.959
That's not the lesson to learn.

00:33:35.959 --> 00:33:37.639
Amen? It's not.

00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:39.999
Here's the lesson to learn.

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:42.839
We've got to stop intervening

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:46.479
and acting like the solution to our problem

00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:50.559
relies on us.

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:52.679
That's how we live sometimes.

00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:54.759
Amen? That's how we live sometimes.

00:33:54.759 --> 00:33:56.799
We live as if we see a situation

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:58.959
and say, okay, here's how we have to solve

00:33:58.959 --> 00:34:00.599
that situation and here's what's going to be

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:02.359
dependent upon, and I'm going to do this,

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:03.279
that, and the other thing,

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:04.959
and I'm going to manipulate whatever I'm going to do

00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:08.079
in order to resolve this issue.

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.359
What about if we just step back

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:12.999
and let God be God?

00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:15.159
What is it that we could see God do

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.919
if we really would just trust Him?

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:19.279
Now, I'm thankful this evening

00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:21.319
that Abraham had the opportunity

00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:23.079
to see God work in a mighty way

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:25.959
and God plagued the house of Pharaoh

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:27.759
because of this situation,

00:34:27.759 --> 00:34:30.639
and I believe we learned lessons because of that.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.119
Here's the lesson that we learned.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:34.319
As much as I try, I can fail,

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:37.759
but God still can.

00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:39.559
Can I ask you this evening,

00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:42.559
if Abraham would have showed up in Egypt

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:43.959
and he would have walked in there

00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:46.199
and said, this is my wife,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.799
do you think that God was able

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:50.719
to protect her and him?

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:52.599
Yeah.

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:55.399
How is it that God would have protected them?

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:59.319
We don't know because He didn't do it that way.

00:34:59.319 --> 00:34:59.959
Right?

00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:02.639
So we have no idea what God would have done.

00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:05.039
But we know that God still worked.

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:07.519
And this evening, I believe that there are times

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.039
in my life, I believe that if you'd be honest

00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:12.279
this evening, there are times in your life

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:17.239
that you miss out on seeing what God can do

00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:22.519
because we've done.

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:26.359
And this evening, we look at this passage of Scripture

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:32.759
and we say, man, our God is able.

00:35:32.759 --> 00:35:34.799
Our God can.

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:40.839
And our God does work in miraculous ways.

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:44.039
And He is able to do what I can't even comprehend.

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:46.000
See, Abraham in this situation,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.759
Abraham in this situation,

00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:50.159
he could not come up with a way

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:52.519
in which God could work.

00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:55.159
It was beyond perhaps his logic, his reasoning,

00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:59.199
so he has to take matters into his own hands.

00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:01.439
But really, he doesn't have to.

00:36:01.439 --> 00:36:02.959
But you understand this evening,

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.559
there are times that we're in the same boat.

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:06.079
Right?

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:08.839
There are times we're in the same exact boat.

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:10.839
We say, I don't know what's going to happen.

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:12.039
I don't know how this is going to work out.

00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:14.039
I don't know what's going to...

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.679
Just trust God.

00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:17.119
You say, that's too easy.

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:21.559
I know waiting and trusting is not the easiest thing to do.

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:24.199
It's a hard thing.

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:25.759
When I said that you say it's too easy,

00:36:25.759 --> 00:36:27.399
people have that response.

00:36:27.399 --> 00:36:29.799
Oh, that's just an easy answer.

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:32.599
No, no, it's the right answer.

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:38.959
Not easy to do, but it's the right answer.

00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:45.039
The psalmist said it is time for thee to work, O Lord.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:46.879
The reality this evening is that

00:36:46.879 --> 00:36:49.399
when we look at the whole of Scripture,

00:36:49.399 --> 00:36:54.879
when we look at events that God has recorded in His Word,

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:57.919
they're given to us to strengthen our faith.

00:36:57.919 --> 00:37:03.719
They're given to us to help us to learn lessons.

00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:06.559
As I mentioned a moment ago,

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:09.839
Abram may not have learned the lesson,

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:13.479
but I believe this evening that we can learn the lesson.

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:16.719
I believe that we can look at the event in Genesis 12.

00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:19.159
We can look at the event in Genesis 20,

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:21.679
and we can learn some valuable life lessons

00:37:21.679 --> 00:37:23.639
on how we live our lives,

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:28.759
and how we live by faith and trust the Lord.

00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:30.679
Because God is able.

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:32.639
He's able.

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:36.759
And I'm so thankful that God worked here

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:41.599
in this passage of Scripture to remind us,

00:37:41.639 --> 00:37:43.919
to show us, to demonstrate to us,

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:46.919
to display to us what He's able to do.

00:37:46.919 --> 00:37:51.479
I don't know what each individual situation is.

00:37:51.479 --> 00:37:52.679
I know one thing.

00:37:52.679 --> 00:37:56.119
We've got a whole lot of problems in our world.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.399
Amen?

00:37:57.399 --> 00:38:00.719
We've got a lot of problems in our world.

00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:02.039
Sometimes you talk to people

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:03.639
and there's a long conversation that goes on

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:04.879
and somebody may come and say,

00:38:04.879 --> 00:38:07.039
hey, did you solve all the problems of the world?

00:38:07.039 --> 00:38:10.119
We are not solving all the problems of the world.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:13.679
Can I tell you that God is the answer?

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:16.479
Jesus is the answer?

00:38:16.479 --> 00:38:18.719
We begin to sit back and say,

00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:20.879
what is God able to do?

00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:23.919
How is God able to work?

00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:27.039
Not what kind of program I can put together,

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:29.639
what kind of thing I can do,

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:32.959
but we want God to work.

00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:35.479
And this evening,

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.880
I hope that we'd learn a lesson

00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:40.919
from this event in the life of Abram.

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:43.159
They went down into Egypt.

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:45.839
Listen, there are times that you're going to face difficulties in your life.

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:48.719
In fact, I mentioned on Wednesday evening

00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:50.440
that passage of Scripture in Acts 4

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.880
that they had been with Jesus.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.359
It won't prevent the hardships,

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:59.599
but it certainly will prepare you for them.

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:04.119
We think about Daniel in Daniel 6.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:06.039
Daniel had a hardship.

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:09.799
It was called a den of lions.

00:39:09.799 --> 00:39:11.519
But do you know that it was actually

00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:14.640
his very walk with God

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.320
that resulted in that hardship?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.640
Because he prayed, right?

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.679
The Bible tells us.

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:25.440
This evening,

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.440
there are going to be some difficulties.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.559
But how we respond to those difficulties,

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:33.279
what are the decisions that we make in response to that,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.359
we must not lean on our own understanding.

00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:40.679
We must recognize that God is able.

00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:42.479
And that God can do something

00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:46.519
that we cannot even begin to fathom.

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:48.839
And I want to see God work.

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:52.320
I want to see God do something miraculous.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.919
He's able.

00:39:53.919 --> 00:39:56.239
He really is.

00:39:56.239 --> 00:40:01.239
God loves to show Himself powerful.

00:40:01.239 --> 00:40:04.679
I love the truth of God's Word when you look and say,

00:40:04.679 --> 00:40:08.559
we can't explain it other than to say God did it.

00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:10.519
The Lord did it.

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:11.479
Right?

00:40:11.479 --> 00:40:14.199
You think about those disciples with the feeding of the 5,000,

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:16.439
the feeding of the 4,000.

00:40:16.439 --> 00:40:18.759
Someone could come to them, and it's not recorded in the Scripture,

00:40:18.759 --> 00:40:19.959
but someone says, how did you do this?

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.719
We didn't.

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.399
God did.

00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:25.759
What was the perspective of the disciples, by the way,

00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:27.239
in both of those accounts?

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:31.439
Send them away that they might get something to eat.

00:40:31.439 --> 00:40:33.559
Right?

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:40.239
But this evening, oh, that we would have that increased faith that God can.

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.519
God is still God.

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:46.039
He's still upon His throne, and He's still able.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:46.479
Let's pray.

00:40:46.479 --> 00:40:48.399
Father, we love You.

00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:51.879
We thank You for loving us.

00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:56.159
As we consider the event and the life of Abram this evening,

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:59.799
we see the historical account of their journey to Egypt,

00:40:59.799 --> 00:41:04.319
and we read of the famine.

00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:11.039
God, we understand this evening that You are God,

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:18.519
that even as Abram obeyed You and thus was in the very place

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:23.959
that he was supposed to be, there was a great famine.

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:28.759
Lord, we learn lessons from that.

00:41:28.759 --> 00:41:37.439
The time of difficulty and hardship is not necessarily the result of disobedience,

00:41:37.439 --> 00:41:43.879
but rather an opportunity for You to be glorified and for us to be developed.

00:41:43.879 --> 00:41:48.479
Father, we think of the demonstration of Your power here in this passage of Scripture,

00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:51.719
how it encourages my heart

00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:58.759
to once again be reminded of what You are able to do and how You are able to work.

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:05.199
God, it is our prayer this evening that we'd learn a valuable lesson,

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:07.639
that we would not rely on our own understanding,

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:15.359
that we would not try to scheme and devise some type of plan in our own understanding.

00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:20.679
God, that we'd exercise faith, believe You and trust You,

00:42:20.679 --> 00:42:26.119
that You're able to protect.

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:30.599
I believe this evening with all my heart

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:37.839
that if Abram would have entered Egypt, declared that Sir I was his wife,

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:42.479
that You would have divinely protected them.

00:42:42.479 --> 00:42:47.479
God, I pray this evening that You would help us

00:42:47.479 --> 00:42:53.199
in our lives daily as we walk moment by moment, day by day.

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:56.799
You'd help us to recognize that You are able.

00:42:56.799 --> 00:42:59.559
Help us to live by faith.

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:03.479
I pray that You would work in hearts and lives this evening,

00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:06.679
help us to make decisions that would please Thee.

00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:10.319
Help us to respond in obedience.

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:14.239
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:15.239
Would You stand with me?

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:16.399
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:18.799
Holly's at the piano.

00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:22.639
Maybe this evening you need to make your pew at an altar.

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:25.719
Maybe you need to come to this old-fashioned altar.

00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:29.399
Maybe you're facing a difficulty, a challenge.

00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:31.319
Maybe you've relied upon your own understanding

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:33.039
and you want to come to that place and say,

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:34.039
Lord, I surrender.

00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:35.879
Lord, I want to see You work.

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:41.559
I want to see You do beyond what I could even fathom.

00:43:41.559 --> 00:43:43.399
As Holly plays, the altar is open.
