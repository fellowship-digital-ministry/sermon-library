1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
16. As I mentioned this morning, I'm so thankful for the Word of God and thankful that we're able

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,760
to have a copy of the Word of God and that we're speaking with someone this week and sharing with

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,040
them some of the ministries that we've done here at the church over the years and discussing the

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,239
Bible assembly campaign and the opportunity to assemble scriptures. And we've not been able to

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:32,080
do that in 2020, but look forward to being able to get engaged with that ministry once again.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,400
And what a blessing to be able to see the Word of God go around the world. In your Bible this

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,119
evening, Genesis chapter number 16, we'll be looking at the entire chapter, Genesis 16,

8
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,759
looking at verses 1 through 16. And let me read the first verse. We'll dig into the scriptures

9
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:52,880
this evening. The Bible says, Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. And she had a handmaid,

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,639
an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. If you look over in verse number 15 of our text,

11
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:04,879
the Bible says, And Hagar bare Abram a son. And Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare,

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,080
Ishmael. And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message, The Birth of Ishmael,

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,160
The Birth of Ishmael. The content of Genesis 16 reveals to us the humanity of Abram and Sarai.

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,440
As we think about the passage that we studied over the last few weeks in Genesis chapter number 15,

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:37,680
and just the powerful truth that God gave us, and the way in which God came and spoke to Abram,

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,360
and the conversation that they had, the dialogue, if you will, back and forth. And Abram receives

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,639
the promise of the Lord, and the promise with regard to the seed, the promise with regard to

19
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:54,720
the land, as we looked at last week. And we look at that Abrahamic covenant, as we often refer to

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,519
it as, and what great truth is provided to us in Genesis chapter number 15. And we enter into

21
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:08,800
chapter number 16, and I believe that as we look at this passage, it is very possible that we can

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,559
examine this chapter with a critical eye. It is possible for us to, in fact, any portion of

23
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:22,160
Scripture, but especially this passage of Scripture with regard to the study that we've been doing

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,559
through the book of Genesis, it is possible that we enter into with that critical eye, and we critique

25
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:34,320
the behavior, the decisions of those. And at the onset of the message this evening,

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,080
there are bad decisions that are made in Genesis chapter number 16, but as we look at the passage,

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,320
I think that it's possible that if we examine the Scriptures with a critical eye, and we just

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,520
examine Genesis chapter number 16 with accusing and critiquing the decisions of Abram and Sarai,

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,520
that it is very possible that in doing so, we may miss the lessons that God has for us to learn

30
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:07,279
from studying the event that is before us. I think most of us would agree this evening

31
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:14,320
that I'm glad that my life story hasn't been written down and recorded for generations of

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,679
people to read. The reality is that there are certain aspects of our lives, no doubt,

33
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:28,320
that have been recorded. There are times in which while I'm preaching, maybe I say something

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,679
in a twisted way. I put the words in the wrong order or something, and then that's recorded,

35
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:38,479
and somebody can go back and look at it. But I think about Abram and Sarai, and I think about

36
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,679
the way in which their life and many of the events of their life are recorded in the pages of

37
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:50,399
Scripture. And they've been viewed, and they've been studied for generations of people. Not only

38
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:55,919
Abram and Sarai, many other of the characters in the Word of God. And we know that the only perfect

39
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,520
person is God. The Lord Jesus Christ came and lived a perfect and sinless life. And as we look

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:09,119
at Genesis chapter number 16, I believe that the record reveals to us the humanity of these

41
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:14,639
individuals. The fact that they deal with some of the same difficulties that we deal with.

42
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,920
Listen, we're not always as patient as we ought to be. Amen? We don't always have the faith that

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,600
we ought to have. We don't always live in obedience to the commands that God has given us.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,239
And if we're not careful, we can, with a critical eye, look at a passage of Scripture such as this

45
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,239
one and say, they should have done this, and they should have done that. And I understand, we'll

46
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:41,359
share some of those things this evening. But all my prayer tonight as we look at this passage is

47
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:48,079
that we would learn from that which is recorded, and we would be able to make good decisions in

48
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,839
our own lives. As we're going to dig into the passage and look at the entirety of the chapter,

49
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,679
I do think that it's important to really dissect verse number one just for a moment as it helps to

50
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:06,000
set the scene as to that which would unfold in Genesis chapter number 16. Notice with me,

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,040
the Bible begins and tells us, Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. Now this is a recurring

52
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,079
statement or theme throughout the Scriptures with regard to our first introduction to Abram and

53
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,000
Sarai. In fact, if you go back to Genesis chapter number 11, and you find that as God would provide

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,720
us with the history of Abraham and the generations of Terah as they begin in verse number 27,

55
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:44,320
the Bible tells us in Genesis 11 and verse number 30, But Sarai was barren, she had no child.

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,600
The Bible tells us, even as we studied the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis over the last few

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,959
weeks, that Abram said in verse number 3 of Genesis 15, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

58
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,480
And of course, God's response when Abram says that one born in mine house is mine heir,

59
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:13,119
God said to him, This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels

60
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:21,359
shall be thine heir. We come to chapter number 16 and we once again are reminded of this situation

61
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:29,519
in which the Bible tells us that Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. Now the Bible continues

62
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:36,880
to go on and it introduces us to someone that is her handmaid. It says, And she, Sarai, had

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:46,559
a handmaid. Notice this, an Egyptian whose name was Hagar. I'm not sure how often you have really

64
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:53,839
considered the content of Genesis 16 or how much time you've spent at really trying to figure out

65
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,000
where did this Hagar come from. We know the Bible says that she's an Egyptian, but I would encourage

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,040
you just for a moment to turn back to Genesis chapter number 12. You'll recall with me in Genesis

67
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,600
chapter number 12, as God had called Abram to leave the Ur of the Chaldees, as it is mentioned

68
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,239
at the end of chapter 11, the beginning of chapter number 12, that as they get into the land, as they

69
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:21,279
get to that place where God had promised them to go, it tells us in verse number five, And Abram

70
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,320
took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered,

71
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,200
and the souls that they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan,

72
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:39,440
and into the land of Canaan, they came. And we find that in verse number 10, the Bible says that

73
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,359
there was a famine in the land. If you remember, as we studied this portion of Scripture, that we

74
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:53,600
spoke about the plan of God and how God and his wisdom and knowledge that he led Abram and his

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,399
family to go to this place at this time, and yet as they arrive, they encounter this famine. And

76
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:08,959
the Bible tells us that Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous

77
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,279
in the land. Of course, we understand that while Abram and Sarai and Lot and those servants that

78
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,920
he had went down into Egypt, that the Bible tells us that Abram's greatest concern was for his wife

79
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,640
Sarai, and he said, Tell them that you're my sister, because they're going to see you, and

80
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,239
they're going to see that you're beautiful, and they're going to kill me for your sake.

81
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,440
We find that God miraculously took care of Sarai and Abram, and God dealt with Pharaoh. We studied

82
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,000
this a number of weeks ago, and we find that the Bible tells us that Abram and his wife and his

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,359
family, they leave in verse number one of chapter 13, it says, and Abram went up out of Egypt,

84
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:55,119
he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him into the south. I do not believe that I can

85
00:08:55,119 --> 00:09:03,520
prove it biblically that Hagar became a handmaid during this particular trip, but it certainly

86
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,440
seems to be the case. And we find that it's important for us to understand that even the

87
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,479
decisions that we make, and in this particular context as we look at a timeline, that it will

88
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:22,320
perhaps have consequences later on down the road. And we find that even here in Genesis chapter

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,599
number 16, that will be a recurring thought throughout the message this evening. But we find

90
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:34,960
that the Bible introduces us not only or reminds us of the situation of Sarai being barren, having

91
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:42,159
no children, but also the Scriptures introduce us to this one named Hagar, who was an Egyptian.

92
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,919
Now, as we dig into the passage, I want you to notice first of all, if you're taking points,

93
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:54,080
the reasoning of Sarai. In verse number two, God gives us a glimpse into the reasoning of Sarai.

94
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,840
The Bible says in verse number two, and Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now the Lord hath

95
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,160
that restrained me from bearing.

96
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,240
I pray Thee, go in unto my maid.

97
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,040
It may be that I may obtain children by her."

98
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
As we begin to think,

99
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,720
and we'll read verse 2 in just a moment,

100
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,280
as we begin to think about the reasoning of Sarai

101
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,000
and we see her perspective in verse 2

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,320
in this beginning section of this verse of Scripture,

103
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,400
that she goes to her husband

104
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
and she says she identifies

105
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,400
what has already been well known.

106
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,920
We know that she's barren.

107
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,520
We know that Abram had already spoken to God

108
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,080
in chapter number 15 about having no seed.

109
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,240
And we find that she says to her husband,

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,400
the Lord hath restrained me from bearing.

111
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,880
Now look at the logic, the reasoning, if you will.

112
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,640
She says, I pray Thee, go in unto my maid.

113
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

114
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,000
As we would think about the thought,

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,840
the reasoning, and the perspective,

116
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,080
I would say that it was one of sight and not of faith.

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,600
I would say that when we look at what's taking place here,

118
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,600
that what is being said was something that was legitimate

119
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,080
with regard to the society in which they lived.

120
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,760
It was certainly something that had taken place

121
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,720
and something that they were aware of

122
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,680
that she, as being barren,

123
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,480
could have children through her handmaid.

124
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
And we find that she's going to,

125
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,480
with this reasoning and this logic,

126
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,480
she's going to bring this idea to Abram.

127
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,000
And I want you to just stop and think for a moment.

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,040
I want you to consider with me

129
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,520
that as we think about the situation

130
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,480
and we think about all that Abram and Sarai have dealt with,

131
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,920
I want you to consider with me

132
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,360
that it's been 10 years since they left the Ur of the Chaldees.

133
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
I want you to consider with me

134
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
that when they received that call,

135
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,400
when Abram received that call in chapter 12,

136
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,160
that he had received the fact

137
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,800
that God would make of thee a great nation,

138
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,440
I will bless thee and make thy name great.

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,280
He goes through and he gives them these promises,

140
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,000
and of course, they're repeated throughout the Scriptures.

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,800
At that particular time, Abram is 75 years old.

142
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,520
By the end of chapter 16,

143
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,200
we'll find that Abram is 86 years old.

144
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,640
And so there's a period of just about 10 years that goes by.

145
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,240
And after 10 years of waiting,

146
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,760
and after 10 years of not having any children,

147
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,240
we find that it's come to the place

148
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,240
where it's adversely affected the reasoning of Sarai.

149
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,160
She begins to have a sight answer to the problem

150
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
instead of a faith solution to the problem.

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,680
I think that when we would evaluate our circumstances

152
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,480
and our situations that we face,

153
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,520
I would wonder this evening

154
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,240
as we have decisions that we have to make,

155
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,760
what is it that we go through as a process?

156
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
What is it that we begin to evaluate?

157
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,320
Where does the promise of God

158
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,120
lay within our decision-making process?

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
See, the reality this evening

160
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
is there are times in which many of us

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
have not waited 10 years for God to do something.

162
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
10 years is a long time.

163
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,080
10 years is a very long time.

164
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,200
They're older, they've heard this promise,

165
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
but she's barren.

166
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,680
She's had no children.

167
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,360
They look at society and they see

168
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,760
that this is a practice that is accepted.

169
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
And so she begins to, in her mind,

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
as we think about her reasoning,

171
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,600
she comes to this conclusion.

172
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,040
Again, I believe it's the wrong conclusion,

173
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
but I wonder this evening,

174
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,120
can we relate a little bit with Sarai?

175
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,160
Can we, instead of criticizing her,

176
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
try to learn from her?

177
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm not in any way suggesting

178
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
that she made a good decision.

179
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,840
She didn't, it was a terrible decision.

180
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,800
But there are times in which we make terrible decisions

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,920
and we've not waited 10 minutes for God.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,320
10 years is a long time.

183
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,320
The Bible tells us that she says,

184
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
I pray thee, go in unto my maid.

185
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,280
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

186
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,080
I wonder how many different ways

187
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,840
we could apply the thought this evening

188
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
from this passage of Scripture

189
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,320
and how there are times in which

190
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,880
we try to take matters in our own hands.

191
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,480
That we try to manipulate circumstances

192
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,640
or to build something.

193
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,240
We're not waiting on God.

194
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
We know that God's promised to work.

195
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,480
We know that He's given us promises

196
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,040
that I'm gonna build the church

197
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
and He's given us a pattern,

198
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
a plan, if you will, on how to reach the world

199
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

200
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,200
But I wonder, have we stuck to the plan?

201
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Are we doing what God said?

202
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,760
Or do we just kinda, you know what?

203
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,280
That's not working and we're tired of waiting.

204
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,240
And see here, Sarai, it's a terrible decision.

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,400
Again, I wanna repeat that.

206
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
I wanna make sure that we understand this evening

207
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
that I'm not saying that this is a right decision.

208
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm simply suggesting this evening

209
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,600
that I can understand how someone

210
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,320
could make a wrong decision

211
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,680
when our reasoning is getting messed up.

212
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,200
When we're looking at it by sight

213
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,160
and not by faith.

214
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,280
When we say, I look at my own resources,

215
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,040
and again, they're stricken in years,

216
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,360
when we say, this is not happening.

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm barren and maybe you can have a child in this manner.

218
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,680
Maybe it is that I would obtain children by her.

219
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,480
See, this evening, instead of criticizing Sarai,

220
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
I wonder if we would evaluate our own lives

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,280
and decisions and ask ourselves,

222
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,720
how much patience and faith do we have?

223
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
How much patience and faith do we have

224
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,720
on waiting on the promises of God?

225
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,960
In allowing God to work

226
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,160
in a way that only He will work?

227
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
In a way that would only bring honor and glory to His name?

228
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,400
We see the reasoning of Sarai, number two.

229
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,520
If you're taking notes at the end of verse number two

230
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,280
and down through verse number four,

231
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,760
I want you to notice the response of Abram.

232
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,080
The response of Abram.

233
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,240
Again, the reasoning of Sarai was not good reasoning,

234
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,920
and the response of Abram is not a good response.

235
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,320
At the end of verse number two, it says,

236
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,120
and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

237
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,520
And Sarai, Abram's wife, verse three,

238
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,760
took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian,

239
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,360
after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan,

240
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,360
and gave her to her husband, Abram, to be his wife.

241
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,320
And he, Abram, went in unto Hagar, and she conceived.

242
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,560
When she saw that she had conceived,

243
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,960
her mistress was despised in her eyes.

244
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,280
We see, first of all, in verse number two,

245
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,120
we think about the response of Abram.

246
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,120
It begins by him hearkening to the voice of Sarai.

247
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,920
He hears what Sarai says,

248
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,720
and we understand what's been recorded here

249
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,200
in Holy Scripture for us.

250
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
I'm not sure if there's been other discussions

251
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,800
that have taken place between Abram and Sarai.

252
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,480
We know that every conversation that they have

253
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,080
has not been recorded in Holy Scripture,

254
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,000
and I'm not sure, during that 10-year period,

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,240
how difficult it was.

256
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,640
I do know, however, that in chapter number 15,

257
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,480
that God, as he speaks to Abram,

258
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,640
and then as Abram speaks back to God,

259
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,960
that Abram voices a similar situation when he says,

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,640
behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

261
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,920
This was not a secret.

262
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,680
This was something that perhaps

263
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,080
had come up in conversation many times,

264
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,520
and now she's gotten this solution.

265
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
She's had this answer.

266
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,040
Abram, God has not allowed me to have children.

267
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,840
The Lord hath restrained me from bearing,

268
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
and here's the solution.

269
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,000
And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

270
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Verse number three records for us

271
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,800
the way in which the decision was made

272
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,680
and verse number four tells us

273
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,400
about the way in which Abram went in unto Hagar

274
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
and the consequence of that decision,

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,440
the fact that the Bible says,

276
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,920
and she conceived.

277
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,400
So we begin to consider the response of Abram

278
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,240
and it's just kind of a short point this evening.

279
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,160
I wonder this evening how often it is

280
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,680
that we respond to those

281
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,120
that have had improper reasoning.

282
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,240
See, the reality this evening

283
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,040
is that there are times in which

284
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,559
an individual as Sarai in this particular case

285
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,080
has reasoning that is not appropriate reasoning

286
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,160
and it requires a response.

287
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,080
Abram has been called of the Lord

288
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,240
as we find throughout the Scriptures

289
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,080
that he is to be the head of the home,

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,520
he is to be the spiritual leader in the home,

291
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
and there are times in which

292
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,840
the response to bad reasoning

293
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,120
does not need to be one of just hearkening to it.

294
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,400
And we find that this response of Abram

295
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,880
is a wrong response.

296
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,280
He hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

297
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,600
I want to focus this evening on our last point

298
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,280
and the results of their decision.

299
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,320
The results of their decision.

300
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,480
And really, it will take the remainder of the chapter,

301
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,000
but I want you to hold your place here

302
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,559
and I want you to turn over to the New Testament

303
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,240
and the book of Galatians

304
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
before we really dig into these results.

305
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,080
I want you to consider...

306
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,420
what God tells us in Galatians chapter number 6.

307
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,500
We visited this morning, verse number 10,

308
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,040
as we were dealing with the subject this morning,

309
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,000
this mortal shall put on immortality,

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,300
this mortal must put on immortality.

311
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,140
We talked about the opportunities that we have now,

312
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,520
and we looked at verse number 10,

313
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
but I want to draw your attention this evening

314
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,600
with regard to the subject matter of Genesis 16,

315
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,160
to Galatians 6 and verses 7 through 9.

316
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,300
The Bible says in verse number 7,

317
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,220
be not deceived, God is not mocked.

318
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,360
For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

319
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,520
God has established in His word a law

320
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,600
of sowing and reaping.

321
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,200
The reality is that we see this law in nature,

322
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,240
we understand the principle, the law

323
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,680
of sowing and reaping, if you want to have a harvest

324
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,880
of corn, you sow some seed, and after some time

325
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,040
of taking care of that seed and watering,

326
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
and so on and so forth, as the time would go forth,

327
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,880
you will reap a harvest of corn.

328
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,000
The principles are many.

329
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,960
You reap what you sow in like fashion.

330
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,520
The reality is that oftentimes you reap more than you sow.

331
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,960
And we find here that the Bible continues

332
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,080
in verse number 8, for he that soweth to his flesh

333
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,200
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

334
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,320
But he that soweth to the Spirit

335
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,440
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

336
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,720
I'm thankful this evening that though oftentimes

337
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
when we speak about the law of sowing and reaping

338
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,600
that we would speak of it in a negative context,

339
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,880
the reality is that there's a positive side to it as well.

340
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,680
If you sow some good seed, you'll reap some good fruit.

341
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,480
You sow bad seed, you're gonna reap some bad fruit.

342
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm thankful that the principle, the law has these two sides

343
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,600
and we understand this evening this truth.

344
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
And then notice in verse number 9,

345
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,040
and let us not be weary in well-doing,

346
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,920
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

347
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,360
The reality is that it's not often

348
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,360
that we reap as soon as we sow.

349
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,560
Now there are times in which we will obviously,

350
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,600
when I think about the decisions that we make,

351
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,160
there might be some immediate consequences.

352
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,640
When we really think about the law of sowing and reaping

353
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,480
and we understand this evening

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,360
that if I want to have a harvest in the fall,

355
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,160
that I need to be busy about doing some work in the spring

356
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,280
and preparing and cultivating

357
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,760
and getting the seed out of the barn

358
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
and all of the things that I need to do

359
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,400
in order to ensure a harvest.

360
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,520
I don't decide at harvest time,

361
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
hey, I better get that seed out of the barn.

362
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,200
No, there's just not enough time.

363
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
It's not gonna happen.

364
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,680
It's not gonna work.

365
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,320
In fact, there are many fruit trees

366
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,440
that take years to produce fruit.

367
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
You don't just decide,

368
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,840
I think I wanna have some apples in my yard next year.

369
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm gonna go buy an apple tree.

370
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
You're not gonna have apples next year.

371
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,520
Just not gonna work.

372
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,800
And so we understand this evening

373
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,160
that principle from nature and that law.

374
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,600
And in our lives, we understand,

375
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
as we'll look at this passage of scripture,

376
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,800
a couple of impacts of these decisions,

377
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,640
the results of their decision.

378
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
We've noticed their reasoning.

379
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,400
We've noticed the reasoning of Sarai,

380
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
the response of Abram.

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Now let's look at the results of their decision.

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,280
There were, if you're taking notes,

383
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,040
number one, there were some immediate consequences.

384
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,720
The Bible says at the end of verse number four

385
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,000
that her mistress was despised in her eyes.

386
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
As I would begin to consider this evening

387
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,600
the immediate consequences,

388
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
I would say that verses five and six,

389
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
really verse four, five, and six,

390
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,960
reveal to us some of the domestic relationships

391
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,120
that had some immediate consequences

392
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,400
to the decision that was made.

393
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,080
The reasoning led to a response,

394
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,960
and then there are some results.

395
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
And the Bible says in verse number five, notice,

396
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,400
and Sarai said unto Abram,

397
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
my wrong be upon thee.

398
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
I have given my maid into thy bosom,

399
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,680
and when she saw that she had conceived,

400
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,440
I was despised in her eyes.

401
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,760
The Lord judged between me and thee.

402
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
Now all of a sudden, there's domestic dispute going on.

403
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,640
There's problems at home.

404
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,400
There's contention between Sarai and Hagar.

405
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,080
There's contention between Abram and Sarai.

406
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,480
And we look at what's happening.

407
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,280
We find in verse number six that Abram said unto Sarai,

408
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,160
behold, thy maid is in thy hand.

409
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,600
Due to her is it pleaseth thee.

410
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,800
Notice what it says.

411
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,960
And when Sarai dealt hardly with her,

412
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
she fled from her face.

413
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
The Bible, as it uses that word, dealt hardly,

414
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
it means to deal harshly with her,

415
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,280
and she fled from her face.

416
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,360
Now this situation has gone downhill very rapidly.

417
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Sarai has some reasoning,

418
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,200
and it's revealed to us in verse number two.

419
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,120
And she comes to this place in her life

420
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,360
and she's reasoning through what's going on.

421
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,880
And she says, I have no children.

422
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
And she goes to her husband, to Abram,

423
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,960
and she says, I pray thee, go in unto my maid.

424
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,640
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

425
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,200
And maybe she did not expect things

426
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,720
to work out the way that they did.

427
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,560
The reality is that there are times

428
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,160
in which in our lives we make decisions

429
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,220
and we don't think the consequences

430
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,800
are gonna be what they are.

431
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,960
I didn't see that coming.

432
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,560
I didn't think it was gonna work that way.

433
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,480
I didn't think she was gonna respond that way

434
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,640
or he was gonna do this.

435
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,280
And here we find that Abram hearkened to Sarai.

436
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,840
He goes in unto Hagar.

437
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,640
She conceives, and the Bible says

438
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,080
that when she saw that she had conceived

439
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,560
that her mistress was despised in her eyes.

440
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,840
There becomes this contention between Sarai and Hagar.

441
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,960
And then Sarai goes to Abram and says,

442
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,360
my wrong be upon thee.

443
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,840
And we find that now Sarai, as Abram would say to her

444
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,200
in verse number six, thy maid is in thy hand,

445
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,920
do to her as it pleaseth thee,

446
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,480
that now Sarai will deal harshly, hardly with her.

447
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,420
And now Hagar flees.

448
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,880
As a side note, dealing with the consequences

449
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,160
of the results of the decisions,

450
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,720
we see that in verses number seven through 11,

451
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,960
that God reveals to us the situation

452
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,120
with Hagar fleeing and the angel of the Lord

453
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,000
appearing to her.

454
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,480
But I want you to think this evening

455
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,560
when we think about the results of the decision

456
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,880
that there were some immediate consequences.

457
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,080
In verse number seven, the Bible says,

458
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,680
and the angel of the Lord found her

459
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,000
by a fountain of water in the wilderness,

460
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,920
by the fountain in the way to Shur.

461
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,000
As we would look at Bible geography,

462
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,040
we would understand that what's happening here

463
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,640
is the Bible would describe for us in verse number seven

464
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
where the angel of the Lord found Hagar.

465
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,360
She was heading back to Egypt.

466
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,600
She was from Egypt.

467
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,520
She was an Egyptian.

468
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,200
We mentioned that in the beginning of the text of Scripture

469
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
at the beginning of our message this evening.

470
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,200
And now as the angel of the Lord would find her

471
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shur,

472
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,760
that she's heading back to Egypt.

473
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,840
Now it's interesting that as we begin to look here

474
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,520
as Hagar would depart and set out to return to Egypt,

475
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
that the angel of the Lord appears to her

476
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,880
and in so doing as we read these few verses of Scripture,

477
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,080
I believe that we see many of God's attributes on display.

478
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,760
I believe that we see the sovereignty of God.

479
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,880
I believe that we see the grace of God,

480
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
the omniscience of God, the eternality of God.

481
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,160
All of these things were in view here

482
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,840
in these verses of Scripture.

483
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,480
And notice with me in verse number eight,

484
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,640
he said, Hagar,

485
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,880
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou?

486
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,520
And whither wilt thou go?

487
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,560
And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

488
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,240
The angel of the Lord said unto her,

489
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,160
Return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands.

490
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,040
Now that's pretty direct instruction, is it not?

491
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,480
The angel of the Lord comes and gives direct instruction.

492
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,200
Now Sarai was the one that had dealt hardly with Hagar

493
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,920
and Hagar's response to that was that she fled from her face

494
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,640
and now the angel of the Lord appears

495
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,080
and the angel of the Lord refers to Hagar

496
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,119
as being Sarai's maid and says to her,

497
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,160
you need to return to thy mistress

498
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,799
and submit thyself under her hands.

499
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,000
Notice in verse number 10,

500
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,239
and the angel of the Lord said unto her,

501
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:54,000
I will multiply thy seed exceedingly

502
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,440
that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

503
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,480
And the angel of the Lord said unto her,

504
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,280
Behold, thou art with child,

505
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,360
and shalt bear a son,

506
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,280
and shalt call his name Ishmael,

507
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,080
because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

508
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,679
The name Ishmael means God shall hear.

509
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,080
We find that here in these verses of Scripture again,

510
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,000
as God would pursue the angel of the Lord

511
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,520
goes to where Hagar is as she's fleeing,

512
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,440
we'd see the grace of God.

513
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,960
We'd understand the omniscience and eternality of God

514
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,040
when the angel of the Lord says to her

515
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,679
that she is with child and that she shall bear a son.

516
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,640
When he says to her in verse number 10,

517
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
I will multiply thy seed exceedingly

518
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,200
that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

519
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,920
In verse number 11,

520
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,520
the angel of the Lord tells her of the name

521
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,080
that she shall call her son.

522
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
And notice in verse number 12,

523
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,160
and he will be a wild man.

524
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
His hand will be against her.

525
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,000
against every man and every man's hand against him,

526
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,760
and he shall dwell in the presence

527
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,520
of all his brethren."

528
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,680
This is where we transition from

529
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,560
those immediate consequences

530
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,880
that we read of in verses 4-6,

531
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,840
and now begin to look at some long-term consequences

532
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,000
of our decisions.

533
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You know, the reality is that there are times

534
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in which we make decisions

535
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,240
and there are some short-term consequences

536
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,920
and maybe they're not very comfortable,

537
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,280
they're not desirous, and we deal with them.

538
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,720
And sometimes we don't really even consider

539
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
what the long-term consequences may be.

540
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,040
But here in the text of Scripture,

541
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,400
we see that there are long-term consequences

542
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,000
that are revealed to us.

543
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,920
The first aspect is we find in v. 12,

544
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,760
the Bible says he, speaking of Ishmael,

545
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
will be a wild man.

546
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,560
The idea is that he would be unruly and stubborn.

547
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,160
We find the Bible then tells us in v. 12

548
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,600
that his hand will be against every man

549
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
and every man's hand against him,

550
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,440
and he shall dwell in the presence

551
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,800
of all his brethren.

552
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,840
We could look this evening not only

553
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,480
of the immediate descendants of Ishmael,

554
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,760
but we could find as we look historically

555
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,160
of the Arab nations that are the descendants of Ishmael,

556
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,400
and we could find how that even here

557
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,480
in Genesis 16,

558
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,920
there's this understanding of the turmoil,

559
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,880
the hostility, and the contention

560
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,040
that would be in their future.

561
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,920
That their hand, as it says in v. 12,

562
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,280
he will be a wild man,

563
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,800
his hand will be against every man,

564
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,240
and every man's hand against him,

565
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,280
and he shall dwell in the presence

566
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,240
of all his brethren.

567
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,800
This evening, if you're to study through history,

568
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,440
you'll find that exactly what God says here

569
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,400
in Genesis 16, in v. 12,

570
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,920
with regard to the descendants of Ishmael

571
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,960
has been seen throughout human history.

572
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,200
And we find that these are

573
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,960
what I would consider this evening,

574
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,880
this is a long-term consequence

575
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,080
to a decision that was made.

576
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
When you think about the time of Abram,

577
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
I mean thousands of years of human history

578
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,400
have passed, and we still see the consequences today

579
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,160
of this decision that is recorded

580
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,040
in Genesis 16.

581
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,960
We find the Bible continues in v. 13,

582
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,320
and she called the name of the Lord

583
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
that spake unto her.

584
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,280
Thou, God, seest me.

585
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
For she said,

586
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,560
Have I also here looked after him

587
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,840
that seeth me?

588
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,800
Wherefore, the well was called

589
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,160
Lehei Roy.

590
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,600
Behold, it is between Kadesh and Berid.

591
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,440
And Hagar bare Abram a son,

592
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,480
and Abram called his son's name,

593
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,840
which Hagar bare Ishmael.

594
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,360
And Abram was fourscore and six years old

595
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,560
when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

596
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,160
As we see in v. 14,

597
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,760
bare Lehei Roy,

598
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,680
that name of the well,

599
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,560
it means the well of him that liveth

600
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,200
and seeth me.

601
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,880
And I think that's quite interesting

602
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,440
as we understand this evening

603
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,280
that our God lives,

604
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,480
and our God sees us.

605
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,880
And He knows what we're dealing with.

606
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,720
He knows what we're experiencing in our lives,

607
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,800
and certainly there is comfort

608
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,400
in understanding that.

609
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,640
As we look at these results of this decision

610
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,880
that is recorded in Genesis 16,

611
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,640
again, I believe it's very easy for us tonight,

612
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
it's very easy for me in my study time

613
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,240
to just go to chapter 16 of the book of Genesis

614
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,400
knowing the content of what's going on

615
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
and just beginning by,

616
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,120
let's attack Abram and Sarai.

617
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Look at all the bad decisions they made.

618
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,600
I can't believe they did this

619
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,960
and so on and so forth.

620
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,840
But I took a step back

621
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,560
as I was studying the portion of scripture

622
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,120
and I began to deal with the reasoning

623
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,600
and looking at what's taking place

624
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,040
and asking and evaluating in my own life

625
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
how patient am I on waiting on God?

626
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,440
How much faith do I have when I wait on God?

627
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,280
It's easy for me to look at the results

628
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,440
of the decision that was made

629
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,040
in Genesis chapter number 16

630
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
and critique the decision that was made,

631
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,240
but the reality is that there are decisions

632
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,960
that I make and there are decisions that you make

633
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,280
that we don't know what the full consequences

634
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,240
are gonna be.

635
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,920
They're outside of our control.

636
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,960
There are immediate consequences,

637
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,680
but then there are long-term, far-reaching consequences.

638
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,960
And I would challenge you this evening

639
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,600
that as we look here at Genesis chapter number 16

640
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
and we consider the content of what God gives us

641
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,360
in this passage that we would be aware of the fact

642
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,440
that Abram and Sarai were human beings

643
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,160
and their humanity is on display

644
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,120
and the reality is that we all are human beings

645
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,800
and we are dealing with difficulties

646
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,360
and there are times in which somebody

647
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,920
might enter into our life and bring us some reasoning

648
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,680
that is not sound logic reasoning.

649
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,680
And if we're not careful, we can respond to that

650
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,920
and make some decisions that are not proper decisions

651
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,000
that will have some negative consequences.

652
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,760
Because there's principle in the Word of God law

653
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
with regard to sowing and reaping.

654
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,480
You understand this evening, no doubt,

655
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,680
that every decision that we make has consequences.

656
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,800
I read a humorous story this afternoon,

657
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,160
it really wasn't much of a story,

658
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,800
it was just a little clip and it was quite humorous

659
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,920
where someone was observing,

660
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,320
this of course was not in 2020, it was many years ago,

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,360
but they were observing that during this time of year,

662
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,800
the two most popular books at a bookstore

663
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
are the cookbook and the diet book.

664
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,200
And they were making fun of the fact

665
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,800
that you're trying to find out how to cook the food

666
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,920
and then trying to find out how to lose the weight

667
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
from eating the food.

668
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,000
And the reality is that every decision

669
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,440
that we make has consequences.

670
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,700
I mean, we understand that in the little things in life,

671
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,280
but sometimes we make decisions

672
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,400
that have far-reaching consequences,

673
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,180
long-term consequences.

674
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,280
I don't think Abram and Sarai

675
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,680
had any idea that thousands of years

676
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,120
after the decision that was made in Genesis 16

677
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,240
would still be having consequences today.

678
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,340
I just don't think they even considered that.

679
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,600
Many times in our lives, perhaps as parents,

680
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,600
we make decisions and perhaps we do not fully consider

681
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,920
the long-term impact and influence

682
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,040
that those decisions could have in our children,

683
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,260
in our grandchildren, because we're making decisions

684
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,720
and consequences are results of decisions.

685
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,040
Holly often has said to me over the years,

686
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm not sure where she first heard it,

687
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,840
but it's not that it's a very unpopular

688
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,640
kind of a thought or saying, it's well-known,

689
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,720
but what one generation does in moderation,

690
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,000
the next does in excess.

691
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,420
Begin to think about the consequences of our decisions

692
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,480
and what it is that we allow in our own lives

693
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,340
and what it is that we allow to be permitted

694
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,560
and so on and so forth and how those things

695
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,100
are going to impact a future generation.

696
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,140
And here in this passage of scripture,

697
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,180
we see the reasoning of Sarai,

698
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,380
poor reasoning, poor reasoning.

699
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,300
But before we get too critical on Sarai,

700
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,580
before you examine her life and criticize,

701
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,460
would you take a step back and evaluate your own life

702
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,100
and say, how's my reasoning?

703
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,240
Do I trust God?

704
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,540
Am I patient on waiting for God

705
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,220
to do what God said He would do?

706
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,140
Am I displaying, demonstrating faith in my life?

707
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,380
We see the response of Abram, poor response.

708
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,020
But again, before we, with a critical eye,

709
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,960
come and attack Abram for not being the man

710
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,060
that he was supposed to be and not opposing the idea

711
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,020
that was brought forth,

712
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,160
I wonder if we take a step back and evaluate.

713
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,660
What happens when someone comes to you

714
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,480
with some bad reasoning and gives you a suggestion

715
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,920
and idea, hey, we could handle it this way,

716
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,360
we could do it this way.

717
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Are we willing to stand up with a measure of sound logic

718
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,720
and reason and a measure of faith and say no?

719
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,060
God had given a promise to Abram.

720
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Abram, he responds to this reasoning of Sarai

721
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,040
and then we see the results.

722
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,600
I don't think for a moment that Abram and Sarai

723
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,480
thought about the far-reaching consequences,

724
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
but I would suggest to you this evening

725
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,420
that I don't even think they considered

726
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,380
the immediate consequences.

727
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,240
I don't think they thought it would work out this way.

728
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Oh, maybe that Sarai would have children through Hagar,

729
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,320
but not that it would have this level of effect and impact.

730
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,800
That it would cause that immediate contention

731
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,920
within the home, if you will.

732
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,720
And this evening, I just wonder if instead of critiquing

733
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,160
and criticizing and attacking,

734
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,480
if we would just simply take a step back

735
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
and evaluate our own lives and say,

736
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,320
how are we doing when we are facing with difficulties

737
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
and the decisions that we have to make?

738
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,460
How's my reasoning?

739
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,300
How's my faith?

740
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,800
How's my patience?

741
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,520
We see this evening in Genesis 16, the birth of Ishmael.

742
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,360
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us.

743
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,720
We thank You for the privilege

744
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,040
of being able to once again open Your Word.

745
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,580
And Lord, I hope this evening

746
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,640
that not one person has misunderstood

747
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,620
what I've sought to communicate this evening.

748
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,900
In no way, shape, or form am I commending

749
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,360
or saying that what was done

750
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,600
was understandable or appropriate.

751
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,400
These are poor decisions that were made

752
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,040
and this is chapter number 16.

753
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,200
God, I simply desire tonight

754
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,280
to learn from that which is recorded

755
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,000
in this passage of Scripture,

756
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,840
and that we as Your people today

757
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,960
would not just sit by and criticize,

758
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,200
but that we'd step back and evaluate.

759
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,840
Cause our reasoning.

760
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,920
Help us to be mindful this evening

761
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,200
that our decisions have consequences.

762
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,400
There are times in which we can sit back many years

763
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
and look at the consequences and wonder,

764
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,720
how did this ever happen?

765
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
To give an honest answer,

766
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,520
we'd have to dig and dig and dig

767
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,920
to go all the way back to that decision

768
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,320
that led to those consequences.

769
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,520
Help us, Lord, to have faith.

770
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Help us, Lord, to believe You.

771
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,080
Help us, Lord, to be patient.

772
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,960
I know that as Your children,

773
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,520
it's one of the hardest things that we do

774
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,440
is waiting on the Lord.

775
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,600
I pray, God, that You'd help us to endure.

776
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,840
I pray that You'd work in hearts and lives,

777
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,520
have Your will and way as only You can,

778
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,840
for it's in Christ's name we pray,

779
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Amen.
