WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
16. As I mentioned this morning, I'm so thankful for the Word of God and thankful that we're able

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.760
to have a copy of the Word of God and that we're speaking with someone this week and sharing with

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.040
them some of the ministries that we've done here at the church over the years and discussing the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.239
Bible assembly campaign and the opportunity to assemble scriptures. And we've not been able to

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:32.080
do that in 2020, but look forward to being able to get engaged with that ministry once again.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400
And what a blessing to be able to see the Word of God go around the world. In your Bible this

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.119
evening, Genesis chapter number 16, we'll be looking at the entire chapter, Genesis 16,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:45.759
looking at verses 1 through 16. And let me read the first verse. We'll dig into the scriptures

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:52.880
this evening. The Bible says, Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. And she had a handmaid,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.639
an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. If you look over in verse number 15 of our text,

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:04.879
the Bible says, And Hagar bare Abram a son. And Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.080
Ishmael. And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.040
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message, The Birth of Ishmael,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.160
The Birth of Ishmael. The content of Genesis 16 reveals to us the humanity of Abram and Sarai.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.440
As we think about the passage that we studied over the last few weeks in Genesis chapter number 15,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.680
and just the powerful truth that God gave us, and the way in which God came and spoke to Abram,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.360
and the conversation that they had, the dialogue, if you will, back and forth. And Abram receives

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.639
the promise of the Lord, and the promise with regard to the seed, the promise with regard to

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:54.720
the land, as we looked at last week. And we look at that Abrahamic covenant, as we often refer to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.519
it as, and what great truth is provided to us in Genesis chapter number 15. And we enter into

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:08.800
chapter number 16, and I believe that as we look at this passage, it is very possible that we can

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.559
examine this chapter with a critical eye. It is possible for us to, in fact, any portion of

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:22.160
Scripture, but especially this passage of Scripture with regard to the study that we've been doing

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.559
through the book of Genesis, it is possible that we enter into with that critical eye, and we critique

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:34.320
the behavior, the decisions of those. And at the onset of the message this evening,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.080
there are bad decisions that are made in Genesis chapter number 16, but as we look at the passage,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.320
I think that it's possible that if we examine the Scriptures with a critical eye, and we just

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.520
examine Genesis chapter number 16 with accusing and critiquing the decisions of Abram and Sarai,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.520
that it is very possible that in doing so, we may miss the lessons that God has for us to learn

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:07.279
from studying the event that is before us. I think most of us would agree this evening

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:14.320
that I'm glad that my life story hasn't been written down and recorded for generations of

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.679
people to read. The reality is that there are certain aspects of our lives, no doubt,

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:28.320
that have been recorded. There are times in which while I'm preaching, maybe I say something

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.679
in a twisted way. I put the words in the wrong order or something, and then that's recorded,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:38.479
and somebody can go back and look at it. But I think about Abram and Sarai, and I think about

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.679
the way in which their life and many of the events of their life are recorded in the pages of

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:50.399
Scripture. And they've been viewed, and they've been studied for generations of people. Not only

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:55.919
Abram and Sarai, many other of the characters in the Word of God. And we know that the only perfect

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.520
person is God. The Lord Jesus Christ came and lived a perfect and sinless life. And as we look

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.119
at Genesis chapter number 16, I believe that the record reveals to us the humanity of these

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:14.639
individuals. The fact that they deal with some of the same difficulties that we deal with.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.920
Listen, we're not always as patient as we ought to be. Amen? We don't always have the faith that

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.600
we ought to have. We don't always live in obedience to the commands that God has given us.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.239
And if we're not careful, we can, with a critical eye, look at a passage of Scripture such as this

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:36.239
one and say, they should have done this, and they should have done that. And I understand, we'll

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:41.359
share some of those things this evening. But all my prayer tonight as we look at this passage is

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:48.079
that we would learn from that which is recorded, and we would be able to make good decisions in

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:53.839
our own lives. As we're going to dig into the passage and look at the entirety of the chapter,

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:59.679
I do think that it's important to really dissect verse number one just for a moment as it helps to

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:06.000
set the scene as to that which would unfold in Genesis chapter number 16. Notice with me,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.040
the Bible begins and tells us, Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. Now this is a recurring

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:22.079
statement or theme throughout the Scriptures with regard to our first introduction to Abram and

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:28.000
Sarai. In fact, if you go back to Genesis chapter number 11, and you find that as God would provide

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.720
us with the history of Abraham and the generations of Terah as they begin in verse number 27,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.320
the Bible tells us in Genesis 11 and verse number 30, But Sarai was barren, she had no child.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.600
The Bible tells us, even as we studied the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis over the last few

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:58.959
weeks, that Abram said in verse number 3 of Genesis 15, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.480
And of course, God's response when Abram says that one born in mine house is mine heir,

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:13.119
God said to him, This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:21.359
shall be thine heir. We come to chapter number 16 and we once again are reminded of this situation

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:29.519
in which the Bible tells us that Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children. Now the Bible continues

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:36.880
to go on and it introduces us to someone that is her handmaid. It says, And she, Sarai, had

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:46.559
a handmaid. Notice this, an Egyptian whose name was Hagar. I'm not sure how often you have really

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:53.839
considered the content of Genesis 16 or how much time you've spent at really trying to figure out

00:06:53.839 --> 00:07:00.000
where did this Hagar come from. We know the Bible says that she's an Egyptian, but I would encourage

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.040
you just for a moment to turn back to Genesis chapter number 12. You'll recall with me in Genesis

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.600
chapter number 12, as God had called Abram to leave the Ur of the Chaldees, as it is mentioned

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.239
at the end of chapter 11, the beginning of chapter number 12, that as they get into the land, as they

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:21.279
get to that place where God had promised them to go, it tells us in verse number five, And Abram

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:26.320
took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.200
and the souls that they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.440
and into the land of Canaan, they came. And we find that in verse number 10, the Bible says that

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.359
there was a famine in the land. If you remember, as we studied this portion of Scripture, that we

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:53.600
spoke about the plan of God and how God and his wisdom and knowledge that he led Abram and his

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.399
family to go to this place at this time, and yet as they arrive, they encounter this famine. And

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:08.959
the Bible tells us that Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:15.279
in the land. Of course, we understand that while Abram and Sarai and Lot and those servants that

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:21.920
he had went down into Egypt, that the Bible tells us that Abram's greatest concern was for his wife

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.640
Sarai, and he said, Tell them that you're my sister, because they're going to see you, and

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.239
they're going to see that you're beautiful, and they're going to kill me for your sake.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.440
We find that God miraculously took care of Sarai and Abram, and God dealt with Pharaoh. We studied

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.000
this a number of weeks ago, and we find that the Bible tells us that Abram and his wife and his

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.359
family, they leave in verse number one of chapter 13, it says, and Abram went up out of Egypt,

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:55.119
he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him into the south. I do not believe that I can

00:08:55.119 --> 00:09:03.520
prove it biblically that Hagar became a handmaid during this particular trip, but it certainly

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.440
seems to be the case. And we find that it's important for us to understand that even the

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.479
decisions that we make, and in this particular context as we look at a timeline, that it will

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:22.320
perhaps have consequences later on down the road. And we find that even here in Genesis chapter

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.599
number 16, that will be a recurring thought throughout the message this evening. But we find

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:34.960
that the Bible introduces us not only or reminds us of the situation of Sarai being barren, having

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:42.159
no children, but also the Scriptures introduce us to this one named Hagar, who was an Egyptian.

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:45.919
Now, as we dig into the passage, I want you to notice first of all, if you're taking points,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:54.080
the reasoning of Sarai. In verse number two, God gives us a glimpse into the reasoning of Sarai.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.840
The Bible says in verse number two, and Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now the Lord hath

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.160
that restrained me from bearing.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.240
I pray Thee, go in unto my maid.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.040
It may be that I may obtain children by her."

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.120
As we begin to think,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.720
and we'll read verse 2 in just a moment,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.280
as we begin to think about the reasoning of Sarai

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.000
and we see her perspective in verse 2

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.320
in this beginning section of this verse of Scripture,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.400
that she goes to her husband

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.600
and she says she identifies

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.400
what has already been well known.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.920
We know that she's barren.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.520
We know that Abram had already spoken to God

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.080
in chapter number 15 about having no seed.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.240
And we find that she says to her husband,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.400
the Lord hath restrained me from bearing.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.880
Now look at the logic, the reasoning, if you will.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.640
She says, I pray Thee, go in unto my maid.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.200
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.000
As we would think about the thought,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.840
the reasoning, and the perspective,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.080
I would say that it was one of sight and not of faith.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.600
I would say that when we look at what's taking place here,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.600
that what is being said was something that was legitimate

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.080
with regard to the society in which they lived.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.760
It was certainly something that had taken place

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.720
and something that they were aware of

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.680
that she, as being barren,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.480
could have children through her handmaid.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.280
And we find that she's going to,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.480
with this reasoning and this logic,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.480
she's going to bring this idea to Abram.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.000
And I want you to just stop and think for a moment.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.040
I want you to consider with me

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.520
that as we think about the situation

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.480
and we think about all that Abram and Sarai have dealt with,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.920
I want you to consider with me

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.360
that it's been 10 years since they left the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.720
I want you to consider with me

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.720
that when they received that call,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.400
when Abram received that call in chapter 12,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.160
that he had received the fact

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.800
that God would make of thee a great nation,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.440
I will bless thee and make thy name great.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.280
He goes through and he gives them these promises,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.000
and of course, they're repeated throughout the Scriptures.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.800
At that particular time, Abram is 75 years old.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.520
By the end of chapter 16,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.200
we'll find that Abram is 86 years old.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.640
And so there's a period of just about 10 years that goes by.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.240
And after 10 years of waiting,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.760
and after 10 years of not having any children,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.240
we find that it's come to the place

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.240
where it's adversely affected the reasoning of Sarai.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.160
She begins to have a sight answer to the problem

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.880
instead of a faith solution to the problem.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.680
I think that when we would evaluate our circumstances

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.480
and our situations that we face,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.520
I would wonder this evening

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.240
as we have decisions that we have to make,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.760
what is it that we go through as a process?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.800
What is it that we begin to evaluate?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320
Where does the promise of God

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.120
lay within our decision-making process?

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.040
See, the reality this evening

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.000
is there are times in which many of us

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.600
have not waited 10 years for God to do something.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.200
10 years is a long time.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.080
10 years is a very long time.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.200
They're older, they've heard this promise,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.560
but she's barren.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.680
She's had no children.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.360
They look at society and they see

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.760
that this is a practice that is accepted.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.880
And so she begins to, in her mind,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.200
as we think about her reasoning,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.600
she comes to this conclusion.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.040
Again, I believe it's the wrong conclusion,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.560
but I wonder this evening,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.120
can we relate a little bit with Sarai?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.160
Can we, instead of criticizing her,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.920
try to learn from her?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720
I'm not in any way suggesting

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.880
that she made a good decision.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.840
She didn't, it was a terrible decision.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.800
But there are times in which we make terrible decisions

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.920
and we've not waited 10 minutes for God.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.320
10 years is a long time.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.320
The Bible tells us that she says,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.160
I pray thee, go in unto my maid.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.280
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.080
I wonder how many different ways

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.840
we could apply the thought this evening

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.600
from this passage of Scripture

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.320
and how there are times in which

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.880
we try to take matters in our own hands.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.480
That we try to manipulate circumstances

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.640
or to build something.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.240
We're not waiting on God.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.160
We know that God's promised to work.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.480
We know that He's given us promises

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.040
that I'm gonna build the church

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.440
and He's given us a pattern,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.800
a plan, if you will, on how to reach the world

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.880
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.200
But I wonder, have we stuck to the plan?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.400
Are we doing what God said?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.760
Or do we just kinda, you know what?

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.280
That's not working and we're tired of waiting.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.240
And see here, Sarai, it's a terrible decision.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.400
Again, I wanna repeat that.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.800
I wanna make sure that we understand this evening

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.600
that I'm not saying that this is a right decision.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.520
I'm simply suggesting this evening

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.600
that I can understand how someone

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.320
could make a wrong decision

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.680
when our reasoning is getting messed up.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.200
When we're looking at it by sight

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.160
and not by faith.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.280
When we say, I look at my own resources,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.040
and again, they're stricken in years,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.360
when we say, this is not happening.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.800
I'm barren and maybe you can have a child in this manner.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.680
Maybe it is that I would obtain children by her.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.480
See, this evening, instead of criticizing Sarai,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.800
I wonder if we would evaluate our own lives

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.280
and decisions and ask ourselves,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.720
how much patience and faith do we have?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.920
How much patience and faith do we have

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.720
on waiting on the promises of God?

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.960
In allowing God to work

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.160
in a way that only He will work?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
In a way that would only bring honor and glory to His name?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.400
We see the reasoning of Sarai, number two.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.520
If you're taking notes at the end of verse number two

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.280
and down through verse number four,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.760
I want you to notice the response of Abram.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.080
The response of Abram.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.240
Again, the reasoning of Sarai was not good reasoning,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.920
and the response of Abram is not a good response.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.320
At the end of verse number two, it says,

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.120
and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.520
And Sarai, Abram's wife, verse three,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.760
took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.360
after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.360
and gave her to her husband, Abram, to be his wife.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.320
And he, Abram, went in unto Hagar, and she conceived.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.560
When she saw that she had conceived,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.960
her mistress was despised in her eyes.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.280
We see, first of all, in verse number two,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.120
we think about the response of Abram.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.120
It begins by him hearkening to the voice of Sarai.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.920
He hears what Sarai says,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.720
and we understand what's been recorded here

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.200
in Holy Scripture for us.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.880
I'm not sure if there's been other discussions

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.800
that have taken place between Abram and Sarai.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.480
We know that every conversation that they have

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.080
has not been recorded in Holy Scripture,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.000
and I'm not sure, during that 10-year period,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.240
how difficult it was.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.640
I do know, however, that in chapter number 15,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.480
that God, as he speaks to Abram,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.640
and then as Abram speaks back to God,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.960
that Abram voices a similar situation when he says,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.640
behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.920
This was not a secret.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.680
This was something that perhaps

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.080
had come up in conversation many times,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.520
and now she's gotten this solution.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.200
She's had this answer.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.040
Abram, God has not allowed me to have children.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.840
The Lord hath restrained me from bearing,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.360
and here's the solution.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.000
And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.240
Verse number three records for us

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.800
the way in which the decision was made

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.680
and verse number four tells us

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.400
about the way in which Abram went in unto Hagar

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.000
and the consequence of that decision,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.440
the fact that the Bible says,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.920
and she conceived.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.400
So we begin to consider the response of Abram

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.240
and it's just kind of a short point this evening.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.160
I wonder this evening how often it is

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.680
that we respond to those

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.120
that have had improper reasoning.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.240
See, the reality this evening

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.040
is that there are times in which

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.559
an individual as Sarai in this particular case

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:11.080
has reasoning that is not appropriate reasoning

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.160
and it requires a response.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.080
Abram has been called of the Lord

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.240
as we find throughout the Scriptures

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.080
that he is to be the head of the home,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.520
he is to be the spiritual leader in the home,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.040
and there are times in which

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.840
the response to bad reasoning

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.120
does not need to be one of just hearkening to it.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.400
And we find that this response of Abram

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.880
is a wrong response.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.280
He hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.600
I want to focus this evening on our last point

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.280
and the results of their decision.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.320
The results of their decision.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.480
And really, it will take the remainder of the chapter,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.000
but I want you to hold your place here

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.559
and I want you to turn over to the New Testament

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.240
and the book of Galatians

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.559
before we really dig into these results.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.080
I want you to consider...

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.420
what God tells us in Galatians chapter number 6.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.500
We visited this morning, verse number 10,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.040
as we were dealing with the subject this morning,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.000
this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.300
this mortal must put on immortality.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.140
We talked about the opportunities that we have now,

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.520
and we looked at verse number 10,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.560
but I want to draw your attention this evening

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.600
with regard to the subject matter of Genesis 16,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.160
to Galatians 6 and verses 7 through 9.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.300
The Bible says in verse number 7,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.220
be not deceived, God is not mocked.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.360
For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.520
God has established in His word a law

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.600
of sowing and reaping.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.200
The reality is that we see this law in nature,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.240
we understand the principle, the law

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.680
of sowing and reaping, if you want to have a harvest

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.880
of corn, you sow some seed, and after some time

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.040
of taking care of that seed and watering,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.040
and so on and so forth, as the time would go forth,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.880
you will reap a harvest of corn.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.000
The principles are many.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.960
You reap what you sow in like fashion.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.520
The reality is that oftentimes you reap more than you sow.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.960
And we find here that the Bible continues

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.080
in verse number 8, for he that soweth to his flesh

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.200
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.320
But he that soweth to the Spirit

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.440
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.720
I'm thankful this evening that though oftentimes

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.640
when we speak about the law of sowing and reaping

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.600
that we would speak of it in a negative context,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.880
the reality is that there's a positive side to it as well.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.680
If you sow some good seed, you'll reap some good fruit.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.480
You sow bad seed, you're gonna reap some bad fruit.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.480
I'm thankful that the principle, the law has these two sides

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.600
and we understand this evening this truth.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.120
And then notice in verse number 9,

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.040
and let us not be weary in well-doing,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.920
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.360
The reality is that it's not often

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.360
that we reap as soon as we sow.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.560
Now there are times in which we will obviously,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.600
when I think about the decisions that we make,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.160
there might be some immediate consequences.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.640
When we really think about the law of sowing and reaping

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.480
and we understand this evening

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.360
that if I want to have a harvest in the fall,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.160
that I need to be busy about doing some work in the spring

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.280
and preparing and cultivating

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.760
and getting the seed out of the barn

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.920
and all of the things that I need to do

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.400
in order to ensure a harvest.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.520
I don't decide at harvest time,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.360
hey, I better get that seed out of the barn.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.200
No, there's just not enough time.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.080
It's not gonna happen.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.680
It's not gonna work.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.320
In fact, there are many fruit trees

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.440
that take years to produce fruit.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.960
You don't just decide,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.840
I think I wanna have some apples in my yard next year.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.120
I'm gonna go buy an apple tree.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.120
You're not gonna have apples next year.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.520
Just not gonna work.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.800
And so we understand this evening

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.160
that principle from nature and that law.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.600
And in our lives, we understand,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.840
as we'll look at this passage of scripture,

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.800
a couple of impacts of these decisions,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.640
the results of their decision.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.160
We've noticed their reasoning.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.400
We've noticed the reasoning of Sarai,

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.000
the response of Abram.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Now let's look at the results of their decision.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.280
There were, if you're taking notes,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.040
number one, there were some immediate consequences.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.720
The Bible says at the end of verse number four

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.000
that her mistress was despised in her eyes.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.080
As I would begin to consider this evening

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.600
the immediate consequences,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.000
I would say that verses five and six,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.800
really verse four, five, and six,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.960
reveal to us some of the domestic relationships

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.120
that had some immediate consequences

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.400
to the decision that was made.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.080
The reasoning led to a response,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.960
and then there are some results.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.760
And the Bible says in verse number five, notice,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.400
and Sarai said unto Abram,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400
my wrong be upon thee.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.240
I have given my maid into thy bosom,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.680
and when she saw that she had conceived,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.440
I was despised in her eyes.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.760
The Lord judged between me and thee.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.240
Now all of a sudden, there's domestic dispute going on.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.640
There's problems at home.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.400
There's contention between Sarai and Hagar.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.080
There's contention between Abram and Sarai.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.480
And we look at what's happening.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.280
We find in verse number six that Abram said unto Sarai,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.160
behold, thy maid is in thy hand.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.600
Due to her is it pleaseth thee.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.800
Notice what it says.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.960
And when Sarai dealt hardly with her,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.360
she fled from her face.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.400
The Bible, as it uses that word, dealt hardly,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.960
it means to deal harshly with her,

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.280
and she fled from her face.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.360
Now this situation has gone downhill very rapidly.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.080
Sarai has some reasoning,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.200
and it's revealed to us in verse number two.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.120
And she comes to this place in her life

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.360
and she's reasoning through what's going on.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.880
And she says, I have no children.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.200
And she goes to her husband, to Abram,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.960
and she says, I pray thee, go in unto my maid.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.640
It may be that I may obtain children by her.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.200
And maybe she did not expect things

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.720
to work out the way that they did.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.560
The reality is that there are times

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.160
in which in our lives we make decisions

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.220
and we don't think the consequences

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.800
are gonna be what they are.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.960
I didn't see that coming.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.560
I didn't think it was gonna work that way.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.480
I didn't think she was gonna respond that way

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.640
or he was gonna do this.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.280
And here we find that Abram hearkened to Sarai.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.840
He goes in unto Hagar.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.640
She conceives, and the Bible says

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.080
that when she saw that she had conceived

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.560
that her mistress was despised in her eyes.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.840
There becomes this contention between Sarai and Hagar.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.960
And then Sarai goes to Abram and says,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.360
my wrong be upon thee.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.840
And we find that now Sarai, as Abram would say to her

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.200
in verse number six, thy maid is in thy hand,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.920
do to her as it pleaseth thee,

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.480
that now Sarai will deal harshly, hardly with her.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.420
And now Hagar flees.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.880
As a side note, dealing with the consequences

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.160
of the results of the decisions,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.720
we see that in verses number seven through 11,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.960
that God reveals to us the situation

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.120
with Hagar fleeing and the angel of the Lord

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.000
appearing to her.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.480
But I want you to think this evening

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.560
when we think about the results of the decision

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.880
that there were some immediate consequences.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.080
In verse number seven, the Bible says,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.680
and the angel of the Lord found her

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.000
by a fountain of water in the wilderness,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.920
by the fountain in the way to Shur.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.000
As we would look at Bible geography,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.040
we would understand that what's happening here

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.640
is the Bible would describe for us in verse number seven

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.880
where the angel of the Lord found Hagar.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.360
She was heading back to Egypt.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.600
She was from Egypt.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.520
She was an Egyptian.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.200
We mentioned that in the beginning of the text of Scripture

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.600
at the beginning of our message this evening.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.200
And now as the angel of the Lord would find her

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.080
in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shur,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.760
that she's heading back to Egypt.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.840
Now it's interesting that as we begin to look here

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.520
as Hagar would depart and set out to return to Egypt,

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.520
that the angel of the Lord appears to her

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.880
and in so doing as we read these few verses of Scripture,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.080
I believe that we see many of God's attributes on display.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.760
I believe that we see the sovereignty of God.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.880
I believe that we see the grace of God,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.480
the omniscience of God, the eternality of God.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.160
All of these things were in view here

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.840
in these verses of Scripture.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.480
And notice with me in verse number eight,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.640
he said, Hagar,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.880
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou?

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.520
And whither wilt thou go?

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.560
And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.240
The angel of the Lord said unto her,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:22.160
Return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.040
Now that's pretty direct instruction, is it not?

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.480
The angel of the Lord comes and gives direct instruction.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.200
Now Sarai was the one that had dealt hardly with Hagar

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.920
and Hagar's response to that was that she fled from her face

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.640
and now the angel of the Lord appears

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.080
and the angel of the Lord refers to Hagar

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.119
as being Sarai's maid and says to her,

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:45.160
you need to return to thy mistress

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.799
and submit thyself under her hands.

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.000
Notice in verse number 10,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.239
and the angel of the Lord said unto her,

00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:54.000
I will multiply thy seed exceedingly

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.440
that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.480
And the angel of the Lord said unto her,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.280
Behold, thou art with child,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.360
and shalt bear a son,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.280
and shalt call his name Ishmael,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.080
because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.679
The name Ishmael means God shall hear.

00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:18.080
We find that here in these verses of Scripture again,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.000
as God would pursue the angel of the Lord

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.520
goes to where Hagar is as she's fleeing,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.440
we'd see the grace of God.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.960
We'd understand the omniscience and eternality of God

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.040
when the angel of the Lord says to her

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.679
that she is with child and that she shall bear a son.

00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:39.640
When he says to her in verse number 10,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.440
I will multiply thy seed exceedingly

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.200
that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.920
In verse number 11,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.520
the angel of the Lord tells her of the name

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.080
that she shall call her son.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.960
And notice in verse number 12,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.160
and he will be a wild man.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.160
His hand will be against her.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.000
against every man and every man's hand against him,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.760
and he shall dwell in the presence

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.520
of all his brethren."

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.680
This is where we transition from

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.560
those immediate consequences

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.880
that we read of in verses 4-6,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.840
and now begin to look at some long-term consequences

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.000
of our decisions.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
You know, the reality is that there are times

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
in which we make decisions

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.240
and there are some short-term consequences

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.920
and maybe they're not very comfortable,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.280
they're not desirous, and we deal with them.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.720
And sometimes we don't really even consider

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.000
what the long-term consequences may be.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.040
But here in the text of Scripture,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.400
we see that there are long-term consequences

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.000
that are revealed to us.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.920
The first aspect is we find in v. 12,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.760
the Bible says he, speaking of Ishmael,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.080
will be a wild man.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.560
The idea is that he would be unruly and stubborn.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.160
We find the Bible then tells us in v. 12

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.600
that his hand will be against every man

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.800
and every man's hand against him,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.440
and he shall dwell in the presence

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.800
of all his brethren.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.840
We could look this evening not only

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.480
of the immediate descendants of Ishmael,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.760
but we could find as we look historically

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.160
of the Arab nations that are the descendants of Ishmael,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.400
and we could find how that even here

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.480
in Genesis 16,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.920
there's this understanding of the turmoil,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.880
the hostility, and the contention

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.040
that would be in their future.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.920
That their hand, as it says in v. 12,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.280
he will be a wild man,

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.800
his hand will be against every man,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.240
and every man's hand against him,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.280
and he shall dwell in the presence

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.240
of all his brethren.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.800
This evening, if you're to study through history,

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.440
you'll find that exactly what God says here

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.400
in Genesis 16, in v. 12,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.920
with regard to the descendants of Ishmael

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.960
has been seen throughout human history.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.200
And we find that these are

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.960
what I would consider this evening,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.880
this is a long-term consequence

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.080
to a decision that was made.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.840
When you think about the time of Abram,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.120
I mean thousands of years of human history

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.400
have passed, and we still see the consequences today

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.160
of this decision that is recorded

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.040
in Genesis 16.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.960
We find the Bible continues in v. 13,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.320
and she called the name of the Lord

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.840
that spake unto her.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.280
Thou, God, seest me.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.520
For she said,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.560
Have I also here looked after him

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.840
that seeth me?

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.800
Wherefore, the well was called

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.160
Lehei Roy.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.600
Behold, it is between Kadesh and Berid.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.440
And Hagar bare Abram a son,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.480
and Abram called his son's name,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.840
which Hagar bare Ishmael.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.360
And Abram was fourscore and six years old

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.560
when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.160
As we see in v. 14,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.760
bare Lehei Roy,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.680
that name of the well,

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.560
it means the well of him that liveth

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.200
and seeth me.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.880
And I think that's quite interesting

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.440
as we understand this evening

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.280
that our God lives,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.480
and our God sees us.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.880
And He knows what we're dealing with.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.720
He knows what we're experiencing in our lives,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.800
and certainly there is comfort

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.400
in understanding that.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.640
As we look at these results of this decision

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.880
that is recorded in Genesis 16,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.640
again, I believe it's very easy for us tonight,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.960
it's very easy for me in my study time

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.240
to just go to chapter 16 of the book of Genesis

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.400
knowing the content of what's going on

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.520
and just beginning by,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.120
let's attack Abram and Sarai.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.120
Look at all the bad decisions they made.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.600
I can't believe they did this

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.960
and so on and so forth.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.840
But I took a step back

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.560
as I was studying the portion of scripture

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.120
and I began to deal with the reasoning

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.600
and looking at what's taking place

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.040
and asking and evaluating in my own life

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.400
how patient am I on waiting on God?

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.440
How much faith do I have when I wait on God?

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.280
It's easy for me to look at the results

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.440
of the decision that was made

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.040
in Genesis chapter number 16

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.040
and critique the decision that was made,

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.240
but the reality is that there are decisions

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.960
that I make and there are decisions that you make

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.280
that we don't know what the full consequences

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.240
are gonna be.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.920
They're outside of our control.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.960
There are immediate consequences,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.680
but then there are long-term, far-reaching consequences.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.960
And I would challenge you this evening

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.600
that as we look here at Genesis chapter number 16

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.600
and we consider the content of what God gives us

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.360
in this passage that we would be aware of the fact

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.440
that Abram and Sarai were human beings

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.160
and their humanity is on display

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.120
and the reality is that we all are human beings

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.800
and we are dealing with difficulties

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.360
and there are times in which somebody

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.920
might enter into our life and bring us some reasoning

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.680
that is not sound logic reasoning.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.680
And if we're not careful, we can respond to that

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.920
and make some decisions that are not proper decisions

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.000
that will have some negative consequences.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.760
Because there's principle in the Word of God law

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.760
with regard to sowing and reaping.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.480
You understand this evening, no doubt,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.680
that every decision that we make has consequences.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.800
I read a humorous story this afternoon,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.160
it really wasn't much of a story,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.800
it was just a little clip and it was quite humorous

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.920
where someone was observing,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.320
this of course was not in 2020, it was many years ago,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.360
but they were observing that during this time of year,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.800
the two most popular books at a bookstore

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.520
are the cookbook and the diet book.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.200
And they were making fun of the fact

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.800
that you're trying to find out how to cook the food

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.920
and then trying to find out how to lose the weight

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.320
from eating the food.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.000
And the reality is that every decision

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.440
that we make has consequences.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.700
I mean, we understand that in the little things in life,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.280
but sometimes we make decisions

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.400
that have far-reaching consequences,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.180
long-term consequences.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.280
I don't think Abram and Sarai

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.680
had any idea that thousands of years

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.120
after the decision that was made in Genesis 16

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.240
would still be having consequences today.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.340
I just don't think they even considered that.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.600
Many times in our lives, perhaps as parents,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.600
we make decisions and perhaps we do not fully consider

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.920
the long-term impact and influence

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.040
that those decisions could have in our children,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.260
in our grandchildren, because we're making decisions

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.720
and consequences are results of decisions.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.040
Holly often has said to me over the years,

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.880
I'm not sure where she first heard it,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.840
but it's not that it's a very unpopular

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.640
kind of a thought or saying, it's well-known,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.720
but what one generation does in moderation,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.000
the next does in excess.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.420
Begin to think about the consequences of our decisions

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.480
and what it is that we allow in our own lives

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.340
and what it is that we allow to be permitted

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.560
and so on and so forth and how those things

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.100
are going to impact a future generation.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.140
And here in this passage of scripture,

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.180
we see the reasoning of Sarai,

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.380
poor reasoning, poor reasoning.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.300
But before we get too critical on Sarai,

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.580
before you examine her life and criticize,

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.460
would you take a step back and evaluate your own life

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.100
and say, how's my reasoning?

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.240
Do I trust God?

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.540
Am I patient on waiting for God

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.220
to do what God said He would do?

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.140
Am I displaying, demonstrating faith in my life?

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.380
We see the response of Abram, poor response.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.020
But again, before we, with a critical eye,

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.960
come and attack Abram for not being the man

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.060
that he was supposed to be and not opposing the idea

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.020
that was brought forth,

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.160
I wonder if we take a step back and evaluate.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.660
What happens when someone comes to you

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.480
with some bad reasoning and gives you a suggestion

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.920
and idea, hey, we could handle it this way,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.360
we could do it this way.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.360
Are we willing to stand up with a measure of sound logic

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.720
and reason and a measure of faith and say no?

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.060
God had given a promise to Abram.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.320
Abram, he responds to this reasoning of Sarai

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.040
and then we see the results.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.600
I don't think for a moment that Abram and Sarai

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.480
thought about the far-reaching consequences,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.000
but I would suggest to you this evening

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.420
that I don't even think they considered

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.380
the immediate consequences.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.240
I don't think they thought it would work out this way.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.700
Oh, maybe that Sarai would have children through Hagar,

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.320
but not that it would have this level of effect and impact.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.800
That it would cause that immediate contention

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.920
within the home, if you will.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.720
And this evening, I just wonder if instead of critiquing

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.160
and criticizing and attacking,

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.480
if we would just simply take a step back

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.960
and evaluate our own lives and say,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.320
how are we doing when we are facing with difficulties

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.840
and the decisions that we have to make?

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.460
How's my reasoning?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.300
How's my faith?

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.800
How's my patience?

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.520
We see this evening in Genesis 16, the birth of Ishmael.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.360
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.720
We thank You for the privilege

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.040
of being able to once again open Your Word.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.580
And Lord, I hope this evening

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.640
that not one person has misunderstood

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.620
what I've sought to communicate this evening.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.900
In no way, shape, or form am I commending

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.360
or saying that what was done

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.600
was understandable or appropriate.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.400
These are poor decisions that were made

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.040
and this is chapter number 16.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.200
God, I simply desire tonight

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.280
to learn from that which is recorded

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.000
in this passage of Scripture,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.840
and that we as Your people today

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.960
would not just sit by and criticize,

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:55.200
but that we'd step back and evaluate.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.840
Cause our reasoning.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.920
Help us to be mindful this evening

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.200
that our decisions have consequences.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.400
There are times in which we can sit back many years

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.440
and look at the consequences and wonder,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.720
how did this ever happen?

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.840
To give an honest answer,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.520
we'd have to dig and dig and dig

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.920
to go all the way back to that decision

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.320
that led to those consequences.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.520
Help us, Lord, to have faith.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.520
Help us, Lord, to believe You.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.080
Help us, Lord, to be patient.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.960
I know that as Your children,

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.520
it's one of the hardest things that we do

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.440
is waiting on the Lord.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.600
I pray, God, that You'd help us to endure.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.840
I pray that You'd work in hearts and lives,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.520
have Your will and way as only You can,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.840
for it's in Christ's name we pray,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840
Amen.
