1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
This evening mark chapter number six as you're turning there. Happy anniversary to Holly tomorrow

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,479
We get to celebrate 19 years of marriage. Amen, and

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,199
Praise the Lord next year is a big year

4

20 and so very thankful for that

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,079
we celebrate at nine years of ministry here just a couple of weeks ago and very thankful for God's blessing and

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,840
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,000
Amen, and I am so thankful for Holly and for the blessing that she's been to me mark chapter number six

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm gonna read a couple of verses of Scripture and

9
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,599
Then we're gonna dig in I'm gonna look at a number of

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,939
passages here between Matthew and Mark and look at a passage in Luke and deal with the subject matter this evening gonna be more of

11
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,599
a topical study

12
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll let you know that right in advance, but mark chapter number six

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,040
I just want to look at verse five and six look at verse four with me

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,599
It says this but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor

15
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:57,279
but in his own country and among his own kin and his own house

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
this verse number five and

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,519
He couldn't could there do no mighty works

18
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:13,199
save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and then notice this statement in verse number six and

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,279
He marveled because of their unbelief

20
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:22,120
And he went round about the villages

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Teaching and

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
He marveled

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Because of their unbelief

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,819
This evening. I want to preach a message that I've simply entitled he marveled because of their unbelief

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,080
It's interesting as you study the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ through the gospel records

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,739
We have the opportunity to see him interacting with a number of folks

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,540
In fact, obviously as you study the Gospels you see much interaction with the disciples

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:57,180
but you find that as Jesus traveled through the Holy Land and as he went from city to city to village to village as he

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:05,120
During those three and a half or so years of ministry public ministry the interactions that he had and the gospel records record for us

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,339
Some of those interactions and it's really interesting as you would consider

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,339
what it is that the Lord said on a number of different occasions with regard to the faith of

32
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,619
Some of those that he interacted with

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,820
Hold your place here in Mark because we're gonna come back here

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,860
But turn over to the book of Matthew if you will in Matthew chapter number 8 in Matthew chapter number 8 really the first several

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
verses verse number 5 down through

36
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,380
around verse number 13 or so

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,580
We see that there's a a record here given of this miracle that took place and it's with this

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,660
Centurion and in Matthew 8 in verse number 10 as Jesus is interacting with this centurion

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,820
I want you to see what the Bible says in verse number 10. It says when Jesus heard it notice this he marveled

40
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,259
We just saw that same word in Mark chapter number 6 here in Matthew chapter number 8

41
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,660
It says that he marveled and said unto them that followed

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,699
Verily I say unto you notice where he said I

43
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,539
Have not found

44
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,539
so great faith

45
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,020
No

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,580
Not in Israel. Now, that's a good statement. Amen

47
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,020
I mean, that's a statement in which we see that the Lord Jesus Christ

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,740
he marveled when he heard these things and he says as response to that which he has heard to that which he's

49
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:27,500
Dealing with with the centurion. He says verily of a truth. I say unto you I have not found

50
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:33,699
I have found not excuse me. So great faith. No not in Israel

51
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:40,139
Matthew chapter number 8 we see that with the centurion look at the latter part of Matthew chapter number 8 not all the way at

52
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,179
the end but just skip down a couple of

53
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:46,619
Passages there and come to verse number 23 through 27. I won't read all of it

54
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,619
but in this particular passage of Scripture

55
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,660
we see that the disciples were instructed to get into a boat and

56
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,500
They were instructed to cross over and they encountered a great storm

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,220
And I want you to see what Jesus says to them in verse number 26 after they came to him waking him up saying Lord

58
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,100
Save us we perish. He says this in Matthew 8 in verse number 26. Why are you?

59
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,979
fearful oh

60
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,500
ye of

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,179
little faith

62
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:19,619
Why are you fearful? Oh ye of little faith in

63
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,619
Mark chapter number 4

64
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:25,619
The record is given from Mark's perspective

65
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,140
With regard to the same event and it's interesting for in Mark chapter number 4

66
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,779
The way in which Mark would record it is that he says here. Why are you so fearful?

67
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,779
How is it that you have?

68
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,299
no faith

69
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,299
How is it that you have?

70
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,779
no faith

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,459
In Matthew chapter number 15, I preached this passage of Scripture on Mother's Day this year and

72
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,019
this is a

73
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,339
Record that God gives us of the interaction that Jesus had with this distraught mother

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,619
And as we looked at this passage of Scripture

75
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:08,660
We made reference to that which Jesus said concerning her faith and it's recorded in Matthew 15 in verse number 28

76
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:13,739
Then Jesus answered and said unto her. Oh woman great is thy faith

77
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,739
Great is thy faith

78
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:21,420
And so in these few examples that we've seen we see of the centurion and we see of the distraught mother

79
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,619
That that the Lord Jesus Christ God in flesh is saying I have not found so great faith

80
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:32,380
No, not in Israel with regard to the centurion when he's referring to this distraught mother

81
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,619
He says great is thy faith to the disciples after they had seen many things and yet during the time of the storm

82
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:43,859
He says how is it that you have no faith? Oh ye of little faith

83
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:50,500
Reminds me of what the Lord said to Moses back in numbers chapter 14

84
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,739
You'll remember with me the record you don't need to turn there

85
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:58,140
but in numbers 13 God instructs Moses to send the spies and

86
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,480
We know we sing about 12 men went to spy on Canaan

87
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,380
Right the kids do the whole hand motions 10 were bad and two were good

88
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:12,260
And we know as we read that passage of Scripture that as you near the end of chapter number 13

89
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,019
they return from spying out the land and they bring that report and you enter into the 14th chapter and you see that Joshua and

90
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,220
Caleb are

91
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,940
Contending with the people because God is able

92
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,859
And yes, they they do not deny that they're fortified cities

93
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,299
They do not deny that there are giants in the land

94
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:35,660
But they say our God is greater our God has said that he will bring us into this land and they have a faith

95
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
full report

96
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,260
But in numbers chapter 14 in verse number 11

97
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,299
God is speaking to Moses and he says this the Lord said unto Moses

98
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,179
How long will this people provoke me and how long will it be air?

99
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
They believe me

100
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,059
For all the signs which I have showed

101
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,679
Among them, you know, God wants his people to believe him

102
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,700
Let me ask you this evening

103
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,779
Not only those that are here, but those that are watching on live stream this evening as we consider the subject matter

104
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Do you like it when people believe you?

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,140
You want to be trustworthy, right if you tell someone that you're gonna do it and they have to ask you

106
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,739
105 times if you're really gonna do it. Does that kind of annoy you I

107
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,459
Told you I was gonna do it right now

108
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:34,700
The reality is that sometimes we say that we're gonna do something and then we are hindered from doing it

109
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,380
Does it ever happen to you?

110
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,700
Maybe you have to send an email a text message a phone call and say hey listen

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,059
I know that I said I was gonna be there. I said I was gonna do this but something came up and I'm sorry

112
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:46,339
I can't be there. I can't do this. Whatever it might be

113
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:51,540
God is the name El Shaddai the Lord God Almighty

114
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,500
He he said is anything too hard for me?

115
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,380
He said that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think

116
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,399
There's never a time when God is not going to do what he said. He's gonna do

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,579
Amen, you believe that this evening. I believe that with all of my heart

118
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:15,380
That God is going to do what he said he was going to do

119
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,980
In fact, I believe that God has in a certain sense from a certain perspective

120
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,500
He has bound himself to do that which is recorded within his word

121
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,619
Amen

122
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,619
He's bound by his word

123
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,739
Luke says in Luke 18 in verse number 8

124
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,179
Nevertheless when the Son of Man cometh

125
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:44,380
Shall he find faith on the earth

126
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,659
Shall he find faith on the earth?

127
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:56,659
There's a truth that's in the Old Testament is repeated in the New Testament. The just shall live by

128
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,820
Faith right the just shall live by faith

129
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,619
What is faith?

130
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,619
Faith is taking God of his word

131
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,380
That's the the most simple definition. I could give you for faith is believing God

132
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:22,500
I believe that as we look at the scriptures and we see when God asked that question to to Moses when he said how long

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,179
Will it be e'er they believe me that they'll have faith that I will do what I said that I will do

134
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:35,219
It doesn't matter how big the the inhabitants of the land are it doesn't matter how fortified the cities are. I

135
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,099
Said I was gonna bring you into the land

136
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:45,979
And by the way, he says how long will it be e'er they believe me for all the signs which I have showed

137
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,739
among them

138
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,979
They had had the opportunity to see God do some mighty things

139
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,099
Had they not in Egypt land you read of the ten plagues

140
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,739
Not only did the children of Israel

141
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:06,599
Israel have the opportunity to see that, but we see that the very servants of

142
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:14,779
Pharaoh saw that and recognized and declared to Pharaoh, this is the finger

143
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:21,299
of God. They said to Pharaoh, how long? I mean, do you not see all the things that

144
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,939
are destroyed? I mean, how long are we going to endure this? I think about some

145
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:33,459
of the great passages of Scripture that we have. What a joy that God has given us

146
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:39,539
the complete word, the canon of Scripture, that we have the privilege of not only

147
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,019
reading these wonderful accounts, but then even in our lives we have the

148
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,619
opportunity to recognize how God has worked and what God has done on our

149
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:55,539
behalf and how he's proven over and over to be faithful, to be trustworthy, to be

150
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:02,459
dependable. And this evening, the question in Luke 18, when the Son of Man

151
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:09,579
cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? We're mindful of the verse of Scripture

152
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,059
that we often quote. In fact, here in just a few weeks in our study in the book of

153
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,179
Hebrews on Sunday morning, we'll enter into the 11th chapter, the hall of faith

154
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,699
chapter, as many have referred to it as. We'll read that wonderful verse of

155
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:28,139
Scripture in verse number 6, but without faith it is impossible to please him. For

156
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,059
he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them

157
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,499
that diligently seek him. So we think about this subject matter of faith and

158
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:45,339
unbelief. I preached a series actually several years ago on Sunday morning that

159
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:51,499
I entitled Increase Our Faith, and we looked at a number of passages of

160
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:55,179
Scripture throughout the Word of God that God could use in our lives as being

161
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,699
faith builders. The disciples say to the Lord in Luke 17 in verse number 5, they

162
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:06,899
say, Lord, increase our faith. And we studied for an entire year on Sunday

163
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,019
mornings various passages of Scripture on how we could have our faith increased,

164
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,219
and I often said this during that particular series, that if faith is a

165
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:20,659
flower, then doubt or unbelief is a weed. And if we want the flower to grow, we

166
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:28,459
got to deal with the weeds. Amen? I don't have a garden. We have some flower beds

167
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,579
here at church. In fact, Dean and his mom were here this afternoon pulling weeds.

168
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,939
And Mrs. Sparks mentioned to me that I wish the flowers at my house grew as

169
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:43,659
well as the weeds at church grow. How many of you have seen it to be so that

170
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:52,899
the weeds seem to grow very well? But if faith is a flower, then doubt or unbelief

171
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,739
is a weed and needs to be dealt with. Because what do the weeds do? They

172
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:05,219
choke out the flowers. Do they not? I read just last week about a Canadian thistle,

173
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:12,379
and they mentioned that just the depth at which the root system of this

174
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,659
thistle can go, not only the depth in which it can go, but how far out it can

175
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:25,339
spread. And in just an acre of property, if there's simply five of those thistle

176
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:33,299
plants, it can reduce the yield of that acre by nearly 25%. That's amazing. That's

177
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:38,699
how weeds work. So this evening we got to deal with the subject of unbelief. Back

178
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:43,179
in Mark chapter number 6 and verses 5 and 6, we see that the Bible says in

179
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:47,579
verse number 6, and he marveled because of their unbelief. I'll be honest with

180
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,619
you this evening, I like the passages where it says that he marveled at their

181
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:57,299
faith. Amen? I'd much rather it be that God is marveling at our faith and saying,

182
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:03,059
look at how great faith they have, rather than being in a situation where he's

183
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,859
marveling at our unbelief. This evening, number one, if you're taking notes, we

184
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:14,139
must learn to recognize unbelief. Learn to recognize it in your life. Listen,

185
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,139
you're never gonna confess it, you're never gonna deal with it, you're gonna

186
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,660
just ignore it if you're not learning how to recognize it. Have you ever

187
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,139
had a situation, again I don't have a garden, but if you're in a situation, there

188
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,819
are times, in fact, even with the flower beds here at church, that you'll go over

189
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:36,779
and you'll say, now is that a flower or a weed? Because maybe you're not sure. Is it a

190
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,019
flower or is it a weed? Right? We've been in that position, we've been in that

191
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:46,339
situation, we're not sure what this is. And when we look at the subject matter

192
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,139
of faith and unbelief, we need to learn how to recognize it. I marvel at what the,

193
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,940
just a few chapters later in Mark chapter 9, I think about this father that

194
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,259
is referenced here, and you see about the father and how he would be distraught

195
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:07,899
because of the the situation in which the son was faced with. And Jesus says to

196
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,779
him, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth, in verse

197
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,220
number 23 of Mark 9. And you know what that man cries out, the father of the

198
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:25,979
child cried out, Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief. So we need to learn how to

199
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:31,419
recognize unbelief. We need to learn how to recognize when I'm doubting, when I'm

200
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:37,619
not trusting, when I'm not exercising faith, when I'm not living by faith. I'm

201
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:45,179
not trusting God. I'm thinking somehow that God is not able to intervene in my

202
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,739
situation. Well you just don't know how bad it is for me, or you don't know how

203
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:54,220
this situation is. I recently was asked a question, I won't go into all the details

204
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,139
because it would take way too much time, but I was asked a question about

205
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,619
something that happened historically, not biblically, but something historically

206
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,940
that happened back in the 20th century. And there's a question that was posed

207
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,099
with regard to the behavior and whether it was right or wrong. And we began to

208
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:12,380
have interaction, one with another, as we were discussing the particular subject

209
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,739
matter. And I concluded this, that when we make decisions to manipulate the

210
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:24,619
situation, to intervene our own way, and to try to solve the problem ourselves,

211
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:31,459
that really we're limiting what God is able to do. We're limiting what God is

212
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:38,699
able to do. Because we say in unbelief, well I got to do this because this is

213
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:45,299
gonna happen if I don't do this. What about God? What is he able to do? I'm

214
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,819
thankful that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego didn't live that way. You know

215
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:53,459
why? We wouldn't have Daniel to read about that situation. I'm thankful that

216
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,899
Daniel didn't act that way. We wouldn't have, that's Daniel 3, then you look at

217
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,539
Daniel 6 and the den of lions. We wouldn't have it to read. We begin to look at

218
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,339
these various, aren't you thankful that David didn't act that way? He believed

219
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:12,419
God. He believed that God was able. He exercised faith. This evening we need to

220
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,539
learn how to recognize unbelief. This evening, I believe, number two, we need to

221
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:24,220
understand the results of unbelief. The results of unbelief. Notice what it said

222
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:34,220
in verse number five of Mark 6, and he could there do no mighty works. Matthew

223
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,979
records it this way in Matthew 13 and verse 58, and he did not many mighty

224
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:45,859
works there because of their unbelief. You know what the people missed out on?

225
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:51,739
They missed out on God working. They missed out on seeing what only God

226
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:57,459
could do. Now the passage tells us here in Mark 6 and verse number 5, save that

227
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:01,859
he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them. Now that's amazing to me.

228
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,739
That's almost as close as amazement as when Genesis 1 says, and he made the

229
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:11,660
stars also, right? Because it's no minor thing for him to heal some folks, but

230
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,819
what we understand by what Matthew and Mark both revealed to us in these

231
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:21,899
passages of Scripture with regard to what he was able to do is that there

232
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:30,859
was so much more that he could have done if they believed. If they believed. Right?

233
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:35,580
So what are the results of unbelief? You know what the results were? They missed

234
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,059
out on seeing God work. I don't want to miss out on seeing God work. I mean when

235
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,539
you read of some of the the Bible passages and you read of some of the

236
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:51,179
miraculous things, the mighty works that God has done, do you long to see God work

237
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,739
in that fashion? When you read of the things that God has done through church

238
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:03,659
history, we can read many accounts of folks that served God and lived for God

239
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:09,419
and lived by faith and faced just terrible situations and yet they trusted

240
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:17,580
God and God worked. God delivered. God blessed. And they could stand back and

241
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:25,580
they could say, look at what God did. Not look at how we managed the situation, but

242
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,020
look at what God did. I want to see God work. I won't ask you to show me your

243
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,899
hands if you're reading through the devotional book that we distributed

244
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:41,140
this year in 2020. Revival Today is the title of that book and it has a daily

245
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,140
devotion and it has a passage of scripture and then some type of

246
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,619
historical event that happened and many times as you read throughout those

247
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:56,979
accounts you read of miraculous things that God has done. Do you believe that

248
00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:00,539
God can still work in 2020?

249
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,139
I do.

250
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,259
His hand is not short.

251
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:06,619
He's not lost any of His power.

252
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,059
He is still the Lord God Almighty.

253
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,099
He still reigns. Amen?

254
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,579
The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.

255
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,659
That's what Revelation tells us.

256
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,619
Think about the results of unbelief

257
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,159
for the children of Israel in Numbers 14.

258
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,479
We read how that God said to Moses,

259
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,099
how long is it going to be ere they believe Me?

260
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,759
And then later in the passage in v. 23-24 of Numbers 14,

261
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,559
the Bible says,

262
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,599
"...surely they shall not see the land

263
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,199
which I swear unto their fathers,

264
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,879
neither shall any of them that provoked Me see it."

265
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,519
Wow.

266
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,759
What'd they do?

267
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,559
They wandered in the wilderness.

268
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,199
And they died.

269
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,679
Is that right?

270
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,319
That's what happened.

271
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,599
Is that a pretty high price to pay?

272
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,859
That's bad.

273
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,659
They didn't get to see what God had promised them.

274
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:08,259
I mean, they were on the edge of entering into the land.

275
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,979
In fact, those ten spies that did go into the land

276
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,339
and spy it out,

277
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,519
they never got to see it.

278
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,859
Never got to go and enter into it

279
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,859
with the nation of Israel.

280
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,059
Save Joshua and Caleb.

281
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,379
Joshua and Caleb.

282
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,599
I think about Joshua and Caleb often.

283
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,219
I think about how those 40 years must have been.

284
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,459
They were delayed from seeing what God had promised

285
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,519
because of the unbelief of the nation.

286
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:40,379
But I think that Joshua and Caleb kept their focus proper.

287
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,539
And they were yearning and longing

288
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,779
to get back to that land

289
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,979
to see how God would do it.

290
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:51,259
How's God going to give us this land?

291
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:52,459
What is He going to do?

292
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:55,099
We studied the book of Joshua this year.

293
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,879
It's amazing, is it not?

294
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,719
They got to see God work.

295
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:03,339
Understand this evening as we close tonight,

296
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:07,079
not only is it important that we learn to recognize unbelief,

297
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,719
not only should we understand the results of unbelief,

298
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,879
but finally this evening we need to understand the remedy

299
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,199
for unbelief.

300
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,839
The remedy.

301
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,279
Simple.

302
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,079
Romans 10.17

303
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,679
So then faith cometh by hearing,

304
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,479
and hearing by the Word of God.

305
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,699
I cannot overemphasize the importance of this book

306
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:35,179
in the life of every believer.

307
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,459
It's impossible for me to overemphasize

308
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:40,339
the importance of it.

309
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,699
Because the reality is that it's by this book

310
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:45,739
that God tells us that our faith is increased.

311
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,139
So then faith cometh by hearing,

312
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:52,039
and hearing by the Word of God.

313
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,499
As we study the Scriptures,

314
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,819
I wonder this evening,

315
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,459
when you face a difficulty,

316
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,059
when you face a trial in your life,

317
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,899
how many passages of Scripture

318
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:02,379
can God bring back to your memory

319
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:04,859
that increases your faith

320
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,659
because you've understood what God is able to do?

321
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,219
Because you've read it, you've studied it,

322
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,259
you've learned it,

323
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,619
you're aware of it,

324
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,899
you're interacting with it,

325
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:19,179
and God is increasing your faith.

326
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,219
There's a sad commentary in the book of Psalms

327
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,399
in the 78th chapter.

328
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:23,859
If you read Psalm 78,

329
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:24,799
you really have the opportunity,

330
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,719
we're not even gonna go there,

331
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,599
but you have the opportunity to read through

332
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,239
really a lot of the history of the nation of Israel.

333
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,559
It's really just an overview, obviously.

334
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,999
It is a lengthy psalm.

335
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,439
It's obviously not the longest psalm,

336
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,159
but it is a lengthy psalm.

337
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,559
And it quickly goes through several high points

338
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,399
of the history of the nation of Israel

339
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,639
and several things that are contained therein.

340
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,359
But you come to verse number 41

341
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,039
of that passage of Scripture,

342
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,999
and the Bible says this,

343
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:54,999
that they limited the Holy One of Israel.

344
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,379
I'm not sure if you can wrap your mind

345
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,579
around that this evening.

346
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,019
It's very challenging for me, actually,

347
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:07,019
to fully comprehend how you can limit a limitless God.

348
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,619
He's the Lord God omnipotent, is He not?

349
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,379
But you know how they limited Him?

350
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,339
Because they doubted.

351
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,699
Because of their unbelief.

352
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,159
And they limited the Holy One of Israel.

353
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,359
You can read other psalms,

354
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,159
and you can read other portions of Scripture,

355
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,959
and you can see how that God would share the truth

356
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,599
of how many things He was planning to do

357
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,979
or He was able to do for them,

358
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,439
but they would not believe Him.

359
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,919
They did not submit to them.

360
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,059
They did not trust in Him,

361
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,439
and therefore they did not,

362
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,859
as they would not hearken to His voice,

363
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:51,119
they did not see Him work in the way in which He could.

364
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,079
I won't read it, but reference in your notes perhaps

365
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,759
this evening Psalm 81.

366
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:00,279
And read what God says that He could do

367
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,679
for the nation of Israel for His people,

368
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,779
but they wouldn't hearken unto His voice.

369
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,999
It's amazing to me what God did for the nation of Judah

370
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:14,039
when the Assyrians were coming to attack.

371
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:20,019
We're aware of the way in which the Assyrians

372
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,299
took captive the nation of Israel,

373
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,259
the ten tribes of the north.

374
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,259
In fact, the Assyrians as the world power

375
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,459
at that particular time,

376
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:31,539
they had conquered many groups of people.

377
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:37,219
Sennachrab and Rabshakka,

378
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,539
they come to Judah.

379
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,219
And Hezekiah is the king.

380
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:49,939
Rabshakka says, don't trust Hezekiah.

381
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,199
He's telling you to trust God.

382
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,459
What about all these other people groups that we conquered?

383
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:57,299
And what about all of their gods?

384
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,399
There's something interesting that Hezekiah recognized.

385
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,019
They were all idols.

386
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,339
But Hezekiah and the nation of Judah

387
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:09,759
served the Lord God, Jehovah.

388
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,219
You know what Hezekiah did?

389
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:17,099
He took those letters and he laid them out before God.

390
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,419
And he prayed.

391
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,519
Isaiah is the prophet at the time

392
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,559
if you look historically and you can go back and forth.

393
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,839
In fact, you can read it in Isaiah as well,

394
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,919
how that Isaiah brings a message back to him.

395
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,799
He says, don't be afraid of them.

396
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,899
God's gonna deal with them.

397
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,719
You know, God dealt with them.

398
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,739
They didn't even have to,

399
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,079
they didn't have to raise a sword.

400
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,079
God dealt with them.

401
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,959
You say that was then.

402
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,139
I'm the Lord, I change not.

403
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,019
Our God is able.

404
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,859
I understand that He's able to do exceeding abundantly

405
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,179
above all that we ask or think.

406
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:51,419
I believe that.

407
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,699
Paul prays that.

408
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:55,499
In fact, I'm mindful of what James says

409
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,539
in James chapter number five,

410
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,259
when he says that the effectual fervent prayer

411
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,899
of a righteous man availeth much.

412
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,739
And then he uses the example of Elijah praying.

413
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,019
And he says that he's like passion.

414
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,099
Elijah was a man like we're men, human beings.

415
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,119
And yet he prayed and it did not rain

416
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,359
for the space of three and a half years, right?

417
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,399
You read it, 1 Kings 17.

418
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:18,919
And then he prayed again and guess what?

419
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:19,759
It rained.

420
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:27,139
And James, near the end of the New Testament canon,

421
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,519
says to us as New Testament believers

422
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,039
that the effectual fervent prayer

423
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,539
of a righteous man availeth much.

424
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,039
You know what praying is?

425
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,219
Exercising faith.

426
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,079
Inviting God to work in the circumstances of our lives.

427
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,399
Recognizing our own inabilities

428
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:48,079
and not seeking to scheme and plan and devise

429
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,279
and figure out how we're gonna do it.

430
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,399
No, God, we're trusting you.

431
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,639
We know that you're able.

432
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,059
We know that you're sovereign.

433
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,759
The Bible says that he marveled because of their unbelief.

434
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,639
He marveled because of their unbelief.

435
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:08,019
Yet we read of the centurion.

436
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,479
He marveled and said,

437
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:14,019
verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith,

438
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,339
no, not in Israel.

439
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,339
What'd that centurion say?

440
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:21,499
He said, Jesus, you don't even have to come

441
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,799
to my house to heal.

442
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,059
Because I know the power that I have.

443
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,939
I say do this and do that and they do it.

444
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,459
And I recognize that you're God

445
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,739
and so you don't even have to come to my house and heal.

446
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,299
It distances no matter for you.

447
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,559
You read it in Matthew 8.

448
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,639
That's what he deals with.

449
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,679
We serve a great God.

450
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,019
I wanna read to you this wonderful hymn.

451
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You're familiar with it.

452
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,399
Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.

453
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,759
The songwriter said, tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.

454
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,759
Notice this, just to take him at his word.

455
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:05,139
Just to rest upon his promise.

456
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:08,619
Just to know, thus saith the Lord.

457
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:12,859
Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus.

458
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,699
Just to trust his cleansing blood.

459
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:19,299
Just in simple faith to plunge me

460
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,979
neath the healing, cleansing flood.

461
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:25,619
Yes, tis sweet to trust in Jesus.

462
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:28,519
Just from sin and self to cease.

463
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:31,820
Just from Jesus simply taking life

464
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,139
and rest and joy and peace.

465
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:40,739
I'm so glad I learned to trust thee.

466
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:44,820
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend.

467
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,539
And I know that thou art with me,

468
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,419
wilt be with me to the end.

469
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,859
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him.

470
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,659
Notice this, how I've proved him.

471
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:15,819
or and or. Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus, oh for grace to trust Him more. This

472
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:20,819
evening, I'm sure that many of us that are gathered, in fact many that are

473
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,339
watching via live stream, have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

474
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:31,939
Savior. We're trusting Him for eternity, but for some reason we have such

475
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:40,699
difficulty trusting Him for tomorrow. Isn't it true? Honestly, I believe God's

476
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:48,939
trying to help somebody. I believe He's helped me. He wants to help us to trust

477
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:54,499
Him. Oh for grace to trust Him more. That's the last tagline of that chorus,

478
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,059
but I think about what it says in the beginning there, or at the end of that

479
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:05,139
last verse, how I've proved Him or and or. You know what God says in Malachi? He

480
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:12,419
says, prove me, prove me, and see if I won't do this. Go and read it, Malachi.

481
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:19,979
God says, prove me. What's He saying? I'll do what I said I will do, but see for us

482
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:24,579
as God's people, we need to learn to trust Him. We deal with this situation of

483
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:31,579
unbelief. We do, all of us do. We need to learn how to recognize it. We need to

484
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:34,619
understand what the results of it are, and then we need to understand what the

485
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:42,859
remedy is. The remedy is getting into this book. Oh God, increase my faith. I

486
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,179
believe that you said faith cometh by hearing and hearing by your Word, and so

487
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:50,579
I want to sit under the sound of the preaching the Word of God. I want to get

488
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:55,339
into the Word of God every day of my life, because I want my faith to be

489
00:31:55,339 --> 00:32:01,779
increased. Because without faith, it's impossible to please Him. Remember, the

490
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:09,179
just shall live by faith. If Jesus were to come to your house, if Jesus were to

491
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:17,099
come to our church, would He marvel because of our unbelief, or would He

492
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:25,419
marvel because we have great faith? Would He marvel because of our unbelief, or

493
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:30,059
would He marvel because of our great faith? I hope this evening that you want

494
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,499
to see God work, and that you believe that He still can. He's still on His

495
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:44,379
throne. Amen? Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you so much for loving us.

496
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:54,699
Thank you for your Word. Thank you for how your Word convicts us, challenges us,

497
00:32:54,739 --> 00:33:02,859
changes us, comforts us. We understand this evening that you've said that your

498
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:11,659
Word is profitable. God, I believe that you desire to help your people through

499
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:19,899
your Word. Fathers, we have had the opportunity this evening to examine

500
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:24,219
several interactions that our Lord and Savior had with people when He walked

501
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:30,859
upon this earth, and statements that He made with regard to their faith. I pray

502
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:38,619
tonight that we've been challenged, and that we've been helped. God, I pray that

503
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:45,179
you'd help us to be a people that trust you. Help us to be a people that live by

504
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:59,339
faith. Help us to run to your Word, dig in, feast upon. It's not going to work to

505
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:06,299
just have a little verse here and there. You need to feast upon the Word of God

506
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,419
so that our faith would be increased. I pray, God, that you would help us as we

507
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,219
enter into our prayer time. We thank you for the privilege of prayer. We pray that

508
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,339
you'd work mightily. God, that we'd have the opportunity to see you do what only

509
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:29,579
you can do, that you alone would be glorified. Well, thank you for the work

510
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,939
that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen. I invite you to take your

511
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,179
prayer bulletin this evening.
