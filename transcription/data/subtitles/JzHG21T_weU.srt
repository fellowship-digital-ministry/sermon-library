1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,159
And as you're turning to the book of 1 Thessalonians,

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:07,440
you'll be mindful that the Lord allowed the Apostle Paul

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,920
and his team to travel to the city of Thessalonica.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,899
It was during the second missionary journey

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:16,959
in which God allowed them to go to this particular city.

6
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,879
And we find that as they arrived to the city,

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,559
we find the work that was done.

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,219
And if you were to read Acts chapter number 17,

9
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,579
you'll have an opportunity to read the record

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,139
that God gives us of their entrance into that city

11
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,060
and their preaching of the gospel.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,580
And we understand that as we read the passage

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,939
in Acts chapter number 17,

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,459
that the time that they were able to spend

15
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,220
in the city of Thessalonica was brief.

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,779
It was cut short from a human's perspective, if you will,

17
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:46,619
due to the opposition to the gospel.

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,900
We understand that on this second missionary journey,

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,139
there were some that even as Paul and his team

20
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,380
arrived in Thessalonica,

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,439
there were some from other cities

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,919
that did not like the message

23
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,779
in which they were preaching that would come

24
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,759
and cause problems for Paul and his team

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,279
there in the city of Thessalonica.

26
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,339
And we know that every time you attempt

27
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:09,120
to do a work for God, there will be opposition.

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,580
And they face that opposition,

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,139
but it's interesting and exciting to understand

30
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,440
that just after a brief period of time

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,919
in the city of Thessalonica,

32
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,879
that a church was established.

33
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,040
And we find that that church was established.

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
And as you examine the communication

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,279
that God allows Paul to give to this church

36
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,620
that's part of the canon of scripture,

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,360
we understand all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,019
As you study 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

39
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,760
and really in particular as our focus today

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,379
will be on the book of 1 Thessalonians,

41
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,599
you have the opportunity to really see

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,519
the way in which Paul and the believers in this church

43
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,319
had a close relationship.

44
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,400
God allowed them to have a bind,

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,519
one with another to have this just tight relationship.

46
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,000
And we find that as we look at the book of 1 Thessalonians,

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,319
I'm mindful this morning, and you know as well

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,959
that this book is written to a local church.

49
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,160
It's written to a body of believers.

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
And it is written from,

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,360
understood under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,479
but it is written from a church leader,

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,160
from the Apostle Paul.

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,720
And we find that as Paul is writing this,

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,619
and he would reveal to us through various means

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,139
the relationship that they held.

57
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,820
I'd like to use an expression that he uses

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,059
in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 11 this morning,

59
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:33,899
and really will serve as our title.

60
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,960
Look there at 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 11.

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,100
The Bible says, as ye know,

62
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,580
how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you,

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,539
then notice this phrase,

64
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,660
as a father doth his children.

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,179
As a father doth his children.

66
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,259
As we look at that phrase and understand that again,

67
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,979
as I mentioned during our announcement time this morning,

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,220
that we'll have a part one this morning,

69
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,899
and a part two this evening,

70
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:05,300
having the same title,

71
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,899
as a father doth his children, part one and part two.

72
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,940
As we begin to look at this short book,

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,520
we will find, and I know there's a lot more

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,160
than what we'll look at today,

75
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,720
but for sake of getting through it in one day,

76
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,160
and two messages,

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,639
I'd like to examine five principles

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,119
that I believe if we would implement these five principles,

79
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:31,100
that it will lead us to reaching the ultimate goal

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,080
that is noted in verse number 12 of the same chapter.

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
Paul says at the end of verse number 11,

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,179
as a father doth his children,

83
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:42,860
then notice what the ultimate goal is,

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,600
that ye would walk worthy of God,

85
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,600
who hath called you unto His kingdom and glory.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,520
You understand that children are not going to

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,199
just by chance walk worthy of God?

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,759
New believers are not going to, by chance,

89
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,000
walk worthy of God.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,399
And as we examine the passage of Scripture

91
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,960
both this morning and this evening,

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,500
and really we're gonna look at the entire book,

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,839
and kinda just look at a variety of verses

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
throughout the book of 1 Thessalonians,

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
take an overview if you will.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,040
As we look at this book

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,799
and think of this truth this morning,

98
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,799
I want us to look at it from two perspectives.

99
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,380
Number one, from a father to a child.

100
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,320
That parental relationship,

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,239
we don't know and we find here that Paul,

102
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,000
as he would use this expression,

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
as a father doth his children,

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,839
he's not explicitly giving instruction

105
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,899
in the book of 1 Thessalonians to dads

106
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,100
on how they are to work and minister to their children.

107
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Though the Bible contains much information about parenting

108
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,739
and much truth is contained therein,

109
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,660
we find that Paul is writing to a church.

110
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,119
But he says in this same manner,

111
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,260
as a father doth his children,

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,619
this is how we were ministering.

113
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,959
What a great truth.

114
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,679
And I find that not only would we look at it this morning

115
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:13,059
from the perspective of a father to a child,

116
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,700
but I'd encourage you this morning

117
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,600
to look at it from a mature believer to a growing believer.

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,079
A mature believer to a growing believer.

119
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,899
You understand this morning that you may be here

120
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,459
and you say, I'm not a father, turn off the preacher.

121
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,320
No, no, no, no.

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,220
The word of God is applicable for all of us.

123
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,799
And we find that the principles

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,359
that we'll look at this morning,

125
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,260
as we would examine them from these two perspectives,

126
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,579
I believe it will help us.

127
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,279
And as we begin to look at the passage,

128
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,959
I just have two thoughts for you this morning,

129
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,019
and then we'll look at three thoughts this evening.

130
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,220
But if you're taking notes,

131
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,440
number one, first principle

132
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,820
that I believe we need to implement in our lives,

133
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,559
number one, impart biblical truth.

134
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,399
Impart biblical truth.

135
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,079
As Paul arrives into the city of Thessalonica,

136
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,559
as the word of God would give us the record of that

137
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,040
in Acts chapter number 17,

138
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,559
we find at the end of verse number two

139
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,959
that the Bible says this,

140
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,959
that he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

141
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,339
And the importance of imparting biblical truth,

142
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,980
oh, it's always been important,

143
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,700
but we find in the day and age in which we're living,

144
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,380
in the hour in which we're facing this morning,

145
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,299
oh, it is imperative that we, as the people of God,

146
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:30,859
would impart biblical truth.

147
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,559
It was not necessary for Paul

148
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,700
to enter into the city of Thessalonica

149
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,420
and share his own opinions.

150
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,320
It was not necessary for him to come there

151
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,519
and try to make them what he was.

152
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,519
No, he went there and he imparted biblical truth.

153
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,679
The book that we hold in our hands this morning

154
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,279
is the word of God.

155
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,980
It's a living book.

156
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,880
The Bible is quick and powerful

157
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
and sharper than any two-edged sword.

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
We understand this morning

159
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,540
that there are some that do not like the Bible.

160
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,100
There are some that would like to outlaw

161
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,559
the truth of God's Word

162
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,660
and to say that if you were to preach or teach

163
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,980
or even just share a truth from the Word of God

164
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,220
that it could be constituted as being hate speech.

165
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,940
But the Word of God is truth.

166
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,739
The Word of God is powerful.

167
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,779
And we must impart biblical truth.

168
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,339
Notice if you turn back to the book of Psalms,

169
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,700
and we're gonna look at a number of verses

170
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,940
and then make our way back to the book of 1 Thessalonians

171
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,700
and look at what Paul is doing

172
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,540
with these believers in Thessalonica

173
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,579
and be mindful of the truth that he says,

174
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,160
as a father doth his children,

175
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,559
practically speaking,

176
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,200
Psalm 19 as you're turning there,

177
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,720
practically speaking as Paul is ministering

178
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,760
to these believers in Thessalonica,

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,480
it is that second of the relationships that I mentioned

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
that we'd like to look at it from these perspectives.

181
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,600
It's a mature believer to a growing believer.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,119
We find this morning in Psalm 19

183
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,320
what a powerful passage of Scripture

184
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,119
beginning in verse number seven.

185
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
The Bible says this,

186
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,299
the law of the Lord is perfect.

187
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,899
Converting the soul,

188
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,440
the testimony of the Lord is sure,

189
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,059
making wise the simple.

190
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,339
The statutes of the Lord are right,

191
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,779
rejoicing the heart.

192
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,059
The commandment of the Lord is pure,

193
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:20,859
enlightening the eyes.

194
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,619
The fear of the Lord is clean,

195
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,260
enduring forever.

196
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,019
The judgments of the Lord are true

197
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,940
and righteous altogether.

198
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,260
Notice verse number 10,

199
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,280
more to be desired are they than gold,

200
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,799
yea, than much fine gold,

201
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,440
sweeter also than honey in the honeycomb.

202
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,599
I wonder this morning,

203
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,260
how do we value the Word of God?

204
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,640
Is it more precious to us than gold?

205
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,239
Yea, than much fine gold?

206
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,679
Notice in verse number 11 of the same passage,

207
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,500
the Bible says,

208
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,059
moreover, in addition to the truth

209
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,719
that's already been given,

210
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:03,479
moreover, by them, by the law of the Lord,

211
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,679
by the Word of God,

212
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,320
is thy servant warned.

213
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
And in keeping of them,

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,799
there is great reward.

215
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,840
Psalm 119, on two occasions,

216
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,520
and really, you can look at the entirety of Psalm 119

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
and see the value of the Word of God

218
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,479
and the importance of imparting biblical truth,

219
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:25,039
but I'll take just two verses from Psalm 119 this morning.

220
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,320
Verse number 72,

221
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,119
notice what the psalmist says here

222
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,820
in Psalm 119 in verse number 72.

223
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,179
The law of thy mouth is better unto me

224
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,859
than thousands of gold and silver.

225
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,940
I love the expression of the psalmist.

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,099
I mean, he understood the value of the law of the Lord,

227
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,940
of the truth that we have in our hands this morning.

228
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,840
Verse 127, the psalmist says here,

229
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,619
therefore, I love thy commandments above gold,

230
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,960
yea, above fine gold.

231
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,460
We have a society.

232
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,760
in which their value system is different than our value system or at least it

233
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,800
should be amen our value system should differ from the value system of the

234
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,720
world in which we live and we think about the preciousness of the Word of

235
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,840
God and we think about the importance of imparting biblical truth the reality

236
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,640
this morning is that we have the opportunity to impart truth to a future

237
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,780
generation as fathers to impart truth to your children as mature believers to

238
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,740
impart truth to growing believers and oh how important that we're engaged in this

239
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,300
work certainly there are people that buy gifts and we like to shower our children

240
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,340
with gifts and show them nice things and that's wonderful but if it's in place of

241
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,780
giving them the truth of this book it's not what we're supposed to be doing

242
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,700
impart biblical truth the the wise man Solomon notes in Proverbs 23 and verse

243
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:04,260
23 buy the truth and sell it not I mean get understanding get wisdom you see it

244
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,900
all throughout the book of Proverbs and oh how precious the Word of God is in

245
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,460
Proverbs chapter number 30 the Bible speaks about the Word of God being pure

246
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,340
oh I'm so thankful for the Word of God Jesus Christ before he went to the cross

247
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:27,380
of Calvary he said sanctify them through thy word thy word is truth John 17 and

248
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,780
verse 17 as we look back to the book of First Thessalonians I want you to notice

249
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,300
several references in this chapter in this book with regard to the Apostle

250
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,380
Paul's relationship in his imparting of biblical truth to these believers in

251
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,460
Thessalonica and as he would write back to them this first letter we understand

252
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,020
there's a second letter that we hold as well that we can read and study from but

253
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,540
I want you to notice how that the Apostle Paul when he's writing under the

254
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,580
inspiration of the Holy Spirit this first letter this epistle back to the

255
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,060
church the believers in Thessalonica that he is rehearsing for us how he

256
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,420
imparted biblical truth we understand that the record in Acts tells us that he

257
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,260
reasoned with them out of the scriptures but here in First Thessalonians in

258
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,180
chapter 1 look at verse number 5 the Bible says this for our gospel came not

259
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,180
unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much

260
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,740
assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you

261
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,660
became followers of us and of the Lord look at this having received the word in

262
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,700
much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost when he says that they received

263
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,100
the word will notice as we continue to go through this book that he's very

264
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,340
clearly referring to the Word of God to the scriptures to that which he had

265
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:57,420
imparted to them and he says that they received the word in much affliction but

266
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,100
with joy of the Holy Ghost see they were dealing with some trials and some

267
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,060
difficulties I mentioned already by way of introduction the way that those folks

268
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,220
came into the city of Thessalonica and they were not happy that Paul and others

269
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,100
were going and sending forth the Word of God in fact it's in that passage of

270
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,660
Scripture in which they make the accusation the charge that these that

271
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,660
have turned the world upside down have come hither also they were preaching the

272
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,700
Word of God they were imparting biblical truth in chapter 2 in verse number 2

273
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,700
notice the Bible says but even after that we had suffered before and were

274
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,220
shamefully entreated notice this as you know at Philippi we know what happened

275
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,860
at Philippi in Acts chapter 16 you can read of that and that's what happened

276
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,940
just before they come to Thessalonica Paul and Silas remember they were

277
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,660
imprisoned and God worked miraculously and they had suffered and they had been

278
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,300
entreated shamefully entreated but notice where he says in verse number 2

279
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:02,380
we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much

280
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,820
contention though they had suffered though they had been shamefully

281
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,340
entreated though they dealt with opposition and difficulty Paul was

282
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,540
absolutely 100% confident of the importance of the need of imparting

283
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,500
biblical truth and he said though this cost me though I suffered for this when

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,180
we came to this new city when we came to you in Thessalonica we were bold in our

285
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,780
God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention to give the Word of

286
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:43,900
God we find in verse number 9 look down of the same chapter it says for you

287
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:50,180
remember brethren our labor and travail for laboring night and day because we

288
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,660
would not be chargeable unto any of you notice we preached unto you the gospel

289
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,620
of God verse number 13 for this cause also thank we God without ceasing

290
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,180
because when you received the Word of God which he heard of us you received

291
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,140
it not as the Word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God which

292
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,900
effectually worketh also in you that believe what a great verse of Scripture

293
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,020
Paul says to these believers he said that we thank God without ceasing by the

294
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,020
way we ought to be thankful when people receive biblical truth yes we're

295
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,300
thankful for the opportunity to impart impart biblical truth but when somebody

296
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,900
receives that biblical truth we begin to see people be doers of the word and not

297
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,780
hearers only people that begin to implement the Word of God in their lives

298
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,420
how it should bring joy to our hearts how it should cause us to rejoice and

299
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,300
thank God he says here because when you receive the Word of God which he heard

300
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,700
of us see Paul understood that God was using him and others that were there on

301
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,700
that missionary journey to impart this biblical truth and God will use you to

302
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,140
impart biblical truth as well yes fathers to your children but what about

303
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,220
the mature believer to the growing believer and by the way wherever you are

304
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,540
in your walk with God there's someone that's not as far along in the journey

305
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,540
that you can invest in and you can impart truth in you know why some people

306
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,100
kind of get forgive me why some people kind of get cranky because they're not

307
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,060
doing anything they just kind of get cranky you ever meet somebody that's

308
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:41,220
cranky man we get to impart truth biblical truth listen you can find

309
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,460
somebody that's not as far along on the journey as you are the importance is

310
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,460
that you're on your journey and you're walking with God and you're making that

311
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,460
progress and you come alongside someone else and you invest in them and you

312
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,460
impart biblical truth Paul says that you received it listen I'm thankful that

313
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,540
they were bold to preach the Word of God I'm thankful that even though they faced

314
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,780
opposition they still went forth and imparted biblical truth the church at

315
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,900
Thessalonica we've often mentioned over the years and many Bible commentators

316
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,020
will make the same observation that this church in Thessalonica is not a perfect

317
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,820
church because there's no such thing as a perfect church but this church in

318
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,980
Thessalonica is a model church you can find a lot of things in this book first

319
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,740
Thessalonians even in second Thessalonians that show how this is a

320
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,660
model church and see Paul as we read here in verse number 13 he said you

321
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,020
received the Word of God which you heard of us he said you received it not as it

322
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:51,180
is not as the Word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God now notice the

323
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:58,100
last phrase which effectually worketh also in you that believe this morning

324
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,500
would you be able to testify that God's Word has worked in your life would you

325
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,540
be able to stand up and say listen let me tell you how God's Word has changed

326
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,500
me let me tell you how God's Word has helped me in fact perhaps you were

327
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,220
reading your Bible this morning I hope you were and as you're reading your

328
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,660
Bible this morning God was helping you as you're reading his Word and as you're

329
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,100
getting fed and you're nourishing on the truth of God's Word this past week if

330
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,060
someone were to come to you and I mean stand face-to-face with you and say to

331
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,780
you today hey what did God show you from his Word this week would you have an

332
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,300
answer see we don't do that a whole lot because we don't want to embarrass

333
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,619
people or we don't want to be embarrassed mark you're laughing it's

334
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,940
right though isn't it when's the last time somebody came up to you and said

335
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,860
hey what's God teaching you in his Word how's God working in your life this week

336
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:54,040
because his Word effectually worketh in you which also believe in this morning

337
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,900
if you can testify that God's Word has has worked in you and it's made a

338
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,980
difference in your life then guess what it will work in somebody else's life and

339
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,619
you can look at somebody else you say oh they don't want the Word of God just

340
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:11,820
look at them just whatever listen God's Word is powerful and we claim the

341
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,780
promise of the Word of God that it will work it effectually worketh also in you

342
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:26,500
that believe this morning impart biblical truth oh it's imperative we are

343
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,540
living today in a society that could be described as being biblically ignorant

344
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:43,179
but if we'd be honest you know who's responsible for that the church you know

345
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:50,220
why Paul said that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth impart

346
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:56,900
biblical truth it's a it's a it's a truth a principle that that spans time

347
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,300
it was truthful for Paul and for

348
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,980
He's a believer in Thessalonica, but it's important it's truthful for us today.

349
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,260
Impart biblical truth.

350
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,240
Notice chapter number four.

351
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,020
In chapter number four, we're going to see kind of some of the specifics of biblical

352
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,580
truth that Paul gave.

353
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:28,540
Sometimes we like to speak in generalities, and sometimes the Word of God gets real specific.

354
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,280
Further in chapter number four, notice what he says, furthermore then, we beseech you

355
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,160
brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought

356
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,700
to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.

357
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,120
When he speaks there in verse number one of you have received of us how you ought to walk

358
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,040
and to please God, he's speaking of the imparting of biblical truth.

359
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,120
They have received it.

360
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,940
The apostle Paul and his team, they went in there and they ministered and they served

361
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,020
and they gave the truth, and now he says, you have received of us how you ought to

362
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,220
walk and to please God.

363
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,160
And he says this, so you would abound more and more.

364
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,500
Notice this in verse number two.

365
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,220
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

366
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:22,200
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.

367
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,920
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,

368
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,360
not in the lust of concupiscence, even of the Gentiles which know not God, or even as

369
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,720
the Gentiles which know not God, that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner,

370
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,660
because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

371
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,640
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

372
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,600
Be therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us

373
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,200
his Holy Spirit.

374
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,320
Notice in verse number 11, and that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and

375
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,080
to work with your own hands as we commanded you.

376
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,440
Verse 12, that you walk honestly toward them that are without, that you may have lack of

377
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
nothing.

378
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,460
Skip over to chapter number 15, or chapter 5 if you will.

379
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,340
Look at verse number 15.

380
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,220
Actually look back up in verse number 14, this is now we exhort you brethren, warn them

381
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,060
that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men,

382
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,540
see that none render evil for evil unto any man, but even follow that which is good, both

383
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,580
among yourselves and to all men.

384
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,900
Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks, for this is the will

385
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,500
of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

386
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,180
Watch not the spirit, despise not prophesying, prove all things, hold fast that which is

387
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,380
good, abstain from all appearance of evil.

388
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,740
The very God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit, soul and

389
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,700
body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

390
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,860
He says, faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

391
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,220
Brethren, pray for us.

392
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,740
And all the brethren with an holy kiss, I charge you by the Lord that this epistle

393
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,900
be read unto all the holy brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

394
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,500
He got into some specifics, did he not?

395
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
We don't have time to develop all of it this morning.

396
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,620
But I want you to understand that he's imparting biblical truth.

397
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,460
He's saying, listen, God has given us the word and he's taught us how we're to live

398
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,640
and how we're to behave ourselves and what we're to do and what we're to avoid and he

399
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,240
gives them biblical truth.

400
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,840
And then he says this, in chapter number 5 and verse number 27, I charge you by the Lord

401
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,240
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

402
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Why?

403
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,280
Because we want to keep imparting biblical truth.

404
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,360
Does that make sense?

405
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,040
We just keep giving the Bible, just keep preaching the Bible, just keep teaching the Bible.

406
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,640
I was talking to a pastor friend not long ago, and as we were talking, we were just

407
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,880
discussing some of the different studies that we're doing and some of the different

408
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,960
teaching and preaching and going through books and various studies and so on and so forth.

409
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,240
And we were just chatting and the conversation came up.

410
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,320
And for those of you that maybe somebody's watching that's an evangelist, I don't know

411
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,200
why they'd be watching, but they would maybe take offense to this.

412
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,880
But the pastor said something to the effect about how evangelism preaching is different

413
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,840
than pastoral preaching.

414
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,520
And sometimes as a pastor, you preach a passage of scripture and then someone says, hey, four

415
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,320
years ago you preached that same text of scripture.

416
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,000
And they'll say something to that regard and so on and so forth.

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
And we were just chatting and having some good fellowship about it and talking about

418
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
different studies and what have you.

419
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,600
And here's what he said to me, and it was so profound, it's just a simple truth, but

420
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
it was impactful.

421
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,560
This man's been in the ministry for about 20 years longer than I've been in the ministry.

422
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
And he said this.

423
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,640
He said, when that happens in my ministry, I always just simply think this thought.

424
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,400
When everyone sitting in the congregation obeys everything that I've preached, then

425
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll stop preaching it.

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
And I said, you know what?

427
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
That's pretty good.

428
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
It's pretty good.

429
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,480
Because we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

430
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Amen?

431
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,160
Listen, we never stop imparting biblical truth.

432
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,880
We got to keep giving it and keep giving it and keep giving it.

433
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,800
Not only as fathers to our children, but as mature believers to growing believers.

434
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
You say, well, I'm not a mature believer.

435
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,640
Well, you're a growing believer somewhere further down the road than someone else.

436
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,240
Amen?

437
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,640
Number two this morning, not only do we impart biblical truth, but number two, we model biblical

438
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,920
truth.

439
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,360
We model biblical truth.

440
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,080
Someone said, the message of your life has a far greater impact than the message of your

441
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,920
lips.

442
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:09,000
The message of your life has a far greater impact than the message of your lips.

443
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,040
I would say this this morning, that it's absolutely necessary that the message of our lips be

444
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,960
modeled in our lives.

445
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,280
That as we would impart biblical truth, that we also are living biblical truth.

446
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,920
That we're modeling that truth that we're teaching, that we're giving.

447
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,760
It's interesting, Paul says this in Romans chapter number two, as he's really giving

448
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,160
an indictment against the Jews in this passage of scripture.

449
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,680
He says this in verse number 21 of Romans chapter number two.

450
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,400
He says, what a great series of questions.

451
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,600
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest not thyself.

452
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,760
It's a good question, is it not?

453
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:02,080
Thou therefore, Romans 2 verse 21, which teachest another, teachest not thyself.

454
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,400
Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

455
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,200
That would be hypocritical, would it not?

456
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Listen, don't steal, and then you're stealing.

457
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Hypocrisy.

458
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Verse 22, thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?

459
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

460
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,080
And so just in these two verses of scripture, he's giving a series of questions, and basically

461
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,040
what he's telling us as we study here and look at these verses of scripture, listen,

462
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,120
the message that we preach, the truth that we impart, we ought to be living that.

463
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,480
We ought to be modeling that.

464
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,440
How often we've heard people give testimony of someone that gave them some instruction,

465
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,200
and as they were giving the instruction, were violating the same instruction that they were

466
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
giving.

467
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,400
How impactful do you think that instruction is?

468
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,520
Don't do this while I'm doing it.

469
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,120
How far do you think that's going to go?

470
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,160
Not very far, right?

471
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,160
And so we find that it is imperative that we impart biblical truth, but it's just as

472
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,080
imperative that we model biblical truth.

473
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,320
Notice here in the book of 1 Thessalonians, as we've mentioned that we're going to kind

474
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,360
of take a survey here through this book, we looked at chapter 1 and verse number 5 earlier,

475
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,280
but look at it again with me.

476
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,800
In 1 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 5, Paul was faithful to impart biblical truth, but

477
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,280
we find also that he was faithful to model biblical truth.

478
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,080
It reminds me of the principle in Proverbs 23 and 26 when it says, my son, give me thine

479
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,000
heart and let thine eyes observe my ways.

480
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,440
I wonder this morning how many of us could really say to somebody, watch my life and

481
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,080
just do what I do.

482
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,640
Not in a prideful, arrogant way, but in a manner in which, listen, as best as we are

483
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,360
able, through the power of the Holy Spirit, through yielding to him, through walking in

484
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,920
the Spirit, not fulfilling the lust of the flesh, that we could say to somebody, just

485
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,000
model my behavior.

486
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,440
Paul said to the believers in Corinth, be followers of me, even also as I am of Christ.

487
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,800
Paul was following the Lord Jesus Christ.

488
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Was he perfect?

489
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
No.

490
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,720
But he says, the things that you see in me do.

491
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,040
He's modeling biblical truth.

492
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,960
Notice in verse number 5 of 1 Thessalonians 1, it says this, for our gospel came not unto

493
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,000
you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance.

494
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Notice this phrase, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

495
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,120
Listen, these people in Thessalonica, they saw Paul and the others.

496
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,760
They observed what they were doing and how they were living.

497
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,360
And as we look at the truth of this brief time that Paul was able to minister among

498
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,660
these believers, not only was he imparting biblical truth, but he was

499
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,480
modeling biblical truth. And you think about the impact of the ministry

500
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,580
in Thessalonica and why, roughly, it appears as you read Acts 17, three weeks,

501
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,340
it was three Sabbath days that they reasoned together with them. How in the

502
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,820
world could a church be established and all of these things be done, and writing

503
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,900
back to these believers and encouraging them, instructing them,

504
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,740
because it was a message that was not lips only, it was a message that was

505
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:44,460
modeled by the life as well. Great impact. When you look at the testimony of the

506
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,580
Apostle Paul, you see a man that would go forth and boldly preach the Word of God,

507
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,620
but he lived the Word of God. Here in chapter number two, look down at

508
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,180
1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 7, the Bible says this,

509
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:06,620
but we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. Again, he's

510
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,500
saying to these believers in Thessalonica, listen, you know how we

511
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,700
behaved ourselves, you know how we acted, you know what we did. The reality is that

512
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,020
in chapter number three, he talks about, you remember. Listen, he's writing to

513
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,460
people that he ministered to. He can't pull the wool over their eyes. He's saying

514
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,580
to them, you know how we behaved ourselves, you know how we were gentle among you, even

515
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,660
as a nurse cherisheth her children. Look down, if you will, at verse number 10 of

516
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:42,140
1 Thessalonians 2, verse number 10. He says, ye are witnesses, and God also. Wow,

517
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:48,020
that is a weighty statement. Ye, believers in Thessalonica, that's who he's

518
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,340
writing to, right? Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus under the church of the

519
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:59,220
Thessalonians, verse number 1 of chapter 1. He says, ye are witnesses, and God also.

520
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:08,620
How wholly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe.

521
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:15,540
Wow, what a great testimony. It's on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, right? The

522
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:23,140
Word of God. And Paul says, listen, ye are witnesses, God also. God knows all things.

523
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,420
God sees all things. He says, and you understand what our behavior was. You understand how

524
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,100
we behaved ourselves among you that believe. He says, as the words that would be used to

525
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:44,500
describe their behavior, wholly, just, and unblameable. Wow. That's a fantastic testimony.

526
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,260
He says, not only did we impart biblical truth, but we modeled biblical truth. We didn't

527
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,300
just tell you to not do these things or to do these things, but we lived the Word of

528
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,820
God. We find here in verse number 11, he says, as ye know, we've used this as our title

529
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,460
this morning, the last phrase, but notice the phrase again. He says in verse 10, ye

530
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:13,600
are witnesses. He says in verse number 11, as ye know, how we exhorted and comforted

531
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:24,640
and charged every one of you as a father doth his children. This morning, to the dads, do

532
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:33,080
your children see you model biblical truth? Do your children observe you living a life

533
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:43,200
pleasing to God, a life that matches the message of your lips? But to the mature believer,

534
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,720
I wonder are there some growing believers that look at your life and see, this is someone

535
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,800
that gets it. This is someone that's doing it, that they're obeying the Word of God.

536
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,480
They're living the Word of God. I wonder this morning if we could make some of these same

537
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,040
statements that Paul makes. See, as we begin to think about this truth this morning, these

538
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,640
two principles, if you will, that we impart biblical truth, that we model biblical truth,

539
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,800
and keeping in mind all the while what that goal is, the goal is that ye, those that you're

540
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,620
ministering to, would walk worthy of God. And in order for me to achieve that goal,

541
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,960
in order for me to see my children, in order for me to see some younger growing believers

542
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,640
walk worthy of God, I need to be imparting truth and I need to be modeling truth, biblical

543
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,440
truth. It's absolutely imperative. We notice the example of Paul. Of course, we're looking

544
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,080
at it here in the book of 1 Thessalonians. But I want to remind you, if you turn back

545
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,360
in your Bibles just a few pages to Philippians chapter number 4, I want to remind you what

546
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,560
Paul said to the believers in Philippi. Again, Philippi is the city that he was able to enter

547
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,360
into and minister amongst before he got to Thessalonica. And we can read of the record

548
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,480
of this ministry in Acts chapter number 16. And as Paul, under the inspiration of the

549
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,760
Holy Spirit of God, would write back to the church in Philippi, he gives them great instruction.

550
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,480
He's writing from prison. He's talking about rejoicing evermore. Rejoice in the Lord,

551
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,760
O Lord, and again I say rejoice. By the way, Paul was rejoicing, even in his circumstances,

552
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,280
in his difficulties. I wonder this morning, as you think about the message of the book

553
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,800
of Philippians, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice. I wonder this morning about that Philippian

554
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,640
jailer when the book of Philippians was written and he read it. And he was the one that had

555
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:53,560
put them fast in the prison. But he heard them sing praises unto God. The Philippian

556
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,440
jailer got saved. He said, what must I do to be saved? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

557
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Amen? And we find that that Philippian jailer was saved. But when Paul is saying rejoice

558
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,400
in everything, rejoice in the Lord, O way, I believe that that Philippian jailer, he

559
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,480
could say, you know, in the terrible circumstances that Paul was in, he was rejoicing. He's

560
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,320
writing from prison. He says in the first chapter, the things that happened to me have

561
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,840
happened for the furtherance of the gospel. He's rejoicing. But notice what he says in

562
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:38,080
verse number nine of Philippians 4. Those things which ye have both learned and received

563
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,920
and heard. Now those first three phrases of verse nine would be our first point this

564
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,320
morning, impart biblical truth. Ye have received it, you've learned it, you've received it,

565
00:36:51,320 --> 00:37:02,800
you've heard, but notice the last phrase, and seen in me do. The God of peace shall

566
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,280
be with you. Those things which I've imparted unto you, those things that you've learned,

567
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,880
you've received, and you've heard, but those things that I modeled, that you've seen in

568
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:23,440
me do. Have you ever been in a place where maybe you or maybe someone else that was in

569
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,200
your presence, your company, had a child that behaved in a certain manner that was embarrassing?

570
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,160
The parent, maybe you were in the situation, or maybe it was another parent, says, I don't

571
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,160
know where they learned that. You ever been in a situation like that? You say, well, if

572
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,520
I could be honest with you, I could probably help you understand where they learned that

573
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:50,680
from. Amen? Because you know what children do? They model the behavior they see. I'm

574
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,000
not saying 100% of the time, forever of their lives, but many times children model that

575
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,760
which they see. We impart Biblical truth, but we model Biblical truth. Listen, the example

576
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,320
of Paul is great, but we have a greater example, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 1 says

577
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,560
this of the Lord Jesus Christ. Notice what the Word of God says in Acts 1. We'll be finishing

578
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:25,520
here in just a moment with this truth of the example of our wonderful Savior. Luke is writing

579
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,840
here and the Bible says this in Acts 1, in verse number 1, the former treaties have I

580
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:45,520
made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began, notice what it says, both to do and teach.

581
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,520
This morning we acknowledge and understand that Jesus is the master teacher. Many times

582
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,800
when we read the Gospel accounts, we don't even see all of what He was teaching, but

583
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,920
we'll maybe just read a phrase of He was preaching or He was teaching. He's the master teacher.

584
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,320
Nicodemus comes to Him by night. He says we know that thou art a teacher sent from God.

585
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,200
And we find that as we look at the truth that God gives us in His Word of the Gospel records

586
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:19,240
and we understand that these truths are given to us as the life and ministry of the Lord

587
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,200
Jesus Christ, that it was both to do and teach. It was imparting truth, but it was

588
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:32,920
also modeling truth. And Jesus says this, and of course we know that He is perfect and

589
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,680
that He is the perfect example. He says in John 8, in verse number 29, for I do always

590
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:51,560
those things that please Him. I do always those things that please Him. This morning

591
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:59,600
Jesus is our example. Peter says that Christ left us an example that we should follow His

592
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,560
steps.

593
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,720
And as we examine this morning, and we'll visit again this evening, the book of 1 Thessalonians,

594
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,200
with this thought in mind, as a father doth his children, and looking at it from really two

595
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:21,040
perspectives, from fathers to children, but then from a mature believer to a growing believer.

596
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,240
I'd ask you this question this morning in closing, or these two questions in closing this morning,

597
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,760
to whom are you imparting biblical truth? To whom are you imparting biblical truth?

598
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,920
If you don't have an answer for that question, I would encourage you to find someone to impart

599
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,040
biblical truth to. I would challenge you not to be satisfied with a no one answer,

600
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,320
because we ought to be imparting biblical truth. If you can't remember the last time that you've

601
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,680
had an opportunity to share biblical truth and impart it to someone, I would encourage you this

602
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:07,520
morning to ask God to help you to impart biblical truth. And then I wonder this morning, how are we

603
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:18,240
doing in the area of modeling biblical truth? How many people do we want to see observing our lives?

604
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:28,640
Can we say, as Paul said, that the things that you've seen in me do? I was teaching the teens

605
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:37,760
a couple of weeks ago, and I use really as a springboard verse of Scripture by which we'll

606
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:46,240
study throughout several weeks with the young people, this truth from 1 Samuel 16. And I won't

607
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,480
get into all of it, but Saul's dealing with an issue where he has an evil spirit that's troubling

608
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,440
him. And his counselors say, here's what we've got to do. We've got to find a man that can come in

609
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,320
and play, and man, this is going to be great. And they just go, okay, find him. And one of the

610
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,160
servants answered and said this in 1 Samuel 16, 18, just jot it down, and we can go back and read

611
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:20,240
it later. He says, behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, that is cunning and

612
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,840
playing, and a mighty, valiant man, a man of war, prudent in matters, a comely person, and the Lord

613
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,440
is with him. You know what I told the young people on Wednesday evening? Same thing I'm going to tell

614
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:40,240
you now. I'm not sure that David even knew who this servant was. I'm not sure that David knew

615
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,480
the servant was watching him, observing his behavior. You know what I told the young people?

616
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,320
When somebody says, I'm watching you, we can behave a certain way,

617
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,800
because we know somebody's watching us. I don't think David knew that this servant was watching

618
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:08,880
him. When they said, go find a man, and that servant says, I've seen, I've seen a son of Jesse,

619
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,840
a Bethlehemite, and here's how he describes him. Wow. People are watching you. People are watching

620
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:26,720
me. A lot of people watch me. Seriously. I'm being honest, man. I'm not saying that pridefully,

621
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,440
I'm just saying, with a position comes just certain things come along with it.

622
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,480
But you know, people are watching you. That person at work, that person in your neighborhood,

623
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,840
we need to find somebody to impart biblical truth to, but we need to make sure we're modeling

624
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,120
biblical truth. First two principles. Three more tonight. Come back tonight.

625
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,400
Challenge you to come back. I really believe this morning that as we look at this, just an overview

626
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,160
of First Thessalonians, there's a lot more. I had a lot more in my notes that I could give you

627
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,440
principle-wise, but five of them that I really believe will go far if we implement them in our

628
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:16,240
lives to being able to see some people walk worthy of God. You know why? It's not going to happen by

629
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,840
chance or by accident. We have the purpose to impart and then model biblical truth.

630
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,920
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you so much for the opportunity to gather

631
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:44,480
together, to honor fathers on this day, to rejoice in our relationship with you through the Lord

632
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:54,400
Jesus Christ. I'm challenged personally through the message of First Thessalonians,

633
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,840
the message from the perspective in which we've looked at it this morning.

634
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,920
God, I pray that we would not soon forget that which we've heard.

635
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,080
I pray that we'd truly allow the Holy Spirit of God to examine us. As we read in the end of First

636
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:19,760
Thessalonians 5, quench not the spirit. Grieve not the spirit, Paul says in another portion of

637
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,360
Scripture. Oh, God, I pray this morning that we'd be sensitive. We would not grieve nor quench

638
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,960
the Holy Spirit of God, but that we would be doers of the Word,

639
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,640
that we would understand the importance of imparting biblical truth.

640
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,120
If we're not imparting biblical truth, God, would you help us to recognize the need

641
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,760
and to engage in seeking earnestly to find someone that we can impart biblical truth to?

642
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,120
God, help us always to model biblical truth,

643
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,600
understanding that you see us at all times. There are many people that are observing us

644
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:16,000
and we don't even know. As a man of yesteryear said, sometimes the only Bible a lost man will

645
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,760
ever read is the life of a believer. How much truth, biblical truth are we modeling? Oh, God,

646
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:32,080
help us. Help us to do business with thee. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. We pray

647
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,640
that you'd be glorified through every decision, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

648
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,600
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around. Kimberly's going to play

649
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,640
quietly on the piano. Maybe this morning you want to come to this old-fashioned altar. Maybe you

650
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,640
want to ask God to help you to impart biblical truth. Maybe you need to ask God to help you to

651
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,760
model biblical truth. However it is that God may have worked in your heart and life this morning,

652
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:07,920
would you allow God to have his way? The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
