00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
And as you're turning to the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.440
you'll be mindful that the Lord allowed the Apostle Paul

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
and his team to travel to the city of Thessalonica.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.899
It was during the second missionary journey

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.959
in which God allowed them to go to this particular city.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:18.879
And we find that as they arrived to the city,

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.559
we find the work that was done.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.219
And if you were to read Acts chapter number 17,

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.579
you'll have an opportunity to read the record

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.139
that God gives us of their entrance into that city

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:32.060
and their preaching of the gospel.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.580
And we understand that as we read the passage

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.939
in Acts chapter number 17,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.459
that the time that they were able to spend

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.220
in the city of Thessalonica was brief.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.779
It was cut short from a human's perspective, if you will,

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:46.619
due to the opposition to the gospel.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.900
We understand that on this second missionary journey,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.139
there were some that even as Paul and his team

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.380
arrived in Thessalonica,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.439
there were some from other cities

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.919
that did not like the message

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:58.779
in which they were preaching that would come

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:01.759
and cause problems for Paul and his team

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.279
there in the city of Thessalonica.

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:06.339
And we know that every time you attempt

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:09.120
to do a work for God, there will be opposition.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.580
And they face that opposition,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.139
but it's interesting and exciting to understand

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:16.440
that just after a brief period of time

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.919
in the city of Thessalonica,

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:19.879
that a church was established.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.040
And we find that that church was established.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.000
And as you examine the communication

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.279
that God allows Paul to give to this church

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:28.620
that's part of the canon of scripture,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.360
we understand all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.019
As you study 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.760
and really in particular as our focus today

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.379
will be on the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:42.599
you have the opportunity to really see

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.519
the way in which Paul and the believers in this church

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.319
had a close relationship.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.400
God allowed them to have a bind,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.519
one with another to have this just tight relationship.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.000
And we find that as we look at the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.319
I'm mindful this morning, and you know as well

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.959
that this book is written to a local church.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.160
It's written to a body of believers.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.880
And it is written from,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.360
understood under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.479
but it is written from a church leader,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.160
from the Apostle Paul.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.720
And we find that as Paul is writing this,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.619
and he would reveal to us through various means

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.139
the relationship that they held.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.820
I'd like to use an expression that he uses

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.059
in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 11 this morning,

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.899
and really will serve as our title.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.960
Look there at 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 11.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.100
The Bible says, as ye know,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.580
how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.539
then notice this phrase,

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.660
as a father doth his children.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.179
As a father doth his children.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.259
As we look at that phrase and understand that again,

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.979
as I mentioned during our announcement time this morning,

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.220
that we'll have a part one this morning,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.899
and a part two this evening,

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.300
having the same title,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.899
as a father doth his children, part one and part two.

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.940
As we begin to look at this short book,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.520
we will find, and I know there's a lot more

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160
than what we'll look at today,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.720
but for sake of getting through it in one day,

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.160
and two messages,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.639
I'd like to examine five principles

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.119
that I believe if we would implement these five principles,

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.100
that it will lead us to reaching the ultimate goal

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.080
that is noted in verse number 12 of the same chapter.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.000
Paul says at the end of verse number 11,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.179
as a father doth his children,

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.860
then notice what the ultimate goal is,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.600
that ye would walk worthy of God,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.600
who hath called you unto His kingdom and glory.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.520
You understand that children are not going to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.199
just by chance walk worthy of God?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.759
New believers are not going to, by chance,

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.000
walk worthy of God.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.399
And as we examine the passage of Scripture

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:12.960
both this morning and this evening,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.500
and really we're gonna look at the entire book,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.839
and kinda just look at a variety of verses

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.320
throughout the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.000
take an overview if you will.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.040
As we look at this book

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.799
and think of this truth this morning,

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:26.799
I want us to look at it from two perspectives.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.380
Number one, from a father to a child.

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:32.320
That parental relationship,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.239
we don't know and we find here that Paul,

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:37.000
as he would use this expression,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.880
as a father doth his children,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.839
he's not explicitly giving instruction

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.899
in the book of 1 Thessalonians to dads

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:48.100
on how they are to work and minister to their children.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.140
Though the Bible contains much information about parenting

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.739
and much truth is contained therein,

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.660
we find that Paul is writing to a church.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.119
But he says in this same manner,

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:02.260
as a father doth his children,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.619
this is how we were ministering.

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.959
What a great truth.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.679
And I find that not only would we look at it this morning

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:13.059
from the perspective of a father to a child,

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.700
but I'd encourage you this morning

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.600
to look at it from a mature believer to a growing believer.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.079
A mature believer to a growing believer.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.899
You understand this morning that you may be here

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.459
and you say, I'm not a father, turn off the preacher.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:28.320
No, no, no, no.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.220
The word of God is applicable for all of us.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.799
And we find that the principles

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.359
that we'll look at this morning,

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:37.260
as we would examine them from these two perspectives,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.579
I believe it will help us.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:41.279
And as we begin to look at the passage,

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.959
I just have two thoughts for you this morning,

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.019
and then we'll look at three thoughts this evening.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:46.220
But if you're taking notes,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.440
number one, first principle

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.820
that I believe we need to implement in our lives,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.559
number one, impart biblical truth.

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.399
Impart biblical truth.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:01.079
As Paul arrives into the city of Thessalonica,

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.559
as the word of God would give us the record of that

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.040
in Acts chapter number 17,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.559
we find at the end of verse number two

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:07.959
that the Bible says this,

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:12.959
that he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.339
And the importance of imparting biblical truth,

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.980
oh, it's always been important,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.700
but we find in the day and age in which we're living,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.380
in the hour in which we're facing this morning,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.299
oh, it is imperative that we, as the people of God,

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.859
would impart biblical truth.

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:32.559
It was not necessary for Paul

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.700
to enter into the city of Thessalonica

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.420
and share his own opinions.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.320
It was not necessary for him to come there

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.519
and try to make them what he was.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:45.519
No, he went there and he imparted biblical truth.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.679
The book that we hold in our hands this morning

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.279
is the word of God.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.980
It's a living book.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.880
The Bible is quick and powerful

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.000
and sharper than any two-edged sword.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.160
We understand this morning

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.540
that there are some that do not like the Bible.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.100
There are some that would like to outlaw

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.559
the truth of God's Word

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:07.660
and to say that if you were to preach or teach

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.980
or even just share a truth from the Word of God

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.220
that it could be constituted as being hate speech.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.940
But the Word of God is truth.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.739
The Word of God is powerful.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.779
And we must impart biblical truth.

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.339
Notice if you turn back to the book of Psalms,

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:25.700
and we're gonna look at a number of verses

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.940
and then make our way back to the book of 1 Thessalonians

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.700
and look at what Paul is doing

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.540
with these believers in Thessalonica

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.579
and be mindful of the truth that he says,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.160
as a father doth his children,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.559
practically speaking,

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:39.200
Psalm 19 as you're turning there,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.720
practically speaking as Paul is ministering

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.760
to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.480
it is that second of the relationships that I mentioned

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.760
that we'd like to look at it from these perspectives.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.600
It's a mature believer to a growing believer.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.119
We find this morning in Psalm 19

00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:59.320
what a powerful passage of Scripture

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.119
beginning in verse number seven.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.140
The Bible says this,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.299
the law of the Lord is perfect.

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:07.899
Converting the soul,

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:10.440
the testimony of the Lord is sure,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.059
making wise the simple.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.339
The statutes of the Lord are right,

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:16.779
rejoicing the heart.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.059
The commandment of the Lord is pure,

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:20.859
enlightening the eyes.

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:22.619
The fear of the Lord is clean,

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:24.260
enduring forever.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.019
The judgments of the Lord are true

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:27.940
and righteous altogether.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.260
Notice verse number 10,

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:34.280
more to be desired are they than gold,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.799
yea, than much fine gold,

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.440
sweeter also than honey in the honeycomb.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.599
I wonder this morning,

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:44.260
how do we value the Word of God?

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:49.640
Is it more precious to us than gold?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.239
Yea, than much fine gold?

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:54.679
Notice in verse number 11 of the same passage,

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.500
the Bible says,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.059
moreover, in addition to the truth

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.719
that's already been given,

00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:03.479
moreover, by them, by the law of the Lord,

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:04.679
by the Word of God,

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:08.320
is thy servant warned.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.080
And in keeping of them,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.799
there is great reward.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:14.840
Psalm 119, on two occasions,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.520
and really, you can look at the entirety of Psalm 119

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.520
and see the value of the Word of God

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.479
and the importance of imparting biblical truth,

00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:25.039
but I'll take just two verses from Psalm 119 this morning.

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.320
Verse number 72,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.119
notice what the psalmist says here

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.820
in Psalm 119 in verse number 72.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.179
The law of thy mouth is better unto me

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:37.859
than thousands of gold and silver.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:40.940
I love the expression of the psalmist.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.099
I mean, he understood the value of the law of the Lord,

00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:46.940
of the truth that we have in our hands this morning.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.840
Verse 127, the psalmist says here,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.619
therefore, I love thy commandments above gold,

00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:55.960
yea, above fine gold.

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.460
We have a society.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.760
in which their value system is different than our value system or at least it

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.800
should be amen our value system should differ from the value system of the

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.720
world in which we live and we think about the preciousness of the Word of

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.840
God and we think about the importance of imparting biblical truth the reality

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.640
this morning is that we have the opportunity to impart truth to a future

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.780
generation as fathers to impart truth to your children as mature believers to

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:34.740
impart truth to growing believers and oh how important that we're engaged in this

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.300
work certainly there are people that buy gifts and we like to shower our children

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.340
with gifts and show them nice things and that's wonderful but if it's in place of

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.780
giving them the truth of this book it's not what we're supposed to be doing

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:57.700
impart biblical truth the the wise man Solomon notes in Proverbs 23 and verse

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:04.260
23 buy the truth and sell it not I mean get understanding get wisdom you see it

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.900
all throughout the book of Proverbs and oh how precious the Word of God is in

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.460
Proverbs chapter number 30 the Bible speaks about the Word of God being pure

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:19.340
oh I'm so thankful for the Word of God Jesus Christ before he went to the cross

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:27.380
of Calvary he said sanctify them through thy word thy word is truth John 17 and

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.780
verse 17 as we look back to the book of First Thessalonians I want you to notice

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.300
several references in this chapter in this book with regard to the Apostle

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.380
Paul's relationship in his imparting of biblical truth to these believers in

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.460
Thessalonica and as he would write back to them this first letter we understand

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.020
there's a second letter that we hold as well that we can read and study from but

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.540
I want you to notice how that the Apostle Paul when he's writing under the

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.580
inspiration of the Holy Spirit this first letter this epistle back to the

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.060
church the believers in Thessalonica that he is rehearsing for us how he

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.420
imparted biblical truth we understand that the record in Acts tells us that he

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.260
reasoned with them out of the scriptures but here in First Thessalonians in

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.180
chapter 1 look at verse number 5 the Bible says this for our gospel came not

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.180
unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.740
assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:36.660
became followers of us and of the Lord look at this having received the word in

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.700
much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost when he says that they received

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.100
the word will notice as we continue to go through this book that he's very

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.340
clearly referring to the Word of God to the scriptures to that which he had

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.420
imparted to them and he says that they received the word in much affliction but

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.100
with joy of the Holy Ghost see they were dealing with some trials and some

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.060
difficulties I mentioned already by way of introduction the way that those folks

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.220
came into the city of Thessalonica and they were not happy that Paul and others

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.100
were going and sending forth the Word of God in fact it's in that passage of

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.660
Scripture in which they make the accusation the charge that these that

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.660
have turned the world upside down have come hither also they were preaching the

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:29.700
Word of God they were imparting biblical truth in chapter 2 in verse number 2

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.700
notice the Bible says but even after that we had suffered before and were

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.220
shamefully entreated notice this as you know at Philippi we know what happened

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.860
at Philippi in Acts chapter 16 you can read of that and that's what happened

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.940
just before they come to Thessalonica Paul and Silas remember they were

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.660
imprisoned and God worked miraculously and they had suffered and they had been

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.300
entreated shamefully entreated but notice where he says in verse number 2

00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:02.380
we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.820
contention though they had suffered though they had been shamefully

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.340
entreated though they dealt with opposition and difficulty Paul was

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.540
absolutely 100% confident of the importance of the need of imparting

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.500
biblical truth and he said though this cost me though I suffered for this when

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.180
we came to this new city when we came to you in Thessalonica we were bold in our

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:36.780
God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention to give the Word of

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:43.900
God we find in verse number 9 look down of the same chapter it says for you

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:50.180
remember brethren our labor and travail for laboring night and day because we

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.660
would not be chargeable unto any of you notice we preached unto you the gospel

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:02.620
of God verse number 13 for this cause also thank we God without ceasing

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.180
because when you received the Word of God which he heard of us you received

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:14.140
it not as the Word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God which

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:19.900
effectually worketh also in you that believe what a great verse of Scripture

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.020
Paul says to these believers he said that we thank God without ceasing by the

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.020
way we ought to be thankful when people receive biblical truth yes we're

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.300
thankful for the opportunity to impart impart biblical truth but when somebody

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.900
receives that biblical truth we begin to see people be doers of the word and not

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.780
hearers only people that begin to implement the Word of God in their lives

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.420
how it should bring joy to our hearts how it should cause us to rejoice and

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:53.300
thank God he says here because when you receive the Word of God which he heard

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.700
of us see Paul understood that God was using him and others that were there on

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.700
that missionary journey to impart this biblical truth and God will use you to

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.140
impart biblical truth as well yes fathers to your children but what about

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.220
the mature believer to the growing believer and by the way wherever you are

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.540
in your walk with God there's someone that's not as far along in the journey

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540
that you can invest in and you can impart truth in you know why some people

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.100
kind of get forgive me why some people kind of get cranky because they're not

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.060
doing anything they just kind of get cranky you ever meet somebody that's

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:41.220
cranky man we get to impart truth biblical truth listen you can find

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.460
somebody that's not as far along on the journey as you are the importance is

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.460
that you're on your journey and you're walking with God and you're making that

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.460
progress and you come alongside someone else and you invest in them and you

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.460
impart biblical truth Paul says that you received it listen I'm thankful that

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:04.540
they were bold to preach the Word of God I'm thankful that even though they faced

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.780
opposition they still went forth and imparted biblical truth the church at

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.900
Thessalonica we've often mentioned over the years and many Bible commentators

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:20.020
will make the same observation that this church in Thessalonica is not a perfect

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.820
church because there's no such thing as a perfect church but this church in

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.980
Thessalonica is a model church you can find a lot of things in this book first

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.740
Thessalonians even in second Thessalonians that show how this is a

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:37.660
model church and see Paul as we read here in verse number 13 he said you

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:43.020
received the Word of God which you heard of us he said you received it not as it

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:51.180
is not as the Word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God now notice the

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:58.100
last phrase which effectually worketh also in you that believe this morning

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:03.500
would you be able to testify that God's Word has worked in your life would you

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.540
be able to stand up and say listen let me tell you how God's Word has changed

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.500
me let me tell you how God's Word has helped me in fact perhaps you were

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.220
reading your Bible this morning I hope you were and as you're reading your

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.660
Bible this morning God was helping you as you're reading his Word and as you're

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.100
getting fed and you're nourishing on the truth of God's Word this past week if

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.060
someone were to come to you and I mean stand face-to-face with you and say to

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.780
you today hey what did God show you from his Word this week would you have an

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:35.300
answer see we don't do that a whole lot because we don't want to embarrass

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.619
people or we don't want to be embarrassed mark you're laughing it's

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.940
right though isn't it when's the last time somebody came up to you and said

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.860
hey what's God teaching you in his Word how's God working in your life this week

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:54.040
because his Word effectually worketh in you which also believe in this morning

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.900
if you can testify that God's Word has has worked in you and it's made a

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.980
difference in your life then guess what it will work in somebody else's life and

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.619
you can look at somebody else you say oh they don't want the Word of God just

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:11.820
look at them just whatever listen God's Word is powerful and we claim the

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.780
promise of the Word of God that it will work it effectually worketh also in you

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:26.500
that believe this morning impart biblical truth oh it's imperative we are

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:33.540
living today in a society that could be described as being biblically ignorant

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:43.179
but if we'd be honest you know who's responsible for that the church you know

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:50.220
why Paul said that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth impart

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:56.900
biblical truth it's a it's a it's a truth a principle that that spans time

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.300
it was truthful for Paul and for

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.980
He's a believer in Thessalonica, but it's important it's truthful for us today.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.260
Impart biblical truth.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.240
Notice chapter number four.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:18.020
In chapter number four, we're going to see kind of some of the specifics of biblical

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.580
truth that Paul gave.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:28.540
Sometimes we like to speak in generalities, and sometimes the Word of God gets real specific.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.280
Further in chapter number four, notice what he says, furthermore then, we beseech you

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.160
brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.700
to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.120
When he speaks there in verse number one of you have received of us how you ought to walk

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.040
and to please God, he's speaking of the imparting of biblical truth.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.120
They have received it.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.940
The apostle Paul and his team, they went in there and they ministered and they served

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:04.020
and they gave the truth, and now he says, you have received of us how you ought to

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.220
walk and to please God.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.160
And he says this, so you would abound more and more.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.500
Notice this in verse number two.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.220
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:22.200
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.920
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.360
not in the lust of concupiscence, even of the Gentiles which know not God, or even as

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:39.720
the Gentiles which know not God, that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.660
because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.640
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.600
Be therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.200
his Holy Spirit.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.320
Notice in verse number 11, and that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.080
to work with your own hands as we commanded you.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:13.440
Verse 12, that you walk honestly toward them that are without, that you may have lack of

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.440
nothing.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.460
Skip over to chapter number 15, or chapter 5 if you will.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.340
Look at verse number 15.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.220
Actually look back up in verse number 14, this is now we exhort you brethren, warn them

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:31.060
that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men,

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.540
see that none render evil for evil unto any man, but even follow that which is good, both

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.580
among yourselves and to all men.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.900
Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks, for this is the will

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.500
of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.180
Watch not the spirit, despise not prophesying, prove all things, hold fast that which is

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.380
good, abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.740
The very God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit, soul and

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:03.700
body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.860
He says, faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.220
Brethren, pray for us.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.740
And all the brethren with an holy kiss, I charge you by the Lord that this epistle

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.900
be read unto all the holy brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.500
He got into some specifics, did he not?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.500
We don't have time to develop all of it this morning.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.620
But I want you to understand that he's imparting biblical truth.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.460
He's saying, listen, God has given us the word and he's taught us how we're to live

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.640
and how we're to behave ourselves and what we're to do and what we're to avoid and he

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.240
gives them biblical truth.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.840
And then he says this, in chapter number 5 and verse number 27, I charge you by the Lord

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.240
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240
Why?

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.280
Because we want to keep imparting biblical truth.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.360
Does that make sense?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:01.040
We just keep giving the Bible, just keep preaching the Bible, just keep teaching the Bible.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.640
I was talking to a pastor friend not long ago, and as we were talking, we were just

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.880
discussing some of the different studies that we're doing and some of the different

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.960
teaching and preaching and going through books and various studies and so on and so forth.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.240
And we were just chatting and the conversation came up.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.320
And for those of you that maybe somebody's watching that's an evangelist, I don't know

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.200
why they'd be watching, but they would maybe take offense to this.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.880
But the pastor said something to the effect about how evangelism preaching is different

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.840
than pastoral preaching.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.520
And sometimes as a pastor, you preach a passage of scripture and then someone says, hey, four

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.320
years ago you preached that same text of scripture.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.000
And they'll say something to that regard and so on and so forth.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.240
And we were just chatting and having some good fellowship about it and talking about

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.000
different studies and what have you.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.600
And here's what he said to me, and it was so profound, it's just a simple truth, but

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600
it was impactful.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.560
This man's been in the ministry for about 20 years longer than I've been in the ministry.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560
And he said this.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.640
He said, when that happens in my ministry, I always just simply think this thought.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.400
When everyone sitting in the congregation obeys everything that I've preached, then

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400
I'll stop preaching it.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400
And I said, you know what?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400
That's pretty good.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400
It's pretty good.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.480
Because we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.480
Amen?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.160
Listen, we never stop imparting biblical truth.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.880
We got to keep giving it and keep giving it and keep giving it.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.800
Not only as fathers to our children, but as mature believers to growing believers.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.960
You say, well, I'm not a mature believer.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.640
Well, you're a growing believer somewhere further down the road than someone else.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.240
Amen?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:47.640
Number two this morning, not only do we impart biblical truth, but number two, we model biblical

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.920
truth.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.360
We model biblical truth.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:59.080
Someone said, the message of your life has a far greater impact than the message of your

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.920
lips.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:09.000
The message of your life has a far greater impact than the message of your lips.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.040
I would say this this morning, that it's absolutely necessary that the message of our lips be

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.960
modeled in our lives.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.280
That as we would impart biblical truth, that we also are living biblical truth.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.920
That we're modeling that truth that we're teaching, that we're giving.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.760
It's interesting, Paul says this in Romans chapter number two, as he's really giving

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.160
an indictment against the Jews in this passage of scripture.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.680
He says this in verse number 21 of Romans chapter number two.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.400
He says, what a great series of questions.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.600
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest not thyself.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.760
It's a good question, is it not?

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:02.080
Thou therefore, Romans 2 verse 21, which teachest another, teachest not thyself.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.400
Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.200
That would be hypocritical, would it not?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.400
Listen, don't steal, and then you're stealing.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.000
Hypocrisy.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.400
Verse 22, thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.400
Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.080
And so just in these two verses of scripture, he's giving a series of questions, and basically

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.040
what he's telling us as we study here and look at these verses of scripture, listen,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.120
the message that we preach, the truth that we impart, we ought to be living that.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.480
We ought to be modeling that.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.440
How often we've heard people give testimony of someone that gave them some instruction,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.200
and as they were giving the instruction, were violating the same instruction that they were

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.480
giving.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.400
How impactful do you think that instruction is?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.520
Don't do this while I'm doing it.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.120
How far do you think that's going to go?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.160
Not very far, right?

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.160
And so we find that it is imperative that we impart biblical truth, but it's just as

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.080
imperative that we model biblical truth.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.320
Notice here in the book of 1 Thessalonians, as we've mentioned that we're going to kind

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.360
of take a survey here through this book, we looked at chapter 1 and verse number 5 earlier,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.280
but look at it again with me.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:32.800
In 1 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 5, Paul was faithful to impart biblical truth, but

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:38.280
we find also that he was faithful to model biblical truth.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:43.080
It reminds me of the principle in Proverbs 23 and 26 when it says, my son, give me thine

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.000
heart and let thine eyes observe my ways.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.440
I wonder this morning how many of us could really say to somebody, watch my life and

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.080
just do what I do.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.640
Not in a prideful, arrogant way, but in a manner in which, listen, as best as we are

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.360
able, through the power of the Holy Spirit, through yielding to him, through walking in

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.920
the Spirit, not fulfilling the lust of the flesh, that we could say to somebody, just

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.000
model my behavior.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.440
Paul said to the believers in Corinth, be followers of me, even also as I am of Christ.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.800
Paul was following the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800
Was he perfect?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800
No.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.720
But he says, the things that you see in me do.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.040
He's modeling biblical truth.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.960
Notice in verse number 5 of 1 Thessalonians 1, it says this, for our gospel came not unto

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.000
you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.400
Notice this phrase, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.120
Listen, these people in Thessalonica, they saw Paul and the others.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.760
They observed what they were doing and how they were living.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.360
And as we look at the truth of this brief time that Paul was able to minister among

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.660
these believers, not only was he imparting biblical truth, but he was

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:11.480
modeling biblical truth. And you think about the impact of the ministry

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.580
in Thessalonica and why, roughly, it appears as you read Acts 17, three weeks,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.340
it was three Sabbath days that they reasoned together with them. How in the

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.820
world could a church be established and all of these things be done, and writing

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.900
back to these believers and encouraging them, instructing them,

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.740
because it was a message that was not lips only, it was a message that was

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:44.460
modeled by the life as well. Great impact. When you look at the testimony of the

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.580
Apostle Paul, you see a man that would go forth and boldly preach the Word of God,

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.620
but he lived the Word of God. Here in chapter number two, look down at

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.180
1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 7, the Bible says this,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:06.620
but we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. Again, he's

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.500
saying to these believers in Thessalonica, listen, you know how we

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:15.700
behaved ourselves, you know how we acted, you know what we did. The reality is that

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.020
in chapter number three, he talks about, you remember. Listen, he's writing to

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.460
people that he ministered to. He can't pull the wool over their eyes. He's saying

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.580
to them, you know how we behaved ourselves, you know how we were gentle among you, even

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:34.660
as a nurse cherisheth her children. Look down, if you will, at verse number 10 of

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:42.140
1 Thessalonians 2, verse number 10. He says, ye are witnesses, and God also. Wow,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:48.020
that is a weighty statement. Ye, believers in Thessalonica, that's who he's

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.340
writing to, right? Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus under the church of the

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:59.220
Thessalonians, verse number 1 of chapter 1. He says, ye are witnesses, and God also.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:08.620
How wholly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:15.540
Wow, what a great testimony. It's on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, right? The

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:23.140
Word of God. And Paul says, listen, ye are witnesses, God also. God knows all things.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.420
God sees all things. He says, and you understand what our behavior was. You understand how

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.100
we behaved ourselves among you that believe. He says, as the words that would be used to

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:44.500
describe their behavior, wholly, just, and unblameable. Wow. That's a fantastic testimony.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:50.260
He says, not only did we impart biblical truth, but we modeled biblical truth. We didn't

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.300
just tell you to not do these things or to do these things, but we lived the Word of

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.820
God. We find here in verse number 11, he says, as ye know, we've used this as our title

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.460
this morning, the last phrase, but notice the phrase again. He says in verse 10, ye

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:13.600
are witnesses. He says in verse number 11, as ye know, how we exhorted and comforted

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:24.640
and charged every one of you as a father doth his children. This morning, to the dads, do

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:33.080
your children see you model biblical truth? Do your children observe you living a life

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:43.200
pleasing to God, a life that matches the message of your lips? But to the mature believer,

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:50.720
I wonder are there some growing believers that look at your life and see, this is someone

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.800
that gets it. This is someone that's doing it, that they're obeying the Word of God.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.480
They're living the Word of God. I wonder this morning if we could make some of these same

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:09.040
statements that Paul makes. See, as we begin to think about this truth this morning, these

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.640
two principles, if you will, that we impart biblical truth, that we model biblical truth,

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.800
and keeping in mind all the while what that goal is, the goal is that ye, those that you're

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.620
ministering to, would walk worthy of God. And in order for me to achieve that goal,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.960
in order for me to see my children, in order for me to see some younger growing believers

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.640
walk worthy of God, I need to be imparting truth and I need to be modeling truth, biblical

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:45.440
truth. It's absolutely imperative. We notice the example of Paul. Of course, we're looking

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.080
at it here in the book of 1 Thessalonians. But I want to remind you, if you turn back

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.360
in your Bibles just a few pages to Philippians chapter number 4, I want to remind you what

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.560
Paul said to the believers in Philippi. Again, Philippi is the city that he was able to enter

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.360
into and minister amongst before he got to Thessalonica. And we can read of the record

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.480
of this ministry in Acts chapter number 16. And as Paul, under the inspiration of the

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.760
Holy Spirit of God, would write back to the church in Philippi, he gives them great instruction.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.480
He's writing from prison. He's talking about rejoicing evermore. Rejoice in the Lord,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.760
O Lord, and again I say rejoice. By the way, Paul was rejoicing, even in his circumstances,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.280
in his difficulties. I wonder this morning, as you think about the message of the book

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:36.800
of Philippians, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice. I wonder this morning about that Philippian

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.640
jailer when the book of Philippians was written and he read it. And he was the one that had

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:53.560
put them fast in the prison. But he heard them sing praises unto God. The Philippian

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:59.440
jailer got saved. He said, what must I do to be saved? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.360
Amen? And we find that that Philippian jailer was saved. But when Paul is saying rejoice

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.400
in everything, rejoice in the Lord, O way, I believe that that Philippian jailer, he

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.480
could say, you know, in the terrible circumstances that Paul was in, he was rejoicing. He's

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.320
writing from prison. He says in the first chapter, the things that happened to me have

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.840
happened for the furtherance of the gospel. He's rejoicing. But notice what he says in

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:38.080
verse number nine of Philippians 4. Those things which ye have both learned and received

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.920
and heard. Now those first three phrases of verse nine would be our first point this

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:51.320
morning, impart biblical truth. Ye have received it, you've learned it, you've received it,

00:36:51.320 --> 00:37:02.800
you've heard, but notice the last phrase, and seen in me do. The God of peace shall

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:10.280
be with you. Those things which I've imparted unto you, those things that you've learned,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.880
you've received, and you've heard, but those things that I modeled, that you've seen in

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:23.440
me do. Have you ever been in a place where maybe you or maybe someone else that was in

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.200
your presence, your company, had a child that behaved in a certain manner that was embarrassing?

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.160
The parent, maybe you were in the situation, or maybe it was another parent, says, I don't

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.160
know where they learned that. You ever been in a situation like that? You say, well, if

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.520
I could be honest with you, I could probably help you understand where they learned that

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:50.680
from. Amen? Because you know what children do? They model the behavior they see. I'm

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.000
not saying 100% of the time, forever of their lives, but many times children model that

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.760
which they see. We impart Biblical truth, but we model Biblical truth. Listen, the example

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.320
of Paul is great, but we have a greater example, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 1 says

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.560
this of the Lord Jesus Christ. Notice what the Word of God says in Acts 1. We'll be finishing

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:25.520
here in just a moment with this truth of the example of our wonderful Savior. Luke is writing

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.840
here and the Bible says this in Acts 1, in verse number 1, the former treaties have I

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:45.520
made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began, notice what it says, both to do and teach.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.520
This morning we acknowledge and understand that Jesus is the master teacher. Many times

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.800
when we read the Gospel accounts, we don't even see all of what He was teaching, but

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.920
we'll maybe just read a phrase of He was preaching or He was teaching. He's the master teacher.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:07.320
Nicodemus comes to Him by night. He says we know that thou art a teacher sent from God.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.200
And we find that as we look at the truth that God gives us in His Word of the Gospel records

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:19.240
and we understand that these truths are given to us as the life and ministry of the Lord

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:26.200
Jesus Christ, that it was both to do and teach. It was imparting truth, but it was

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:32.920
also modeling truth. And Jesus says this, and of course we know that He is perfect and

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.680
that He is the perfect example. He says in John 8, in verse number 29, for I do always

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:51.560
those things that please Him. I do always those things that please Him. This morning

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:59.600
Jesus is our example. Peter says that Christ left us an example that we should follow His

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.560
steps.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:06.720
And as we examine this morning, and we'll visit again this evening, the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:13.200
with this thought in mind, as a father doth his children, and looking at it from really two

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:21.040
perspectives, from fathers to children, but then from a mature believer to a growing believer.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.240
I'd ask you this question this morning in closing, or these two questions in closing this morning,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.760
to whom are you imparting biblical truth? To whom are you imparting biblical truth?

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.920
If you don't have an answer for that question, I would encourage you to find someone to impart

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:47.040
biblical truth to. I would challenge you not to be satisfied with a no one answer,

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.320
because we ought to be imparting biblical truth. If you can't remember the last time that you've

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.680
had an opportunity to share biblical truth and impart it to someone, I would encourage you this

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:07.520
morning to ask God to help you to impart biblical truth. And then I wonder this morning, how are we

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:18.240
doing in the area of modeling biblical truth? How many people do we want to see observing our lives?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:28.640
Can we say, as Paul said, that the things that you've seen in me do? I was teaching the teens

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:37.760
a couple of weeks ago, and I use really as a springboard verse of Scripture by which we'll

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:46.240
study throughout several weeks with the young people, this truth from 1 Samuel 16. And I won't

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.480
get into all of it, but Saul's dealing with an issue where he has an evil spirit that's troubling

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.440
him. And his counselors say, here's what we've got to do. We've got to find a man that can come in

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.320
and play, and man, this is going to be great. And they just go, okay, find him. And one of the

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.160
servants answered and said this in 1 Samuel 16, 18, just jot it down, and we can go back and read

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:20.240
it later. He says, behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, that is cunning and

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.840
playing, and a mighty, valiant man, a man of war, prudent in matters, a comely person, and the Lord

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.440
is with him. You know what I told the young people on Wednesday evening? Same thing I'm going to tell

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:40.240
you now. I'm not sure that David even knew who this servant was. I'm not sure that David knew

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.480
the servant was watching him, observing his behavior. You know what I told the young people?

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.320
When somebody says, I'm watching you, we can behave a certain way,

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.800
because we know somebody's watching us. I don't think David knew that this servant was watching

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:08.880
him. When they said, go find a man, and that servant says, I've seen, I've seen a son of Jesse,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:17.840
a Bethlehemite, and here's how he describes him. Wow. People are watching you. People are watching

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:26.720
me. A lot of people watch me. Seriously. I'm being honest, man. I'm not saying that pridefully,

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.440
I'm just saying, with a position comes just certain things come along with it.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:40.480
But you know, people are watching you. That person at work, that person in your neighborhood,

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.840
we need to find somebody to impart biblical truth to, but we need to make sure we're modeling

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.120
biblical truth. First two principles. Three more tonight. Come back tonight.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.400
Challenge you to come back. I really believe this morning that as we look at this, just an overview

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.160
of First Thessalonians, there's a lot more. I had a lot more in my notes that I could give you

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.440
principle-wise, but five of them that I really believe will go far if we implement them in our

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:16.240
lives to being able to see some people walk worthy of God. You know why? It's not going to happen by

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.840
chance or by accident. We have the purpose to impart and then model biblical truth.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:31.920
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you so much for the opportunity to gather

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:44.480
together, to honor fathers on this day, to rejoice in our relationship with you through the Lord

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:54.400
Jesus Christ. I'm challenged personally through the message of First Thessalonians,

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.840
the message from the perspective in which we've looked at it this morning.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.920
God, I pray that we would not soon forget that which we've heard.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:12.080
I pray that we'd truly allow the Holy Spirit of God to examine us. As we read in the end of First

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:19.760
Thessalonians 5, quench not the spirit. Grieve not the spirit, Paul says in another portion of

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:27.360
Scripture. Oh, God, I pray this morning that we'd be sensitive. We would not grieve nor quench

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.960
the Holy Spirit of God, but that we would be doers of the Word,

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.640
that we would understand the importance of imparting biblical truth.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:45.120
If we're not imparting biblical truth, God, would you help us to recognize the need

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.760
and to engage in seeking earnestly to find someone that we can impart biblical truth to?

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.120
God, help us always to model biblical truth,

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.600
understanding that you see us at all times. There are many people that are observing us

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:16.000
and we don't even know. As a man of yesteryear said, sometimes the only Bible a lost man will

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.760
ever read is the life of a believer. How much truth, biblical truth are we modeling? Oh, God,

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:32.080
help us. Help us to do business with thee. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. We pray

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.640
that you'd be glorified through every decision, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.600
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around. Kimberly's going to play

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.640
quietly on the piano. Maybe this morning you want to come to this old-fashioned altar. Maybe you

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:52.640
want to ask God to help you to impart biblical truth. Maybe you need to ask God to help you to

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.760
model biblical truth. However it is that God may have worked in your heart and life this morning,

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:07.920
would you allow God to have his way? The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
