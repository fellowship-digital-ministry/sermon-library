WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.119
the Oldenburg family tomorrow,

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:04.760
and they'll have a home-going celebration

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.760
for Mrs. Linda went home to be with the Lord.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.039
And so if you'd pray for that,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.859
I know that the family would greatly appreciate that.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.460
I believe it's scheduled for two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.719
And if you'd pray for that, I know they'd appreciate it.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:18.360
Psalm chapter number three,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.600
and we'll be looking at verses seven and eight this evening.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.639
Back on the 1st of December, the first week of December,

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:25.940
we started a mini-series through this psalm,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.520
Psalm chapter number three.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.959
And on the first six verses, we took two verses a week.

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.819
And during those first three lessons,

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.380
as we looked at this psalm,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.659
we discovered the reality of the situation

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:39.700
in verses one and two.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.939
In verses three and four,

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.540
we discovered the response of David to the situation.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.119
And then in verses five and six,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.659
we looked at the rest of David

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.139
and how that he rested in the Lord.

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.740
Notice in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.500
"'Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.979
"'Many are they that rise up against me,

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.500
"'many there be which say of my soul,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
"'there is no help for him in God, Selah.'"

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.160
This was the reality of the situation that David was facing.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.459
We know that the Bible teaches us,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.419
and as we look at contextually what's going on,

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:18.239
you look back and you can find that really the setting

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:22.339
of this particular psalm is believed to be

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:26.419
that of the revolt, the rebellion and revolt of Absalom.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.419
And you can read of that

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:30.620
in 2 Samuel chapters 15 through 19.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.900
And you see that it was a serious situation.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.680
David was not exaggerating the circumstances.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.099
He was not just pretending that this was some difficulty.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.540
This was a serious situation in which he was dealing with.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.279
And we noted the reality of the situation.

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.760
We said that the response to the situation

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.940
was noteworthy and exemplary.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.940
You find it in verses three and four.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.459
Notice what David says as he responds to the situation,

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.459
"'But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me.'"

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:01.819
Remember, they were saying

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.980
there is no help for him in God, Selah.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.699
But David says,

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:10.779
"'I understand, God, that you are a shield for me,

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.220
"'my glory and the lifter up of mine head.'"

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220
Notice what he says in verse number four,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.360
"'I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.619
"'and he heard me out of his holy hill, Selah.'"

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.539
Isn't that a great response to such a difficult situation?

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.899
And we find that it's important for us

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.139
to understand the response of David

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.380
and understand that we too should respond in like fashion

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.899
when we deal with difficulty and adversity

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.619
and troubles and trials, how we cry to the Lord,

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.339
how we trust in God and depend upon him.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.419
And after we pour out our heart to God,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.460
after we carry our burdens to the Lord,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.500
knowing that he cares for us,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.619
we find that we can have a great rest,

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.979
a great peace that passeth all understanding.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.020
And that's what we see in verses five and six.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.860
Notice the Bible says,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.899
"'I laid me down and slept.

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.660
"'I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.300
"'I will not be afraid of 10,000s of people

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.259
"'that have set themselves against me roundabout.'"

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.100
Why?

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.619
Because he's trusting in the Lord

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.820
and he's taken his burden to the Lord and he's laid it.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.460
The Bible tells us, "'Cast thy burden upon the Lord.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.860
"'He will sustain thee.'"

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.660
Knowing that we're to cast all of our care upon him.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.500
Why?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.899
"'For he careth for us, he careth for you.'"

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.500
And what great truth that is.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.660
And we find here in verses five and six,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.100
this great peace and this rest that David experiences.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740
And how in our lives,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.580
when we deal with troubles and trials and difficulties,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.339
we respond to those by going to God

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.179
and then we can rest knowing that God is able.

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.860
And what great truth that is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.820
and how important it is that we understand

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.020
that rest that is possible for us.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.820
This evening, as we look at verses seven and eight,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.779
we will note the rejoicing of David.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.179
I've used for the title,

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.940
the first phrase in verse number eight,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.020
"'Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.'"

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.660
But if you're kind of taking notes

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.100
for each of these lessons

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.820
and really looking at the four divisions of Psalm three,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.100
the rejoicing of David is what is in focus this evening.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.459
Notice in verse number seven,

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:27.940
the Bible says, "'Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.619
"'For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.179
"'Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:38.100
"'Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.420
"'Thy blessing is upon thy people, Selah.'"

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.899
So we note the rejoicing

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:46.459
and we think about the rejoicing of David

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.700
as it's seen in verses seven and eight.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.940
I wanna emphasize just for a moment

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.619
by way of introduction this evening,

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.059
the importance of praise in the life of a believer.

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.540
We understand that we have many reasons to rejoice.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.820
The Bible tells us in Psalm 118 and verse number 24,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.980
in fact, we sing the song often,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.700
this is the day the Lord hath made.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.820
We will what?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.420
Rejoice in it, right?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.619
And be glad.

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.700
And you think about that rejoicing,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.140
understanding that God has planned,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.459
that God has purpose, that God is in control.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:26.859
And we're gonna rejoice understanding who God is.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.260
Think about that great truth

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.380
that is given in Philippians chapter number four

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.660
and verse number four.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.859
Rejoice in the Lord, how often?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.540
All way, right?

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.339
Though he says rejoice in the Lord all way,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.019
again, I say rejoice.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.299
Well, that's impactful.

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.019
It's pretty plain, is it not?

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.700
Rejoice in the Lord all way.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.940
And again, I say rejoice.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.339
You know, as human beings,

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.140
we could identify and understand

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.619
there are times in which it seems to be

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.299
a little bit easier to rejoice

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:01.339
in our particular circumstances and situations.

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.220
But God tells us to rejoice in the Lord all way.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.380
And again, I say rejoice.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.980
Giving thanks always for all things.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.859
That's all-inclusive.

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:14.220
And that's the instruction that's been given to us

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.700
as the people of God.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.779
We find it in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 16.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.739
The Bible says this, rejoice evermore.

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:24.859
Simple, rejoice evermore.

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:26.980
And really, it's a mindset,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.380
it's a purpose that we have in our lives

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.739
that we are going to purpose to rejoice.

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:36.220
And we are going to look for,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.940
in every circumstance, in every situation,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.940
we're gonna find reason to rejoice.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.660
I don't wanna embarrass my mom this evening,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.019
but after Christmas, so don't let it be an embarrassment,

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.980
after Christmas, the family all left

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.220
on that Sunday afternoon.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.260
My brother left and my parents left.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.980
And Monday morning, I got to go out to the truck to leave

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.179
and I was looking for my coat

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.299
and my coat wasn't at my house.

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:04.980
And I thought, man, this is a problem.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.059
Where's my coat?

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:07.579
And so I came over to my office,

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.339
I looked in my office, it's not my office,

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.260
I went to the fellowship hall,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.019
I looked all over the place, can't find my coat.

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:13.859
And I said, you know what,

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:15.820
I bet you my mom grabbed it by accident.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.420
So I called my mom, mom, do you have my coat?

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.380
She's like, I don't know.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.260
Finds it, yep, here it is.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.540
And I said, well, I'm on my way.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.059
So I went to go pick it up.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.899
And in the midst of that situation,

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.059
I was really trying to follow

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:28.380
what I'm saying to you this evening.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.660
You know what the Lord gave me?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.459
I was thankful that my mom took it and not my brother.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.980
I had a 30 minute drive, not a five hour drive, right?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.700
And you say, that's just kind of elementary.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.820
I understand, but sometimes in life,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.700
something like that could irritate us, right?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.299
We say, man, we're inconvenienced,

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.500
it's an irritant, it's a problem.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.739
But the reality is that we can learn to rejoice.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:54.899
I don't know how that, as I look at a schedule,

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.459
and many of you know my personality,

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.660
I've been here for over 10 years,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.899
and some of you have been here for the duration of that,

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.459
and you know my personality.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:03.739
I'm a scheduled person.

00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:07.019
I like to stick to the punctuality and what have you.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.220
I had a plan as a time we were gonna leave

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.140
to go to visit Holly's family,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.859
and then all of a sudden, this thing happens,

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.500
and it could really twist you up.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.260
But how do I know if that 30 minute drive

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.859
to get my coat didn't keep us

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.739
from being in the midst of an accident

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:24.540
if we would have left at the time, right?

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.859
And we just have no idea.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:28.700
And what we do is in our lives,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.299
and I'm not perfect at it,

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:33.179
but we have to purpose to rejoice.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.739
As we look at the final two verses in Psalm 3,

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:39.739
we find the rejoicing of David.

00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:44.260
The situation, the reality of the situation was serious.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.099
I mean, it was a serious situation he was dealing with,

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.539
but he's relying upon the Lord.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.979
He's trusting God.

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.539
He's sought the face of God.

00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:56.340
He's resting in God, and now he is rejoicing.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.380
The first phrase in verse number seven

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.820
of our study this evening confirms for us two truths

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.500
that we find throughout the entirety of the Psalm.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.900
Notice the first phrase here in verse number seven.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.900
Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.780
I believe that in this statement

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.900
that the two truths that are confirmed to us are this,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.219
number one, David is confident in the Lord.

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:27.179
He is confident in the ability of God

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:29.739
and the power of the Lord to save him.

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:31.260
He is confident.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.140
He is convinced that God is able,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.059
and I believe he has that full confidence.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:40.739
And we need to have confidence in God as we live life,

00:09:40.739 --> 00:09:43.020
as we go through this journey,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.500
as we deal with difficulties and adversities,

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.700
that we can have confidence in knowing

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.380
that our God is able,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.179
that there's nothing that's too hard for him,

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.619
that there's no trial, no situation,

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:57.340
no circumstance that's beyond his ability,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.020
and we need to understand that we.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.660
are to be confident in him.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.200
I believe the second truth that is revealed to us

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.540
in this statement to begin verse number seven

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.760
is that David is dependent upon the Lord.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.260
Notice he says, arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.700
The personal relationship is there, obviously.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.640
He says, O my God, the personal understanding.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.260
But you find that he's dependent upon the Lord.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.560
He's trusting that God, he is confident in God's ability,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.380
but he's fully dependent on God to work.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.380
And how we need to depend upon God,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.740
trust in him wholly and completely,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.300
and you find that he is wholly true.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.860
And he is trustworthy, and we ought to rejoice in that.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.240
Now look at the rejoicing.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.420
Notice the remainder of verse number seven.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.940
Notice this, the Bible says,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.780
for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.020
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.700
I want you to notice the phrase that is repeated twice

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.140
in this portion of verse number seven.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.260
Notice the Bible says, thou hast.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.660
And when you see that phrase, he says,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.980
thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.520
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.140
What we find is that David is rejoicing,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.460
and we find that what God has done for us,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.860
and that which he has done on our behalf,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.360
should cause us to rejoice.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.540
When we look back and we remember the blessings of God,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.900
we remember the working of God,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.460
and we find that David here is looking back

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.900
and he's remembering what God has done.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.620
Thou hast done these things.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.580
And in Psalm 77 in verse number 10,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.180
the Bible says this, and I said, this is my infirmity,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.080
but I will remember the years of the right hand

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.380
of the Most High.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.820
I will remember the works of the Lord.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.060
Surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.700
I will meditate also of all thy work

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.140
and talk of thy doings.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.300
You know, it's a good thing for us

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.840
to remember what God has done.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.540
And as we remember what God has done,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.660
it should cause us to rejoice.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.400
Because we're acknowledging, we're meditating upon,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.540
we're remembering, we're rehearsing those things

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.500
in our mind, and he says, thou hast smitten

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.980
all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.260
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.900
And I find that David is rejoicing here,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.980
and he's rejoicing because God has worked.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.820
Not only should the recollection of God's working

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.060
and the remembrance that is mentioned here for,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.980
he's speaking of those past victories

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.140
and the past working of God,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.140
not only should that cause us to rejoice,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.320
but I believe this evening that it should cause us

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.780
to trust God in our current situation.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.200
Think about the rehearsing.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.760
Think about what he's remembering.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.280
It's just summarized in two statements.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.320
Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.280
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.960
But as David is the one that is penning this psalm,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.280
as he's recalling and remembering,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.420
you think about the floods of memories

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.400
that would permeate his mind as he's writing these words,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.160
and he's mindful of what God has done,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.400
which will result in the rejoicing,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.320
but it also leads to trusting,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.000
because if God was able to do it before,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.040
then he's able to do it now, right?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.040
God doesn't change.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.440
He's the same yesterday and today and forever,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.360
and we find here that David is rejoicing,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.300
but through the rejoicing as he set his mind,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.520
remember I said this, we must purpose to rejoice.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.440
This is the day the Lord hath made.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.280
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.760
Rejoice in the Lord always,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.280
and again I say rejoice, rejoice evermore.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.880
When I purpose to rejoice, all of a sudden,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.720
what's happening is my focus and my attention is Godward,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.180
instead of on my problem, instead of on my situation,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.280
and what we find is that God is greater

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.060
than any situation that we face.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.160
What happens so often in our lives

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.720
is that we have so much of our focus

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.440
and so much of our attention upon our problem,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.640
and our problem just continues to grow and grow and grow,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.200
and we're just so focused upon our problem

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.840
that we're not rejoicing as we see David doing here,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.240
and therefore our attention is not Godward.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.620
We're just so focused on whatever the problem at hand is.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.240
We mentioned that in the response in verses three and four

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.840
when he responded by praising the Lord,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.080
thanking God for who he is,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.720
and declaring his dependence upon God

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.120
in verses three and four,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.360
and as we noted that in that study a few weeks ago,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.080
we understood that that too is how we should respond,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.560
and when we respond in that fashion,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.600
our attention is upon the Lord.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.040
The more we focus on a problem,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.280
the bigger the problem becomes.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.940
It just can consume us,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.880
and we find here that his attention is Godward.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.720
Why?

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.120
Because he's rejoicing,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.280
because he's praising God for what he, God,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.800
has done on his behalf.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.540
Notice in verse number eight that David recognizes

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.800
that salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.880
This here, as you often find in the Old Testament,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.040
especially in the Book of Psalms,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.240
the term salvation is not the same use of the word

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.600
that we would use in New Testament Christianity

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.160
of being saved, being born again,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.220
but it's a word that is often used

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.340
to simply deal with deliverance.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.740
Now, we understand when we speak of our salvation

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.380
that we're speaking about our deliverance

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.540
from the penalty of sin,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.940
and here, in many other areas in the Book of Psalms,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.500
when you read the salvation that is being discussed,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.420
he's speaking about the deliverance that God has provided,

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.460
such as what he has mentioned in verse number seven,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.060
where God had smitten all his enemies

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.500
and broken the teeth of the ungodly,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.640
and notice the recognition here.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.120
The very truth of this recognition

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.340
that salvation or deliverance belongs to God

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.060
would cause us to rejoice.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.760
It's not in my power, it's not in my ability

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.880
to provide deliverance.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.440
It's not up to me to come up with the plan for deliverance.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.120
You think about the life of David,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.700
and you think about the many victories,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.640
the triumphs of David as you read throughout his life.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.080
Remember, this is near the end of his life.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.640
This is during the time of the rebellion

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.960
and revolt of Absalom,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.600
and you think about all that has taken place

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.520
prior to that in the life of David,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.360
and you read of all of his triumphs and all of the victories,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.200
and as you begin to fill your mind

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.200
with recalling those great things

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.680
that are recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.380
and reading of all of those great victories,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.360
you find that David, as he makes the statement,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.600
salvation belongeth unto the Lord,

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.160
that just the recognition of that truth

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.520
would lead to rejoicing,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.880
thanking God that he is our deliverer,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.420
that he is the one that provides deliverance.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.880
David fought many times against the Philistines,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.040
and it started, of course, we understand,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.180
in that great battle against Goliath,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.440
and we're familiar with 1 Samuel in chapter number 17,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.400
and we look at that passage of Scripture,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.420
and it's a very prominent portion of Scripture,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:45.060
and one in which we find just great encouragement,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.220
and the reality is that when David goes

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.500
to fight against Goliath,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.120
he was not depending upon himself.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.760
When Saul tries to give him the armor

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.420
and all that he tries to give him,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.000
David understands that, listen,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.900
salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.340
He understood that it was God

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.780
that had delivered him previously,

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.680
and that it was God that would fight on his behalf.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.920
There were times in which he fought the Philistines,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.520
and there were times in which the Philistines

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.160
invaded cities, and David would seek the face of God.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.080
He would inquire of the Lord to find out,

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.340
what shall I do, how should I proceed?

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.640
And God would answer, and God would provide direction,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.200
and as he was depending upon the Lord,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.920
he understood that it was the Lord

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.840
that brought the deliverance.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.080
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.360
Often in our lives, we begin to think about

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.000
these great truths like what we find

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.760
declared here in verse number seven and eight,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.220
how that we would take those truths

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.000
and allow those to be a catalyst to our rejoicing.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.000
When you think about the importance of rejoicing

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.800
in the life of a believer,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.920
and the prominence of rejoicing in our lives,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.220
and that the Lord is worthy of our praise,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.860
then there's some statements, some truths such as this

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.040
that will be utilized in our lives

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.400
as a catalyst to cause us to rejoice.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.739
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord,

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.940
and we just begin to think about the deliverance

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.420
that he's provided for us as New Testament believers

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.460
as we use that term salvation to speak about our redemption.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.619
Oh man, how that brings a whole nother dynamic

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:29.679
to the equation and understanding

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.820
that redemption is only through the blood

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.100
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.179
and how that ought to cause us to rejoice.

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:40.500
I couldn't save myself and you can't save yourself, right?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.820
It's impossible.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.220
And so we understand even as we would take that term

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.260
and utilize it and apply it the way that we would

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.520
as New Testament believers,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.540
we can rejoice in understanding

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.300
that salvation belongeth unto the Lord.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.780
And I'm thankful that he's a wonderful savior.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.220
Notice the last statement of verse number eight.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:07.260
Okay, thy blessing is upon thy people.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.920
Selah.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.620
To finish out the psalm,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.480
we find that David references

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.340
the blessing of God.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.080
You think about the blessing of God.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.300
I'm so thankful for God's good hand of blessing.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.340
I'm thankful for the many blessings

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.120
that He's bestowed upon us.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.760
We sing songs about count your blessings,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.000
name them one by one.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.800
We understand that as we would consider

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.420
thy blessing is upon thy people,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.760
again, a reason to rejoice

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.220
in the rejoicing of David,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.760
a catalyst if you will,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.040
just as we saw in that first statement

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.160
of verse 8,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.320
to lead us, to lead David

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.080
to a place of rejoicing.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.320
And I want you to understand

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.280
that as David is remembering

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.840
the fact that God is blessing

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.040
and that His blessing is upon His people,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.820
we must be mindful of this truth

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.660
this evening that God's blessings

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.200
come in different forms

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.000
and at different times.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.280
There can be something in our life

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.880
that's a blessing and sometimes

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.880
we don't really look at it

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.280
as being a blessing

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.840
because we just have a wrong perspective

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.800
because we think that a blessing

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.180
is something that is defined

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.280
by our finite ability to describe

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.680
or to define what a blessing is,

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.000
but the reality is that

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.280
in God's infinite wisdom

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.560
and in His mercy,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.000
He gives blessings to His people

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.160
and there are times in which

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.960
we may not even recognize things

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.400
as being blessings.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.000
I finished reading the book of Genesis

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.160
this morning in my personal devotions

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.680
and I was mindful again

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.640
of just the wonderful account

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.160
of the life of Joseph

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160
and many of you know

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.080
that he's my favorite Bible character

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.240
and as I was reading once again

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.400
that portion of Scripture

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.360
that details all that takes place

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.720
at the deliverance of the people of God

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.280
through the provision

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.080
and that provision being the result

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.400
of Joseph being in that place.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.920
When Joseph revealed himself

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.080
to his brothers,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080
he tells them,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.440
God sent me before you

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.280
to preserve life.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.360
When Dad dies

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.520
and the brothers send a servant

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.080
to say, hey, before Dad died,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.840
he told us that you should forgive us

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.960
for our evil that we did unto you.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.160
And Joseph says, yes,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.360
you meant it for evil,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.000
but God meant it for good

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.280
to save much people alive.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.080
Man, can you imagine?

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.280
In fact, as you look

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.680
at the life of Joseph

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.160
and you understand

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.360
what's taking place there

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.480
and you see how God was working,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.200
it's very challenging for us

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.480
in the midst of the situation

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.960
to understand all that's taking place.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.880
But I want you to be mindful.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.160
And of course, in our study

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.200
through the book of Genesis,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.880
we'll get here eventually.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.280
But in chapter number 41,

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.960
just real quickly,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.240
the sons of Joseph are listed

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.320
Manasseh and Ephraim.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.280
And Manasseh,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.360
he named his firstborn Manasseh

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.800
according to Genesis 41 and 51

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.840
for God said he hath made me

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.440
to forget all my toil

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.920
in all my father's house

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.520
and then he named his second son

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.440
Ephraim and notice what he says.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.080
For God hath caused me to be fruitful

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.760
in the land of my affliction.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.680
Thinking about the blessings of God.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.720
And I don't think even at that point,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.760
as you understand what's taking place

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.560
and you're acknowledging

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.360
the the timeline

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.800
and what's going on here

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.320
at this particular time,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.040
Joseph's brothers had not yet

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.800
come to visit Egypt.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.560
But it was through

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.440
all of those circumstances

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.240
that had taken place in Joseph's life

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.520
that God allowed him to be in the place

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.600
where he was to preserve life.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.400
It's amazing.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.480
Sometimes as we look at a truth

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.120
such as this in verse number eight,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.480
really in verses seven and eight,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.080
as we think about what's taking place

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.240
in the rejoicing,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.600
it's hard for us to understand

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.040
how we could rejoice

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.360
in times of great difficulty.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.320
But the reality is that we can

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.120
and we should.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.800
The situation is still the situation.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.000
Verses one and two

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.360
is still the situation,

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.920
the reality of the situation,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.160
the rebellion, the revolt of Absalom.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.600
And we find that he's responded

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.080
by depending upon the Lord,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.520
crying out to the Lord,

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.480
acknowledging who God is

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.320
and what God is able to do.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.560
We find that after David

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.080
pours out his heart to God,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.240
he remembers and recalls

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.160
who God is to him

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.600
and how God will work on his behalf

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.600
that he rests in the Lord.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.320
He's taken his burden to the Lord

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.400
and he now rests.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.640
And the Bible tells us

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.960
that he's rejoicing.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.720
It's interesting,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.080
as you note the truth,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.240
if you want to take a moment

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.040
and turn to the book of Philippians

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.200
and the fourth chapter,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.240
we've mentioned already

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.480
verse number four

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.600
by way of introduction,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.960
rejoice in the Lord always.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.320
And again, I say rejoice.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.000
A few verses later,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
we find the Bible tells us

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.120
this truth about being careful

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.880
for nothing in Philippians

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.000
four and verse number six.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.040
Be careful for nothing.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.880
But in everything,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.880
by prayer and supplication

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.840
with thanksgiving,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.760
let your requests

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.000
be made known unto God,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.760
it says, and the peace of God,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.800
which passeth all understanding

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.080
shall keep your hearts

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.200
and minds through Christ Jesus.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.040
Paul goes on to say

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.880
in verse number 10,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.640
but I rejoiced in the Lord

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.040
greatly that now at the last

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.760
your care of me

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.920
hath flourished again,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.360
wherein you were also careful,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.080
but you lacked opportunity.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.000
Not that I speak

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.920
in respect of want,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.720
for I have learned

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.560
in what sort of state

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.880
I am there with to be content,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.200
understanding that God's purposes

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.320
in his in his life

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.600
are for a purpose and for a reason

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.400
and therefore his good.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.200
But you notice,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.280
as you look at verses

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.680
four through seven

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.880
and you compare that

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.440
with the truth of Psalm three

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.400
that we've studied here

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.360
for four weeks now

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.720
on Wednesday evening

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.320
and you see the rejoicing,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.160
it's kind of reverse order,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.480
but you see the rejoicing

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.440
in the Lord always.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.760
And again, I say rejoice.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.640
We see that in verses seven

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.440
and eight of Psalm three.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.360
You find that he says,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.400
be careful for nothing,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.640
but in everything by prayer

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.520
and supplication

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.760
with thanksgiving,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.720
let your requests

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.880
be made known unto God.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.160
And really in Psalm three,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.320
you see that in verses

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.840
three and four.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.920
The peace of God

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.640
that is mentioned

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.640
in verse number seven

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.920
of Philippians four

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.320
is what we see in verses

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.440
five and six of Psalm three,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.680
where there's that great peace,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.920
the rest that David experiences.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.920
And then, of course,

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.680
the situation

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.640
or the circumstance,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.600
really, you'd have to look

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.840
at the entirety

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.080
of the book of Philippians

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.040
to understand that Paul is writing

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.080
from a place of Roman prison.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.920
And Paul's writing

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.200
from a place of Roman prison,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.120
but he's rejoicing.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.560
It's a book that really

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.640
the theme of the book

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.360
of Philippians

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.600
is the joy of the Lord and rejoice.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.200
And Paul's writing from prison.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.800
He's saying rejoice.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.720
In fact, it's in my mind,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.840
it's so connected

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.320
when you think about the theme

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.800
of the book of Philippians

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.560
and the repeated reference

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.040
to rejoicing,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.080
because you'll recall

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.720
that while Paul and Silas

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.520
were in prison

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.840
after they'd been beaten

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.640
and cast in the inner prison,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.320
it was there

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.240
that they were rejoicing.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.000
They're praying and singing

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.640
praise unto the Lord.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.160
They're rejoicing.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.880
God worked.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.560
God moved the earthquake.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.760
And we, of course,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.200
are familiar with the response

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.000
of the Philippian jailer.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.920
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.480
In that adverse situation,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.480
the circumstance

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.080
that Paul and Silas

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.920
could have been in there

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.240
saying this isn't fair,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.160
they've falsely accused us

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.280
and they've beaten us

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.880
and so on and so forth.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.280
And I just can't believe

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.160
we're in this place.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.320
We're just trying to serve God.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.160
All we're trying to do

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.000
is obey God

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.120
and look at what's happened.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.520
Look at what it's got us.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.840
Do you think the Philippian jailer

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.560
would say, sirs,

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.120
what must I do to be saved?

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.440
I have a hard time believing

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.000
that they would respond that way.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.280
But when they hear,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.400
when he hears men

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.560
that are praising God

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.880
after being beaten.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.040
That are rejoicing

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.680
and singing and praying.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.160
Man, that's impactful.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.960
This evening, as we conclude

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.280
our mini series on Psalm three,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.000
I hope that we've been encouraged.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.920
We've understood

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.960
that we can relate to the psalmist

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.000
and so many other portions

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.720
of Scripture

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.320
throughout the word of God

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.680
that is relatable to us

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.560
as human beings,

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.560
that David was a man.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.360
He was a human being just as we are,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.760
and he dealt with difficulties

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.600
and adversities.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.800
And when we think about

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.440
the reality of the situation

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.800
and the pressures of life

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.320
and the oppositions

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.240
that we deal with,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.960
how do we respond to those?

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.360
We must respond the way

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.680
that David did in verses

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.880
three and four.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880
We must respond

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.120
by reminding ourselves

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.080
who our God is to us.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.560
He's my shield,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.360
my protector, my defender.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.840
He's my glory.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.520
He's the lifter up of my head.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.840
When the when the world

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.080
seems to be against us

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.560
and we can find ourselves

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.760
becoming discouraged,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.480
and I mentioned this

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.960
when we looked at

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.200
that second lesson,

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.120
there are times in which

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.640
you think about

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.960
a discouraged individual.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.720
What you think about

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.480
their countenance

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.640
is that their their head is downward.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.960
But God is the lifter up of my head.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.360
He encourages us.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.280
What a joy that is.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.320
That is.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.600
And once we cast our burden unto the Lord,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.960
knowing that He will sustain us,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.840
we need to leave it with Him

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.960
and just rest in God.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.360
Knowing that God is able.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.400
Be careful for nothing.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.280
Knowing that He is able to do in that situation

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.680
what I cannot do,

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.600
what you cannot do.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.080
And He's able to make it good.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.360
He's able to bring out of that situation

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.320
something far greater than we could ever bring out of that situation.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.280
And we know that all things work together for good, right?

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.120
Romans 8 and verse number 28.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.600
He wants us to know that.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.800
He wants us to have confidence in that.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.400
You know, that God would help us to rejoice.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.760
In the midst of difficulties? Absolutely.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.040
Because He says,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.240
this is the day the Lord hath made.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.760
I will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.880
Rejoice in the Lord always.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.920
And again, I say rejoice.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.320
Rejoice evermore.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.880
There's really no wiggle room in the Scriptures

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.880
to say, you know what?

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.720
I deserve to be able to complain about this situation.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.560
You're not going to find any wiggle room in the Word of God.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.200
He says rejoice.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.120
And when we know who our God is,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.600
and when we know what He's able to do,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.160
it'll lead us to rejoicing.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.920
Oh, that God would help us to rejoice

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.280
even in the midst of great difficulty.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.280
Father, we love You and we thank You for loving us.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.880
We thank You for this short psalm.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.600
That's been an encouragement to me.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.840
I trust a help to those that have had the opportunity

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.480
to hear the teaching of Your Word.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.880
God, I know that each one of us

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.640
deal with a variety of difficulties.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.040
And I know that sometimes those difficulties

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.040
can be greater than at other times.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.120
But God, we rejoice in knowing that You're greater.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.640
That You have a plan and a purpose.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.160
And though we may not always understand it,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.680
it is important that we rest in that fact, that truth.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.040
God, would You help us to have confidence in who You are

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040
and what You're able to do?

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:31.680
Would You help us to depend upon You wholly, fully, completely?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.680
Would You help us to rejoice, to rejoice greatly?

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.000
Thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.280
I pray that You'd bless our time.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.520
We'll thank You for what You'll do.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.880
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.360
Someone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
