WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.059
Section of 2nd Corinthians chapter number 12 when he says that the Lord responded and said my grace is sufficient for thee

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:12.039
but the latter part is this for my strength is made perfect in weakness and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.879
So thankful for the work of God in our lives

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.440
Reminded from the book of John in the 15th chapter without him

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.559
we can do nothing that he is the vine and we're simply the branches and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.240
What a joy to know the Lord as our personal Savior and that he would work in and through us Hebrews chapter number 5

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.400
Hebrews chapter number 5 would be looking at 11 through 14 verses 11 through 14 today

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.560
Hebrews 5

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.939
Verses 11 through 14 and as we continue through the book of Hebrews as we've been studying here Hebrews

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.720
On Sunday mornings our theme looking unto Jesus from Hebrews 12 and verse number 1

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.279
He is the author and finisher of our faith and so thankful as I've mentioned many times during this pandemic

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.080
That we can have the peace of God which passeth all understanding

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.839
Not because we have our head in the sand

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:13.599
But because we have our eyes on our Savior and we are looking unto Jesus and I'm so thankful in God's

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.239
Divine plan and his wisdom. He led me to this particular study for

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:22.400
2020 of course back in September of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.080
2019 is when God made it clear for me

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.680
That we would go through the book of Hebrews and have as our theme looking unto Jesus

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.959
I never could have expected what we would deal with in

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.360
2020 someone made a meme again. We use that word. It's kind of interesting

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.720
I use that on one of those services and I had a bunch of teenagers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.599
Let me know what meme means and I said, well, I'm just glad to know that the teenagers are listening

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.400
amen, but the reality is that somebody said

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.239
2020 came out looking like a

00:01:55.559 --> 00:02:00.000
Chocolate chip cookie and I know Kimberly you love chocolate chip cookies

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.720
And it was just looking just so desirable and then you bit into it and BAM

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.520
It was an oatmeal raisin cookie, you know, and that's just so just ah

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.119
you know those of you that like oatmeal raisin the Lord bless you and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.679
I'm not really too interested in oatmeal raisin cookies

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:23.039
But anyway, I thought that was kind of funny. Somebody sent that to me yesterday and I thought that was kind of funny

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.119
However as we get here to Hebrews chapter number 5 and looking at verses 11 through 14

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.720
Really what we see is the third warning passage in the book of Hebrews

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.360
We've mentioned as we've studied through the book of Hebrews that we have found that there's instruction that is given and then we'll come to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.000
A warning passage and then there's more instruction and then a warning passage

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.600
this is our third warning passage if you were with us last week and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.759
Sunday morning Hebrews 5 verses 1 through 10

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:55.600
our great high priest and we dealt with the importance of that passage of Scripture and just how

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.419
Foundational the truth is and all that God would give us remember

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.679
It was the subject of Christ's price priesthood and how his priesthood is superior

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.000
to the Aaronic priesthood and we dealt with

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:17.880
the introduction of that subject in the first 10 verses of Hebrews 5 and I made note last week that this

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:24.559
Teaching this truth would be further developed in Hebrews 7 8 9 and 10

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:30.600
There's a lot of information that is given to us about Christ's priesthood and why it's superior how it's superior

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.360
in fact

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.720
we found that as we studied last week in these first 10 verses that he deals with the subject of Melchizedek and the fact that

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.399
The Lord Jesus Christ is not after the order of Aaron or the Levitical priesthood

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.639
But that he was after the priesthood of Melchizedek that great truth in Psalm

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.919
110 that Messianic Psalm that talked about a greater priest that would come

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:02.240
And we find that the Bible fulfills that gives us the fulfillment of that in verse number six and helps us to interpret

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720
the truth of Psalm 110

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.320
Where the Bible says thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.920
I made this statement last week of why this was so important and so significant was because priests were from the tribe of Levi

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.920
However, the Lord Jesus Christ we know is from the tribe of Judah

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.200
So he could not be a priest after the Levitical priesthood after the order of Aaron

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.239
But we find that he is our great high priest and he's after the order of Melchizedek

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:39.839
It's interesting because chapter number seven deals in a great deal with the priesthood of Melchizedek and gives us all sorts of information

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:44.160
and really deals with that but we come to verse 11 of chapter 5 and

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.880
really all of chapter number 6 and see that it's a warning passage and so as

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.000
The writer of under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.519
We find in verse number 10 called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
but then look at verse number 11 of

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:05.720
Whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:09.359
Seeing ye are dull of hearing

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.559
For when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.959
Which be the first principles of the oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.720
For everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.880
For he is a babe, but strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.000
Even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.440
The phrase at the end of verse number 11 will serve as our title today

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880
ye are dull of

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:47.720
hearing and

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.600
We find this warning passages given to us

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.679
It's interesting as we would note the subject and how that it would be further developed in Hebrews 7 8 9 and 10

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.640
the subject of Christ's priesthood and how it's superior, but this warning passage is given to us and it's it's really

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.640
Right at the appropriate spot. We understand the scriptures are given by inspiration of God

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.200
They're perfect and we find that God gives this warning to the recipients

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.959
It's interesting if we consider the other warnings that we've studied thus far

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:25.000
The first warning was given to us in Hebrews 2 verses 1 through 4

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.600
I preached a message from that passage of scripture that I entitled listen up

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.920
Listen up

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.440
Notice in verse number 1 of Hebrews 2 the Bible says therefore we ought to give the more earnest

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.519
Heed to the things which we have heard

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:45.279
Lest at any time we should let them slip and there was the potential of letting these things slip

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.320
and so we preached a message on listen up and how we need to give our

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.519
Attention to the teaching and preaching of the Word of God to the Word of God

00:06:53.839 --> 00:07:00.040
That's been delivered to us and what a joy to have the Bible and we must listen up

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.519
we find that the second warning is really contained in Hebrews 3 beginning in verse number 7 and

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.600
Going through chapter number 4 in verse number 13, and it's a lengthy warning and in that passage of scripture

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.600
I actually preached two messages, but one that really

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.320
Captures the warning was this hearing and believing

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.000
Hearing and believing you remember in Hebrews chapter 4 in verse number 1

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.760
It says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:37.160
Entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.720
So you see that distinction between us and them that is given here and it says but the word preached did not profit them

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:51.239
notice not being mixed with faith in them that heard it and of course the

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.000
Example is given throughout the passage of scripture with regard to Old Testament Israel and their

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:04.279
Unbelief and their heart and heart and remember he had mentioned in chapter number 3 about that event

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:11.920
That's recorded in numbers 13 and 14 when those 12 spies went out and the 10 came back with that evil report and there

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.480
they did not believe what God said and the danger of not believing thus we

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.679
Receive the warning and we receive the instruction to hear and believe of course the Word of God

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.520
Gives us the importance of being doers of the word and not hearers only if we believe it

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.159
I've often said that our belief will impact our behavior

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:44.880
On the flip side of that coin is that our behavior reveals our belief and we find here as we come to this third

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:50.359
Warning section that he says to these recipients that they are dull of

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:55.039
Hearing the word literally means slow or sluggish

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.840
It carries with the idea of being slothful. It's interesting. It's that's the

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.440
way that Hebrews 6 and verse number 12 the same Greek word that's used here to

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.840
Being translated dull of hearing is translated in Hebrews 6 and verse number 12

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.599
It says that you be not slothful. And so we see that

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:21.400
The the writer of Hebrews he's being very direct. The Word of God is direct

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.960
the gospel is confrontational and

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.320
we find that there are plenty of examples throughout the Word of God where we are confronted with truth where we are

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:39.000
Receiving the direct nature of God as he would meet us where we are and he would come and he would

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.359
Give us truth. The Word of God is direct. Listen, the writer of Hebrews is not being unkind to the recipients. He's not

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.919
seeking to

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:54.440
diminish them in any sense of their value or to criticize them in a sense of

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.880
Tearing them down. No, he's seeking to edify and to encourage them, but he's pointing out

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:07.100
a reality that they were dull of hearing and therefore he was not able to teach

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.400
them all that he wanted to teach them at that particular time and therefore this

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.480
warning is given. Oh that we would take heed to the warning and we'll mention

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.820
things at the end of the message this morning that we would never be

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.460
categorized as one that is dull of hearing. We find in the text of Scripture

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.680
if you're taking notes number one the imparting of spiritual truth the

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.240
imparting of spiritual truth notice what is said in Hebrews 5 in verse number

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.440
11 of course it's the continuation of what we found in our previous text when

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.200
he's speaking about the order of Melchizedek and Christ being an high

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.920
priest after the order of Melchizedek notice in verse 11 of whom notice this

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.960
phrase we have many things to say we have many things to say as I look at

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.080
that phrase in verse number 11 I am reminded of the imparting of spiritual

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.540
truth and really the desire of the spiritual leader to impart spiritual

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.440
truth as we would think about the writer of the book of Hebrews as we would think

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.160
about the the spiritual leaders that we find throughout the Word of God as we

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.400
would consider those that have been spiritual leaders in our own lives as we

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.600
would begin to understand their desire to impart spiritual truth to teach the

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.520
Word of God see we find that the teaching that that we are to give is

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.000
really in following the truth of the Great Commission it's wonderful to see

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.880
people saved and to see people baptized but there is that portion of the Great

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.080
Commission that deals with discipleship and we think about the imparting of

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.680
spiritual truth and how wonderful that is I want you to go back to Matthew 28

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.880
and I want you to consider what is said here in this passage of Scripture this

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.520
is the first record that we have of the Great Commission of course it's given in

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.560
all four of the Gospels again in the book of Acts and we find here that as

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.320
the Great Commission is given in Matthew 28 verses 18 through 20 the Bible says

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.919
this and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:20.600
heaven and in earth go ye therefore notice the first aspect and teach all

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.120
nations that's the first aspect of the Great Commission and that's really

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.919
dealing with the gospel giving the gospel to all nations the fact that

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:33.840
Christ died according to the Scriptures that he was buried and that he rose

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.960
again on the third day according to the Scriptures the gospel the good news of

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.200
Jesus Christ and we find that we're to give the gospel to teach all nations

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.279
notice baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:53.440
Ghost the second aspect of the Great Commission is that of baptism baptism

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.919
cannot save you there are some that would rely upon their baptism is their

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:02.639
reason for being saved or being born again that you'd ask someone are you

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:06.040
going to heaven are you a hundred percent sure if you were to die today

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.840
that heaven's your home I've had people tell me yes because they were baptized

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.680
baptism cannot save you it's only the blood of Jesus Christ that can save you

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.279
and after the gospel is preached then there's that that Oh that first act of

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:26.720
obedience which is baptism we find that it's that identification with the Lord

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.000
Jesus Christ it is that I am identifying with him because I'm now a child of his

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.880
it's interesting you don't need to turn there but in Romans chapter number six

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.960
we find that Paul deals with this truth with regard to baptism and he says this

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.880
in verse 3 know you not that so many of us were as were baptized into Jesus

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.160
Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.960
baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory

00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:01.000
of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life I cannot save

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.160
you but it is the first step of obedience for every child of God you

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.600
remember with Philip there the evangelist in the Ethiopian eunuch in

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.639
Acts chapter number 8 the the man is reading the book of Isaiah he's reading

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:20.119
in the 53rd chapter and God calls Philip and tells him to go and to join himself

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:24.320
to this Ethiopian eunuch and he's reading and the man has no idea what

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.800
he's reading and he says who speaks this man of himself or of someone else and

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.160
Philip preaches Christ to this man and he says he responds to to Philip and he

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.200
says see here's water what does hinder me to be baptized we find that what

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.279
hindered him to be baptized was the fact that he needed to be saved first we find

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:48.880
that Philip responds to him in that manner it's interesting that as we would

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.320
look at the passage of Scripture and see the bold declaration of this eunuch we

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.760
find that Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.520
answered that eunuch said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and then

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.600
he was baptized when we have a baptismal service when someone is following the

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.360
Lord and believers baptism we ask them are you a hundred percent sure if you

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.959
were to die today that heaven's your home have you trusted the Lord Jesus

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:24.880
Christ and his finished work at Calvary for your salvation yes I have based

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.200
upon your profession of faith I now baptize you in the name that's how we

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.839
follow why because that's the example the pattern that we see in the Word of

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:37.559
God so the first aspect of the Great Commission to teach all nations to give

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:41.480
the gospel number two to baptize but notice the third aspect is it's given to

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.600
us in Matthew 28 in verse number 20 teaching them to observe all things

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.239
whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:59.559
the world amen that third aspect of the Great Commission is vital it's so

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:04.720
important that we would be engaged in the work of discipleship I've thoroughly

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.279
enjoyed over the years the opportunity to have discipleship classes with

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:15.399
individuals and to go through various curriculum and to have them learn and to

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:20.160
teach them and to sit across a desk or around a table and to engage in the work

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.119
of discipleship and we find that there's yes teaching that takes place within the

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:29.600
services of the church and as a pastor I have the responsibility to feed the

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.880
flock of God that's what God tells me is one of my jobs you read that in first

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.839
Peter chapter number five that instruction has been given to pastors to

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:43.880
feed the flock of God and oh how I long to be obedient to that instruction and

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.480
to that requirement to feed the flock of God but to be involved in discipleship

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:56.920
to teach people to impart the spiritual truth we find that here as we would look

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:03.080
at the writing of this warning the the beginning of the warning he says we have

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.600
many things to say the imparting of spiritual truth I think about what Paul

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.239
said now again you don't need to turn there but in Acts chapter number 20 in

00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:17.360
verse number 20 as Paul is speaking to the Ephesian elders he had called them

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.600
there and he's speaking to them and he says this in verse number 20 of Acts 20

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.480
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have showed you

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.279
and have taught you publicly and from house to house see Paul was engaged in

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:35.760
giving spiritual truth and imparting spiritual truth to those that God

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.760
enabled him to have a ministry to and we see throughout the life and ministry of

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.839
the Apostle Paul how that he faithfully imparted spiritual truth he says to

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.200
Timothy in 2nd Timothy 2 in verse number 2 and the things that thou hast heard of

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.440
me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.440
to teach others also that process of discipleship that imparting of spiritual

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.559
truth and we find that there's a desire for the imparting of spiritual truth

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:15.000
there are many things to say there's a problem there's an issue at hand if

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.200
there are many things to say we could have skipped from verse number 10 to

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.720
right to chapter number 7 and dealt with that which Paul wanted to say or the

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.880
writer of Hebrews here wanted to say no we we do not believe that there was

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.640
anything that was difficult on the part of the one giving the instruction see it

00:18:36.679 --> 00:18:41.119
wasn't a matter of the the spiritual leader not being able to impart the

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:46.160
spiritual truth the problem was on the recipients that's why the warning is

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.720
given it we find that there's the imparting of spiritual truth number two

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.080
if you're taking notes the immaturity of the Saints the immaturity of the Saints

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.400
notice as we finish verse number 11 he says of whom we have many things to say

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.720
and hard to be uttered seeing your doll of hearing they weren't hard to be

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.000
uttered because he didn't know how to give the truth they weren't hard to be

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.919
uttered because he couldn't formulate that which he wanted to give no they

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:21.400
were hard to be uttered because you are dull of hearing because the recipients

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.160
because of the immaturity of the Saints and we find that this immaturity that is

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.479
given to us in these verses of Scripture we find that as a result of the fact

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:35.679
that they were dull of hearing notice it says that you're dull of hearing and

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:39.840
then notice as we continue in verse number 12 notice what he says for when

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:45.799
for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:51.520
which be the first principles of the oracles of God so we find that the

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.679
immaturity of the Saints is revealed to us through the fact that they had need

00:19:54.679 --> 00:19:59.479
that one teach them but notice what the Word of God says it says you have need

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:03.479
Notice this word, again.

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:06.379
You have need that one teach you again, what?

00:20:06.379 --> 00:20:09.179
Which be the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:11.379
In other words, the basics.

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:13.979
And you have need that one teach you again.

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.579
It was not that they had not been taught.

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.179
It was that they were dull of hearing.

00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:24.379
And we find that the problem with the recipients

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:27.979
being dull of hearing led to their spiritual immaturity.

00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:30.779
He tells them that they have need that one teach them again.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:33.479
These first principles of the oracles of God.

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:35.779
He then tells them that they have need of milk.

00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:37.279
Notice at the end of verse number 12,

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:42.079
and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.279
For everyone that useth milk is unskillful

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:48.979
in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.

00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:52.779
Now, the reality is that this is not an insult

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:55.479
against babes in Christ.

00:20:55.479 --> 00:20:58.479
We all trust at Christ at some point in our lives.

00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:00.679
And when we trust at Christ as our Savior,

00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:04.979
the Bible likens us to that truth of the second birth

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:06.779
and we are babes in Christ.

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:10.079
And as babes in Christ, we are to grow and we are to develop.

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:12.579
We are to go on to spiritual maturity.

00:21:12.579 --> 00:21:14.679
And we'll deal with that in our last point this morning.

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:17.279
But we're to grow and he says here

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:19.979
that these individuals that he's writing to,

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:23.179
we know two things based upon the Scriptures.

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:26.179
Number one, we know that they're saved people.

00:21:26.179 --> 00:21:27.979
Because we know that the Bible tells us

00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:29.979
in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse number 14,

00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:33.579
the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:37.379
Neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:40.279
And I missed the middle section of that verse of Scripture.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.079
And when he says this,

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:43.179
but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,

00:21:43.179 --> 00:21:46.579
for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them.

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:49.279
Why? Because they are spiritually discerned.

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:52.579
And the reality is that we know that as he is saying,

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:54.279
I have many things to say,

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.579
and they're hard to be uttered.

00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:57.579
Why? Because you're dull of hearing.

00:21:57.579 --> 00:22:00.379
And for when the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:22:00.379 --> 00:22:01.779
you have need that one teach you.

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.379
He's not writing to lost people.

00:22:03.379 --> 00:22:05.379
He's writing to saved people.

00:22:05.379 --> 00:22:08.079
Because the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:09.679
They're foolishness unto him.

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:12.579
What does the natural man, the unregenerate man,

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:14.579
what does he need? He needs the Gospel.

00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:16.979
The first aspect of the Great Commission.

00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:21.979
That's what needs to be given to that group of people.

00:22:21.979 --> 00:22:24.479
Those that are unsure of their salvation.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:27.579
They've never trusted Christ as their personal Savior.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:31.279
What do we teach them? We teach them the Gospel.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:33.179
And then they get saved.

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:34.879
And then they get baptized.

00:22:34.879 --> 00:22:37.579
And then we teach them to observe all things,

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:39.579
whatsoever I have commanded you,

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:41.379
that process of discipleship.

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:44.779
And so we understand as we look at the passage of Scripture here,

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:47.979
that the writer is not writing to lost people.

00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:52.479
He's writing to saved people that are just immature spiritually.

00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:54.779
Why? Because they're dull of hearing.

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:59.979
Notice, as we would consider this truth in this passage of Scripture,

00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:01.979
we would say this, unfortunately,

00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:06.579
that this was, and in some cases continues to be,

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:09.579
a problem within the church.

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:12.079
And it's an unfortunate reality

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.879
that we would find as we come to the passage of Scripture,

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:17.879
but we'd understand that the writer of Hebrews

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:21.279
is not seeking to destroy these individuals.

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.879
I believe that he's seeking to confront them

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:26.679
with their lack of spiritual growth

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:30.979
and to encourage them to grow.

00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:35.479
Think about this. Turn back, if you will, to Acts chapter 28.

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:40.579
The Apostle Paul is entertaining a group of people here.

00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:44.479
In Acts chapter 28, it's the last chapter of the book,

00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:48.379
and we find that God is giving us some information.

00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:50.879
Paul, of course, would arrive in Rome,

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:53.579
and there's some interaction that is taking place.

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:57.679
And we begin looking at the passage in verse number 22.

00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:58.379
The Bible says,

00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:01.279
But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest.

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:05.679
First, concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:07.379
And when they had appointed him a day,

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:11.279
there came many to him into his lodging.

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:13.879
So this group of people, Paul's in Rome,

00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:16.479
he's under house arrest, and they come to where he is.

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:19.179
They appointed a day, according to verse number 23.

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:21.679
And it says there in verse number 23,

00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:27.179
To whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:29.179
persuading them concerning Jesus,

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:31.379
both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets,

00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:33.679
from morning till evening.

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:36.379
And some believed the things which were spoken,

00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:39.079
and some believed not.

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.879
And when they agreed not among themselves,

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.279
they departed after that.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:44.679
Paul had spoken one word, and he says this.

00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:45.979
It's a quote from Isaiah.

00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:51.179
Well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:52.979
saying, Go unto this people and say,

00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:55.479
Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand,

00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:57.879
and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.

00:24:57.879 --> 00:24:59.379
This is in Isaiah 6.

00:24:59.379 --> 00:25:02.479
You remember the context of Isaiah 6.

00:25:02.479 --> 00:25:04.879
It's in that passage of Scripture that the Bible tells us

00:25:04.879 --> 00:25:07.679
that it was in the year that King Uzziah died.

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:12.479
In Isaiah, he sees that vision of God high, holy, and lifted up.

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:14.779
And his train did fill the temple.

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.979
And he hears the Lord say,

00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:19.479
Whom shall I send and who will go for me?

00:25:19.479 --> 00:25:21.979
And Isaiah volunteers, Hear him, I, send me.

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:25.179
And we find that God then gives him the direction

00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:27.979
and the instruction for that ministry

00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:29.379
that he had volunteered for.

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:34.579
And we find that this is a portion of that passage of Scripture.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:35.779
He says in v. 27,

00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:38.179
For the heart of this people is waxed gross,

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:41.379
and their ears are dull of hearing,

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:43.079
and their eyes have they closed,

00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:45.079
lest they should see with their eyes

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:46.679
and hear with their ears,

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:47.879
and understand with their heart,

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:48.879
and should be converted,

00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:50.379
and I should heal them.

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:52.879
These are people that of course,

00:25:52.879 --> 00:25:54.879
as we would look within the context

00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:56.879
that he's preaching the Gospel to them,

00:25:56.879 --> 00:25:59.379
and there were some that believed according to v. 24,

00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:02.279
but there were some that believed not.

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:06.579
And he says that this is like that which Isaiah had prophesied

00:26:06.579 --> 00:26:09.079
with regard to the heart of the people,

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:11.279
and rejecting that which is given.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.379
And he says that they were dull of hearing.

00:26:13.379 --> 00:26:16.079
We understand that that can be the case for lost people,

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:18.779
just as it is appointed here in Hebrews 5

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:20.079
for those that are Christians,

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.479
those that have been born again,

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:24.379
that immaturity of the saints.

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:27.379
Notice in 1 Corinthians 3,

00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:30.679
Paul dealt with this issue with the believers in Corinth,

00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:32.979
and about a year and a half ago,

00:26:32.979 --> 00:26:34.179
maybe a little longer now,

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:35.979
we studied through the book of 1 Corinthians

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:37.979
in our adult Sunday school class,

00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:39.479
and as we studied through the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:41.479
we made note on many occasion

00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:44.979
that the church at Corinth was not a model church.

00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:47.779
The church in Corinth, in fact, had many problems.

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:52.979
We find that this is dealt with in v. 1 of this section,

00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:56.579
and it's dealt with in various portions of 1 Corinthians,

00:26:56.579 --> 00:26:58.179
but what I want to highlight to you this morning

00:26:58.179 --> 00:27:00.779
is 1 Corinthians 3, verses 1-3,

00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:02.079
where the Bible says this.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.479
Notice what Paul says to them.

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:07.279
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:12.779
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:17.579
even as unto babes in Christ.

00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:21.779
I have fed you with milk and not with meat.

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:23.779
For hitherto, notice what he says,

00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:26.379
ye were not able to bear it,

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:29.479
neither yet now are ye able.

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:31.879
There was a problem of spiritual immaturity

00:27:31.879 --> 00:27:33.579
even in the church in Corinth,

00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:35.079
and Paul says there are some things

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:36.179
that I wanted to teach you,

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:37.979
some things I wanted to speak unto you,

00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:40.379
but I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,

00:27:40.379 --> 00:27:41.679
but as unto carnal,

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.479
even as babes in Christ.

00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:44.779
I fed you with milk,

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:48.079
but I could not feed you with the meat of the Word of God.

00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:50.179
Why? Because you were carnal,

00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:51.679
and you were not able to bear it,

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:55.779
and still, you're not able to bear it.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.079
He says this in v. 3,

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:59.479
for ye are yet carnal,

00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:01.679
whereas there is among you envying

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.579
and strife and divisions.

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:05.179
Are ye not carnal?

00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:06.679
And walk as men.

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:08.779
The evidence of their spiritual immaturity,

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:10.779
the evidence was their carnality.

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:13.379
It was their envying and their strife

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:14.779
and their division.

00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:16.679
We find that Paul would then go into

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:19.379
an exposition of dealing with their carnality

00:28:19.379 --> 00:28:21.179
where they were in the church in Corinth

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:22.679
and there were a group of people saying,

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:25.879
I'm of Apollos, I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas,

00:28:25.879 --> 00:28:29.179
and they were all divided amongst themselves.

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:32.380
And Paul says that you're carnal.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.880
You've not matured spiritually.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.380
As we look in our text back in Hebrews 5,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.079
we examine this warning passage.

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:46.380
We find that it's the imparting of spiritual truth.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.779
The writer says we have many things to say.

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:52.380
It's hard to be uttered. Why?

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.380
Seeing that you're dull of hearing.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.179
We find the imparting of spiritual truth,

00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:59.880
the immaturity of the saints

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.380
was the result of the fact

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.880
that they were dull of hearing.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.079
They had need that one teach them again

00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:07.479
the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.880
They were in need of milk.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.679
They were unskillful as we see in v. 13,

00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:15.179
for everyone that useth milk is unskillful

00:29:15.179 --> 00:29:16.779
in the word of righteousness,

00:29:16.779 --> 00:29:18.479
for he is a babe.

00:29:18.479 --> 00:29:20.479
The immaturity of the saints.

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:21.779
Notice finally this morning,

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:23.279
number 3, if you're taking notes,

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:26.679
the importance of spiritual growth.

00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:29.979
The importance of spiritual growth.

00:29:29.979 --> 00:29:32.179
There's a comparison that is given to us here

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:33.579
in an analogy, if you will.

00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:36.679
We saw it in 1 Corinthians 3 as well.

00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:40.079
But we find here that there's this comparison

00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:41.179
that is made,

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.380
and I believe that it's a physical comparison.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.679
It is a truth that we could relate to

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:48.679
similar to how the Lord Jesus Christ

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:50.979
would use parables in His teaching.

00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:52.479
And He would use these parables

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:53.279
as He would teach

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.979
so that they would understand

00:29:54.979 --> 00:29:56.279
the spiritual truth.

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:59.479
He was using this teaching of...

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:04.519
nature to drive home a spiritual truth, and we see that here in Hebrews 5, just

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:09.279
as we did in 1st Corinthians 3, and he uses this subject and he uses the

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:17.079
the phraseologies or the items of milk and meat. Now we understand the truth of

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:23.719
physical maturity. Physical maturity is expected, right? There are charts that

00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:28.599
they have at the doctor's offices for all of those wellness checkups for those

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:33.079
of us that remember when our children were young, and maybe some that are still

00:30:33.079 --> 00:30:36.399
dealing with some of those things where you're taking your children for wellness

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:41.679
checkups. We had the opportunity to see our newest niece yesterday, and man, she's

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:45.999
just like six pounds and three or four ounces, just a tiny little baby girl, and

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:50.519
she's doing well, and there was comment made about, well, at her checkup on

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:57.119
Thursday, and there are certain charts and there are expectations of physical

00:30:57.159 --> 00:31:02.399
maturity. Not only when it comes to weight and height, but when it comes to

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:06.879
the motor skills, there's a certain age in which you expect that the babies are

00:31:06.879 --> 00:31:10.119
gonna start rolling over, they're gonna start crawling, they're gonna start

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:16.119
walking, and then it gets real, amen? But the reality is that there is the

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:24.079
expectation of physical maturity. Becky has been showing pictures and speaking

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:29.319
about some of the progress of Sophie and some of her maturity and what she's

00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:36.439
doing as she's growing and rolling over and sitting up and various things. It's

00:31:36.439 --> 00:31:42.959
expected. In like manner, spiritual maturity should be evident, should be

00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:48.039
expected. Notice what is said in the passage of Scripture here in verse

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:52.359
number 12. We think about the importance of spiritual growth. He says this at the

00:31:52.359 --> 00:32:00.159
beginning of the verse, "...for when? For the time ye ought to be teachers." What does

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:03.119
that reveal to us? Well, I've said a couple of things already. We understand

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:06.719
that he's not speaking about a lost person, he's not speaking about the

00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:10.879
natural man. We've understood that from 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14, but we also

00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:14.679
understand that as he's speaking to these saved individuals, he's not

00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:20.119
speaking to new converts. He's not speaking to those that should have a

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:26.239
milk diet, that should have the basics of the Word of God. The basics are

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:30.999
important, and by the way, it's good for us to review the basics on a regular

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:37.999
basis as God's people, but we ought to go on to spiritual maturity. There ought to

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:42.679
be this spiritual growth that is evident in the life of a believer, and we

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:46.079
find that the importance of spiritual growth is given to us in the passage of

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:49.399
Scripture. These individuals that are being addressed in Hebrews chapter

00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:56.799
5, they had been saved long enough to go on to spiritual maturity. In 1 Peter 2

00:32:56.799 --> 00:33:01.319
and verse number 2, the Bible says, "...as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of

00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:09.599
the Word that ye may grow thereby." There's that natural desire as a believer, there

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:13.559
should be a natural desire for the things of the Word of God. I want to grow.

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:20.279
"...as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby."

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:25.479
We find that that's in 1 Peter 2 and verse number 2. In 2 Peter 3 and

00:33:25.479 --> 00:33:30.319
verse number 18, Peter ends this epistle by saying, "...but grow in grace and in the

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:36.399
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to him be glory both now and

00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:42.199
forever. Amen." The importance of spiritual growth, we find it really dealt with

00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:46.559
throughout the Word of God. We find it's interesting in verse number 1 of chapter

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:50.639
6, he says, "...therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,"

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:55.919
notice what he says, "...let us go on unto perfection." We'll deal with this passage

00:33:55.919 --> 00:34:01.439
next week, but we find this idea of letting us go on, go on to spiritual

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:06.119
maturity, the importance of spiritual growth. We see in verse number 14, he says,

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:12.599
"...but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:19.319
of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil." It's

00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:25.319
interesting, you would not feed yesterday when Ayla was there, and she's just, I

00:34:25.319 --> 00:34:29.959
guess, tomorrow she'll be two weeks old. We had meat for lunch, but we didn't feed

00:34:29.959 --> 00:34:35.919
her any meat. It would have been terribly irresponsible to feed meat to that

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:41.239
two-week-old baby. Number one, she doesn't have teeth to chew the meat. Number two,

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:47.639
she does not have the ability to digest the meat. It could cause serious problems. So we

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:53.519
did not give her meat. No, we ate meat and she drank a bottle. That's what was

00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:57.359
appropriate for her. By the way, I'm thankful that I didn't have a bottle of

00:34:57.359 --> 00:35:04.279
milk that was set at my place. I like the meat, you know? And the reality is he's

00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:09.079
using this physical analogy to drive home this spiritual point. He's saying

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:14.879
that, yes, the milk is important. You can't skip the milk. You can't. Because as

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:18.439
newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the words that you may grow thereby. You

00:35:18.439 --> 00:35:23.359
need the milk, and it's good to go back, and even as adults we still have milk in

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:28.519
our diet, but our diet as adults, physically speaking, doesn't consist

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:37.239
only of milk. And we find that there's this analogy of strong meat, and it says

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:42.959
that it belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:50.359
have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. I've said throughout

00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:56.839
the years that we're as close to God as we want to be. We've grown in our

00:35:56.919 --> 00:36:02.679
spiritual life as much as we really want to. The reality is that physically

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:09.359
speaking, there's a process of maturity. And there are times in which young

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:14.479
people, and maybe even their parents, they want children to go beyond what

00:36:14.479 --> 00:36:21.479
physically they should be doing because of their desire to see them advance. We

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:26.959
think about it from a spiritual aspect, that truth of spiritual growth is

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:31.399
something that is available to every child of God. We can be as close to God

00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:35.239
as we want to be. We can grow as quickly as we want to grow. And our spiritual

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:41.479
growth is directly linked to our relationship to God's Word, because this

00:36:41.479 --> 00:36:46.039
is what causes growth in the life of believer. Notice what he says with regard

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:49.639
to this spiritual growth, and really the impact of this spiritual growth, or the

00:36:49.639 --> 00:36:55.119
result of it. It says, even those, at the end of verse 14, who by reason of use, this

00:36:55.119 --> 00:37:00.159
is that spiritual maturity, the spiritual growth, it says they have their senses

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:07.159
exercised to discern both good and evil. As we grow spiritually, God gives us the

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:13.479
ability to discern between good and evil. And oh how we need discernment. There are

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:19.599
times in which we've observed a lack of discernment amongst the people of God.

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:24.439
There are times perhaps in our own lives, if we'd be honest, that we've lacked

00:37:24.439 --> 00:37:29.599
that spiritual maturity, that spiritual growth, and maybe we're not pressing on,

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:34.519
maybe we're not going on as we should. Maybe things have gotten kind of stale,

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:38.919
if you will. Maybe in certain regards we've gotten to the place where we'd say,

00:37:38.919 --> 00:37:46.439
you know, I've been dull of hearing. It's not that I don't love God, it's not that

00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:54.279
I don't want to read the Bible. I've just kind of gotten stale, if you will. No, no,

00:37:54.279 --> 00:37:58.999
that we would go on, that we'd understand this warning passage, that we'd

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:03.279
understand that God has so much for us, and that yes, it's good to be saved, and

00:38:03.279 --> 00:38:08.119
it's good to know the truth of the crucifixion, and the life of Christ,

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:11.199
His crucifixion, His burial, His resurrection, those are wonderful things,

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:16.919
but we need to go on to spiritual maturity, allowing the Lord to have His

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:21.519
work in our lives that He desires to have. In Hebrews 13 and verses 20 and 21,

00:38:21.519 --> 00:38:27.799
when the Bible speaks about the Great Shepherd, the Lord Jesus

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:33.159
Christ in that role, we dealt with this during one of our sessions with our

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:36.639
pandemic, and one of the Bible studies that we had one of those evenings

00:38:36.639 --> 00:38:40.760
dealing with the Lord as our Shepherd, and here the Great Shepherd is the term

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.119
that is given to Him. We found that He is the Good Shepherd, the Great Shepherd,

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:47.440
and the Chief Shepherd, and here the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13 and verse

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.239
20, now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that

00:38:52.239 --> 00:38:55.760
Great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant, notice

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:03.639
in verse 21, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you

00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:09.519
that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory

00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:15.959
forever and ever, amen. This is the work that God wants to do in us, and that He

00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:21.479
would make us perfect, that word means complete, in every good work to do His

00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:26.119
will. We find that He spoke about there, as we mentioned already in verse number

00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:32.119
1 of chapter 6, let us go on unto perfection, let us go on to spiritual

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:38.079
maturity, if you will, and here the warning is given. What an appropriate

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:44.079
warning that is given by the author of Hebrews, of course the the Lord Himself,

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:49.479
all scripture is given by inspiration of God, it's God's Word, and God knew where

00:39:49.479 --> 00:39:53.679
they were spiritually, and He knew that they needed this warning, see because

00:39:53.679 --> 00:40:00.799
there were many things to say. There was instruction that was

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:03.499
needed to be given,

00:40:03.499 --> 00:40:07.059
but it was hard to be uttered because they were dull of hearing.

00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:11.439
And so this warning was given to bring them to a place of repentance,

00:40:11.439 --> 00:40:14.239
to bring them to a place where they would deal with that,

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:15.359
and that they would go on,

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:19.659
and then they would be ready to receive the instruction.

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:28.659
I'm mindful of the way in which the Apostle Paul speaks highly of the Bereans.

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:32.659
In closing, turn to Acts 17, if you will.

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:35.459
It's interesting as we would look at what takes place here,

00:40:35.459 --> 00:40:37.539
and really in Acts chapter number 17,

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:42.539
we find that they arrive in Thessalonica and the work is given there,

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:45.539
and they're not there for a very lengthy period of time

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:48.539
as we've mentioned with many of these places

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:52.839
in which the Apostle Paul was able to go during his missionary journeys.

00:40:52.839 --> 00:40:55.379
There was much opposition and difficulty,

00:40:55.379 --> 00:40:57.259
and as much as we can tell,

00:40:57.259 --> 00:41:00.559
they were there just for a very short period of time, just a few weeks,

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:02.799
and they reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:06.339
and we find that the Bible tells us,

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:08.719
to just catch it in context,

00:41:08.719 --> 00:41:11.799
that there were folks that believed, there were some that believed not.

00:41:11.799 --> 00:41:13.839
We see that in verse number 4, and some of them believed,

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.139
and then in verse number 5,

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.599
but the Jews which believed not moved with envy,

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:20.799
and here comes the difficulties, the opposition.

00:41:20.799 --> 00:41:22.419
It says in verse number 6,

00:41:22.419 --> 00:41:23.839
And when they found them not,

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:26.719
they drew Jason and certain brethren under the rulers of the city,

00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:30.459
crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.

00:41:30.459 --> 00:41:32.539
And through a series of events,

00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:34.879
we find that the brethren, in verse number 10,

00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:40.919
immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea.

00:41:40.919 --> 00:41:41.619
And it says,

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:45.419
Who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews,

00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:47.999
these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,

00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:51.999
and that they received the word with all readiness of mind,

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:55.279
and searched the Scriptures daily,

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:58.959
whether those things were so.

00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:01.079
When Paul and Silas went to Berea,

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:03.199
and they went into the synagogue of the Jews,

00:42:03.199 --> 00:42:05.619
he's speaking about these Jews in the synagogue,

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:08.779
that they were more noble than those in Thessalonica,

00:42:08.779 --> 00:42:09.959
for two reasons.

00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:15.239
Number one, they received the word with all readiness of mind.

00:42:15.239 --> 00:42:19.239
Now think about the difference, the contrast, if you will,

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:23.779
between these that received the word with readiness of mind,

00:42:23.779 --> 00:42:26.159
versus those that are being addressed in Hebrews 5,

00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:30.019
that were said to be dull of hearing.

00:42:30.019 --> 00:42:31.899
He says, you received it with readiness of mind,

00:42:31.899 --> 00:42:37.159
and you searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:39.699
Now we know that when Paul went to Thessalonica,

00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:43.059
that there were some that believed according to verse number 4,

00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:45.439
and they consorted with Paul and Silas,

00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:47.359
and of the devout Greeks, a great multitude,

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:48.939
and of the chief women, not a few,

00:42:48.979 --> 00:42:51.899
but then the Jews, which believed not, moved with envy.

00:42:51.899 --> 00:42:54.179
And that's the comparison that Paul is making here,

00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:56.939
for we know that when he writes to the church in Thessalonica,

00:42:56.939 --> 00:42:59.479
when he's writing to those that believe,

00:42:59.479 --> 00:43:01.019
that are mentioned in verse number 4,

00:43:01.019 --> 00:43:05.219
that he writes to these folks in 1 Thessalonians 2,

00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:09.299
and he commends them for the fact that they received the word of God,

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:12.179
which he heard of us, he received it, not as the word of men,

00:43:12.179 --> 00:43:14.559
but as it is in truth, the word of God.

00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:17.959
Now notice, in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 13,

00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:19.379
it ends like this,

00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:26.379
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:43:26.379 --> 00:43:30.599
Why did Paul tell Timothy, preach the word?

00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:36.519
We started a series in the book of Titus in our adult Sunday school,

00:43:36.519 --> 00:43:39.479
and we've only gotten a few weeks into our series,

00:43:39.479 --> 00:43:43.879
and that's been postponed until we're able to meet together again.

00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:47.639
But as we dealt with the subject of the book of Titus,

00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:52.039
we've given Grounded and Settled as our title for that series,

00:43:52.039 --> 00:43:56.479
and the importance of being spiritually mature,

00:43:56.479 --> 00:43:59.639
and the importance of that spiritual growth in our lives.

00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:03.899
And we've spoken of the fact that there was the truth that was given to us

00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:11.079
with regard to those that were not going to endure sound doctrine.

00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:16.079
Those that would be able to, as Titus would go forth,

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:18.479
and he would set in order the things that were wanting,

00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:20.679
and then ordain elders in every city,

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:24.679
that they were going to pick men in the qualifications that were given,

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:27.039
and one of them was that by sound doctrine,

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.919
they were to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:34.239
And we spoke about the importance of sound doctrine.

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:38.799
Paul told Timothy to preach the word.

00:44:38.799 --> 00:44:43.559
It's interesting, as we would understand why he tells Timothy to preach the word,

00:44:43.559 --> 00:44:51.159
it's because of the nature, the fact that the word of God is profitable,

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:55.479
and we see that in verse number 16 of 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

00:44:55.479 --> 00:44:55.879
when he says,

00:44:55.879 --> 00:44:59.519
All scripture is given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine,

00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:02.519
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:05.039
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:06.799
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:45:06.799 --> 00:45:10.319
And then the charge is given in verse number 1 of chapter 4,

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:12.879
and it continues through, really, verse number 5,

00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:15.479
but he tells them to preach the word.

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:16.639
Why?

00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:21.559
Because the word is going to benefit, it's profitable,

00:45:21.559 --> 00:45:24.879
and it's going to help individuals come to that place of spiritual growth,

00:45:24.879 --> 00:45:26.639
of spiritual maturity.

00:45:26.639 --> 00:45:31.319
And so as we look at the warning of Hebrews chapter number 5, verses 11 through 14,

00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:34.359
we find, first of all, the imparting of spiritual truth.

00:45:34.359 --> 00:45:36.879
We have many things to say.

00:45:36.879 --> 00:45:40.559
The desire of the spiritual leader to impart spiritual truth,

00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:43.879
to fulfill the entirety of the Great Commission,

00:45:43.879 --> 00:45:47.639
to preach the gospel, to see people follow the Lord in believer's baptism,

00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:51.879
but then to teach them all things whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:54.440
We see the immaturity of the saints.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:00.359
It says that these things that he had to say, many things that he had to say,

00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:01.919
that they were hard to be uttered.

00:46:01.919 --> 00:46:02.279
Why?

00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:07.079
Because by saying you're dull of hearing, the immaturity of the saints.

00:46:07.079 --> 00:46:09.679
It was a problem, but it was a problem that needed to be addressed.

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:13.519
It was a problem that needed to be resolved.

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:18.159
So that he then highlights for them the importance of spiritual growth.

00:46:18.159 --> 00:46:23.519
Oh, that we would determine in our lives that we're concerned about our spiritual growth.

00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:26.559
See, in our society today, obviously things are different today

00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:29.679
than they have been in recent years,

00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:35.119
but there's such a focus on so many things from a developmental perspective.

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:40.440
There's much information that's given in many businesses that make lots of money,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.239
and I know they're closed down right now because of the pandemic,

00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:47.720
but just health centers and fitness centers.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.440
The importance of focusing on the physical health or the physical growth.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.159
There's a truth.

00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:58.000
The Bible tells us that bodily exercise profiteth little.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.119
It's an interesting verse of scripture, is it not?

00:47:00.119 --> 00:47:02.679
Bodily exercise profiteth little.

00:47:02.679 --> 00:47:04.519
There's a benefit to it.

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:07.919
But oh, sometimes what happens is we're out of balance.

00:47:07.919 --> 00:47:13.799
We focus so much on the physical that we forget to focus on the spiritual.

00:47:13.799 --> 00:47:15.359
The spiritual growth.

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.599
The spiritual maturity.

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:22.440
And the writer of Hebrews says there's an importance of spiritual growth.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.279
Oh, that we would go on to spiritual maturity.

00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:27.639
That we would be able to have that strong meat.

00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:33.079
That we would have the ability to discern between both good and evil.

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:35.079
The warning is given.

00:47:35.079 --> 00:47:38.839
It must be received, and they must seek to resolve the problem

00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:42.639
so that they could then receive that which is going to be given.

00:47:42.639 --> 00:47:45.919
We'll continue with the warning in chapter number six in our next couple of weeks

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:48.279
as we look through the passage of scripture,

00:47:48.279 --> 00:47:50.079
and then eventually get to chapter number seven.

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:54.399
We deal with that which the writer is saying we have many things to say.

00:47:54.399 --> 00:47:57.559
But we're dull of hearing, and that needed to be addressed.

00:47:57.559 --> 00:47:58.559
Let us pray.

00:47:58.559 --> 00:47:59.559
Father, we love you this morning.

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:00.559
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:03.919
Lord, I pray this morning that as we look at this warning

00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:08.440
that is given to the recipients of the book of Hebrews,

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.279
we find that it's been preserved for us.

00:48:11.279 --> 00:48:14.279
The warnings have gotten more severe.

00:48:14.279 --> 00:48:17.199
Listen up in chapter two.

00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:21.279
Hear and believe there in chapter number three and four.

00:48:21.279 --> 00:48:25.679
And now we come to this latter portion of chapter five,

00:48:25.679 --> 00:48:29.919
and we see that they're told that they're dull of hearing.

00:48:29.919 --> 00:48:35.000
God, I pray that it would not be said of any of us that we are dull of hearing,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.839
but I also pray that we would not be deceived.

00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:46.239
Lord, that if there's one amongst us, one that's watching the live stream,

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:48.479
the Holy Spirit of God would prick our hearts

00:48:48.479 --> 00:48:52.359
and we would be honest in our evaluation.

00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:55.080
We've often spoken of the truth from 1 Corinthians 11,

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.599
let a man examine himself.

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:01.399
We've often spoken about the importance of that self-examination

00:49:01.399 --> 00:49:05.039
being done in honesty and in humility.

00:49:05.039 --> 00:49:08.799
Self-deception is the greatest level of deception.

00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:11.799
And it's our prayer that we would not be self-deceived.

00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:14.399
And Lord, if we would be guilty of being dull of hearing,

00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:18.799
would you help us to get that resolved?

00:49:18.799 --> 00:49:25.839
Help us to not be categorized as those that are immature spiritually.

00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:29.479
Father, help us to understand the importance of spiritual growth,

00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:35.279
that we would purpose in our lives to spend more time with you and your word,

00:49:35.279 --> 00:49:39.320
seeking specifically to grow and to develop in our walk with thee,

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.799
that we'd allow you to have your will and way in our lives,

00:49:42.799 --> 00:49:47.919
that we would understand the importance of the spiritual.

00:49:47.919 --> 00:49:49.760
I pray, God, that you would bless,

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.440
the Holy Spirit of God would work as only he can.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.519
I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

00:49:55.519 --> 00:49:58.440
they do not have 100% assurance that if they were to die today,

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.519
that heaven's their home.

00:49:59.519 --> 00:50:00.839
Lord, I pray,

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:05.739
Today, they would trust Christ as their Lord and Savior.

00:50:05.739 --> 00:50:09.499
They would have that assurance from Your Word that heaven is their home, not because of

00:50:09.499 --> 00:50:15.019
any work that they've done, not because of any religious observance that they've held

00:50:15.019 --> 00:50:19.879
to, because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary.

00:50:19.879 --> 00:50:23.179
We ask now in these few moments of invitation that You would have Your will and way in our

00:50:23.179 --> 00:50:27.859
lives, and we'll thank You for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
