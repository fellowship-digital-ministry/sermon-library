1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
passage of scripture. I hope that as we examine this portion of scripture this

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,279
morning that we would be challenged. I trust that we'd be encouraged as we look

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,000
at this familiar passage, but also that God would challenge us. I'm mindful of

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,079
some New Testament truth. If you look in, you're there in Daniel, but I consider

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,079
the truth with regard to the Apostle Paul speaking to the church in Ephesus.

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,280
What's funny, Steve? You're good? Okay, I thought something, Jim's taking his thing

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,600
like this, so I didn't know if something was going on behind me. And in Ephesians, of

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,880
course, the Apostle Paul is encouraging the believers in Ephesus with regard to

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,720
their walk with God. Of course, the foundation in the first few chapters is

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,680
established with regard to their relationship to God through the Lord

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,040
Jesus Christ, and then he addresses their walk, and he comes to the final chapter

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,720
in the book of Ephesians, and as he gets to the latter part of that chapter, he

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,080
begins to talk about the spiritual warfare in which were engaged. And in so

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,759
doing, he begins to challenge the believers in Ephesus to stand, and he

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,839
tells them that they are to be strong in the power of the Lord, and we find that

16
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:12,120
as we would examine and consider the admonition, if you will, that the Apostle

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,959
Paul gives to the church at Ephesus and to the believers there, and he tells them

18
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,480
not only be strong in the power of the Lord, but he tells them to put on the

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,559
whole armor of God, and he says this, that you may be able to stand against

20
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:31,160
the wiles of the devil. He then tells them we're not engaged in some sort of

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,959
wrestling match, some sort of fleshly carnal battle. No, it's a spiritual battle

22
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,559
in which we are engaged in. And we begin to think about the, really, the admonition

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,319
that Paul gives to these believers as he's instructing them, and I find this

24
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:54,519
morning that each generation will face unique pressures to bow or to conform to

25
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,440
the current ideologies. We find that we're living in a particular era in

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,160
which we, as this generation, we are facing certain pressures to bow, to

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,080
conform to the ideologies that exist, and we find that each generation is going to

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
face such circumstances. The believers that Paul is referencing and ministering

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,320
to in Ephesus, they had their own set of circumstances that they faced, and they

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,119
had to stand in the power of God, and they had to be willing to yield

31
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:31,960
themselves to God. They had to be willing to walk in the Spirit so that they

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,279
would not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and we find that for the passage of

33
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,639
Scripture that we're going to look at this morning in Daniel 3, we find that

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,399
these three Hebrew children that we often are familiar with, Shadrach,

35
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:51,360
Meshach, and Abednego, these fellas, they faced unique circumstances with regard

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,600
to the pressures of their day, and we find that they were willing to stand. If

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,160
you've already looked at the bulletin on the back, the title for the message this

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,880
morning is really a question, and the question is this, are you willing to

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,240
stand? Am I willing to stand? Again, each generation is going to have its

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,160
opportunity to face the pressures and the ideologies that exist within that

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,559
particular society and culture, and the question is whether or not the people of

42
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:28,080
God will stand. We find that as we look at a passage like Daniel 3, we rejoice

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,399
greatly in understanding what takes place, and we're familiar with the

44
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:35,759
passage of Scripture, and we say, man, this is wonderful, look at how God worked,

45
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,440
look at what God did, but it's because there were some people of God that

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,080
stood, that were willing to take a stand no matter what the pressures were,

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,759
no matter what the consequences were that they would face, they were willing

48
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,179
to take a stand, and the question is we look through history, not only biblical

49
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:58,839
history, but we look at modern history and look at the church history through

50
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:04,639
the ages, and you can find individuals and groups of people that stood for

51
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:12,520
truth, and I wonder this morning, I wonder in our generation who among us would be

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,299
written about that we were willing to stand, that we might encourage a future

53
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,519
generation in like fashion as we have been encouraged by those who have gone

54
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:29,320
before us that were willing to take a stand. As we notice in our passage of

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Scripture here in Daniel 3, let me just read some verses, we'll get into

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,600
the message. I'm gonna try to look at all 30 verses, and notice in verse number

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,359
one the Bible says this, Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose

58
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:48,359
height was three square cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits. He set it up

59
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:53,480
in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. We understand that Nebuchadnezzar

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,320
is the king of the Babylonian Empire, we understand that he has great power, we

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,119
find that as you look at the history with regard to this kingdom and you'd

62
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:07,160
understand the power in which this man had when he's going to put up this image

63
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,359
of gold, this 90-foot image, and he's going to give some requirements that

64
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:15,320
we'll look at in just a few moments, you understand that he had power to make

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,119
happen what he said would happen. And as we look at the passage of Scripture

66
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:25,040
and we consider the question, are you willing to stand? I want us to consider a

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,279
few things. Number one, consider with me the circumstances these men faced.

68
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,480
Consider the circumstances they faced. Now admittedly, right from the beginning

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,200
this morning, we understand that the circumstances that are faced in Daniel

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,160
3 are different than the circumstances that you will face, they're different

71
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
than the circumstances that I will face, they're different than the circumstances

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,480
that Paul faced and the believers in Ephesus faced, but each generation is

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,399
going to have a set of circumstances, some ideologies that are in opposition

74
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:02,679
to God's Word that we're gonna face. And here in Daniel 3, we find as we've read

75
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:07,200
in verse number one that this golden image is set up and in verse 2 it says

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,200
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together, notice, the princes, the

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,399
governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the

78
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,600
sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come. For what? They were

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,880
gonna have this dedication, it says, to come to the dedication of the image

80
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,600
which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Then, in response to this edict, if you

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
will, that was made, it says the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges,

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,839
the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the

83
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,480
provinces were gathered together under the dedication of the image that

84
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,959
Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that

85
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,880
Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then, and Harold cried aloud, to you, notice, it is

86
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,600
commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what time you hear the sound of

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,079
the cornet, flute, harp, samba, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you

88
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,799
fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.

89
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:22,279
Now, here's where it gets complicated for these three Hebrew children. We find that

90
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,959
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they've already been taken into Babylon. Of

91
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,880
course, Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians would conquer Judah, and we

92
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,200
find that these fellows, along with Daniel, they were in captivity. They're

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,000
there in Babylon. If you read the first couple of chapters, you see in which the

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,480
way in which they were sought to be indoctrinated. In chapter number one, you

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,040
read about the indoctrination program that the Babylonians had for those that

96
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,000
they would bring in, and you find that here, this Harold cries, listen, the

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,920
instruction, the command was clear. It was not ambiguous whatsoever, but the command

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,320
violated a greater command, and that was a command that God had given. And we find

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,600
that as here, these men would hear this instruction, as this Harold would cry

100
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,000
aloud and say, here's what is required of you. You're gonna hear the music play, and

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,040
when that happens, you fall down and worship. Worship an image? Yes, fall down

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,400
and worship. And we find that as the music would play, as they would prepare

103
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,159
for this, that not only was the command known, but the consequences were known. We

104
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,760
find that in verse number six, the Bible says, and whoso falleth not down and

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,400
worshipeth shall the same hour be cast in the midst of a burning, fiery furnace.

106
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,840
The stakes were high. The situation, the circumstances that they faced were

107
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,000
serious. We find that the stakes are high. They understand the command that is

108
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,280
given. Again, this command is not ambiguous. It's extremely clear. We've

109
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,479
created this image. We've set up this golden image, and we're gonna have some

110
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:19,159
musicians play some music, and you're going to bow and worship. And if not, in

111
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:26,039
the same hour, the burning, fiery furnace. Can you imagine the predicament that

112
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,719
these men are in? Can you imagine as they're in this situation, and we find

113
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,400
that just as we look at the circumstances, we find that these

114
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,320
pressures that they faced, again, different than the pressures that we

115
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,880
would face. We understand that the pressures are varied, but we would

116
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,679
understand also that they're certain. We will face pressures. We are facing

117
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,880
pressures. And we find that as we look here at this passage of Scripture that

118
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,000
says in verse number 7,

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
"...therefore at that time when all the people..."

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,119
heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sakhba, psaltery, and all kinds of music,

121
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:15,640
notice the next three words, all the people, the nations and the languages

122
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,040
fell down and worshipped. What did they do? They worshipped the golden image that

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,479
Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Whether it was out of this, of course, we

124
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:31,559
understand as you'd look at the Babylonian Empire and look at their

125
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,020
culture and society, an idolatrous people, a people that served a

126
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,080
multiplicity of gods, and we find that there's some that would be bowing

127
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,240
down in worship because it was just custom in their culture. There are others

128
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,200
no doubt that did this out of fear. They understood the circumstances, they

129
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,840
understood the consequences, and they said, I'm not going to a burning fiery

130
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,959
furnace. I understand that Nebuchadnezzar has the power to fulfill that which he

131
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:07,879
said would be the consequence. These people bow down and they worship, but in

132
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,440
verses 8 through 12 we are introduced to people that we have become familiar with

133
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,279
as New Testament believers, to these three Hebrew children that were willing

134
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,360
to stand. The Bible says in verse number 8,

135
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,959
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews. They

136
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,959
spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever! Thou, O king, hast

137
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,400
made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,

138
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,040
sakhba, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and

139
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
worship the golden image. And whoso falleth not down and worshipeth that he

140
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,199
should be cast in the midst of a burning fiery furnace. They knew what

141
00:11:54,199 --> 00:12:00,360
had been commanded. They repeated to the king the edict that he had put forth, and

142
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,080
they say, There are certain Jews, in verse number 12, whom thou hast set over the

143
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,000
affairs of the province of Babylon. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men,

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,119
O king, have not regarded thee. They serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden

145
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:26,080
image which thou hast set up. And we ought to say, Amen! They took a stand. And we

146
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,119
find that the stand is taken in verse number 12. These certain, these Jews are

147
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:36,199
accused by these that are mentioned in verse number 8, these Chaldeans that come

148
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,039
to Nebuchadnezzar. Hey listen, there's some guys over here that they didn't bow

149
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:47,080
down. They didn't follow what you told them to do. So Nebuchadnezzar, he's not

150
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:51,320
real pleased with hearing this news. And the Bible tells us in verse number 13

151
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,800
that in his rage and fury, he commanded to bring these fellas into his presence.

152
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,960
Can you imagine? I mean listen, I understand this morning that most all of

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,880
us, you could probably tell us the account. But I just wonder this morning

154
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
if you can put yourself in the shoes of these fellas. I'm talking about not

155
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,720
understanding that they're gonna come out of the fiery furnace. I'm talking

156
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,520
about understanding that you didn't bow. You took a stand. You stood for what was

157
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,339
right. And then the king says, bring them here. And you're being marched into the

158
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,559
presence of this particular time of the most powerful human being on the face of

159
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:41,279
the earth. And he's furious. And he has all this power. And he says, as he

160
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,240
approaches these men coming to his presence, he says this in verse

161
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,800
number 14. Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods,

162
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,360
nor worship the golden image which I have set up? Now, if ye be ready, that at

163
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,520
what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbutt, psalter, and

164
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,759
dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have

165
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,279
made well. But if you worship not, ye should be cast the same hour into the

166
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,519
midst of a burning fiery furnace. Notice the question that ends verse number 15.

167
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:29,200
And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? Do you see the pride

168
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,119
of Nebuchadnezzar? I mean, you look and you understand what Nebuchadnezzar is

169
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:38,480
saying. And he's saying, almost if I could paraphrase it, I'm gonna give you

170
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,279
guys another chance. Maybe you didn't fully understand what I had commanded.

171
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,000
Maybe you didn't understand the consequences, and you violated it the

172
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,119
first time. So now I'm gonna give you another opportunity. And we're gonna play

173
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:56,040
the music again. And if you bow well. You know, a lot of people are looking for

174
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,880
well. A lot of people are looking for comfort and ease, and just kind of go

175
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,559
with the flow. You know what I mean? How is it that we can just kind of make our

176
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:15,640
way through this crazy society? I'm gonna tell you, we're gonna have to stand. We're

177
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:25,320
gonna have to stand. This world has lost its mind. There's no more moral code of

178
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,239
standard that is based on anything that is close to the Word of God which we

179
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,880
believe and preach. We find that we're living in a really, as some have tried to

180
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,359
coin it, a post-truth type of an era in which truth is just relative. It's your

181
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,559
truth, and it's my truth, and it's their truth. I'm sorry to tell you, but the Word

182
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:55,679
of God is truth. The Bible says, Thy Word is truth. Jesus Christ said, I am the way,

183
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,839
the truth, and the life. And we find that we have truth. Listen, I'm not trying

184
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,519
to be ugly with anyone. I'm not trying to cause myself to have enemies. I like

185
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:13,799
people to like me. Do you like having enemies? Come on. I want people to like me.

186
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,160
But I'm much more concerned with God being pleased with my life. Because we're

187
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:28,359
gonna stand before him one day, and these guys, they hear the King. So we're

188
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:33,559
gonna give you another chance. Can you imagine in that moment? Can you

189
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:41,839
imagine the pressures in that moment? Three of you, the most powerful man on

190
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,359
the earth at that particular time, humanly speaking, and he says, here's what

191
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,880
we're gonna do. We're gonna play the music. In your sanctified imagination, can

192
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:03,679
you hear the music playing and see those men stand? They just stand. Wow,

193
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,119
what circumstances they faced. I want you to consider the confidence they

194
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,140
displayed. We consider the circumstances really in verses 1 through 15, and the

195
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,299
next few verses, verses 16 through 18. I want you to consider this confidence in

196
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:25,660
which they displayed. I believe that they had confidence in what God was able to

197
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,019
do. The Bible says in verse number 16, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered

198
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,220
and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this

199
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,339
matter. If it be so, you understand what they're saying? If what you just told us

200
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,779
is gonna be what's gonna happen, if that's gonna happen, we want you to know

201
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:50,859
something. Our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery

202
00:17:50,859 --> 00:18:00,980
furnace. And, by the way, he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. I wonder

203
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,619
this morning, how much confidence do we have in what God is able to do? Honestly,

204
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:13,459
how much confidence do we have in what God is able to do? We understand that

205
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:18,500
Paul says to that same group of people in Ephesus, now unto him which is able to

206
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,660
do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. We know that the

207
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,619
Scriptures are, throughout the entirety of God's Word, revealed to us. They're

208
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,099
full of example of what God is able to do. We find that the questions are asked

209
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:42,099
when God stands before Abraham, and he says to Abraham, I am the Lord God

210
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:46,979
Almighty, El Shaddai. He says, Abraham, and just a little while after he reveals

211
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:53,219
himself in that manner, he says, is anything too hard for me? Oh, do we have

212
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:58,859
confidence in what God is able to do? Are we in a place where we're willing to

213
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,659
exercise that faith that is revealed here in these verses of Scripture? Oh, the

214
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:10,179
great confidence. Listen, if you've seen God work, if you've read this book and

215
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,059
you've allowed this book to influence and impact your life, and you let the

216
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,299
Word of God build your faith as it says it will, we find that we can have great

217
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,659
confidence in what God is able to do. So I don't know how God's gonna do it.

218
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,299
I don't think they knew how God was gonna do it either. They just believed

219
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,059
that God was able. Notice what they say in verse number 18. But if not, I believe

220
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,820
what they're saying here is if he doesn't deliver us out of the burning

221
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,820
fiery furnace, they knew that he would deliver him out of the hand of the king.

222
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,659
They knew that God was able to deliver him from the burning fiery furnace. But

223
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:48,700
if not, be it known unto thee, O king, can you see them standing here? It's similar

224
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,940
to what we read of the the disciples in the book of Acts when they're standing

225
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,140
before the Sanhedrin and they're saying, we understand that you told us that we

226
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,739
can't preach in his name, we understand that you've told us that you're gonna

227
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:03,780
beat us and imprison us, and so on and so forth, but we must

228
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:13,380
obey God. And we find here that they say that we will not serve thy gods, nor

229
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,540
worship the golden image which thou hast set up. I mean, they were

230
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:29,340
confident. They were courageous. They had purposed. They had resolved. We are not

231
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,420
going to bow. I believe that Nebuchadnezzar could have played the

232
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,580
music until today, and they were not gonna bow. You understand? They just,

233
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,180
they were resolved. They were determined to obey God. See, you

234
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,900
understand this morning that what led to their confidence, and not only do we

235
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,260
see that they had confidence in what God could do, but we understand they had

236
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:57,980
confidence in what God had said. You know, the truth is God had given command, and

237
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,780
we find even as you look at the Ten Commandments, thou shalt have no other

238
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,060
gods before me. We find that it's in Leviticus 26, in verse number one, that

239
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,740
here God says, ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a

240
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,020
standing image, neither shall you set up an image of stone in your land, to bow

241
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:24,460
down unto it, for I am the Lord your God. I believe that the confidence that is

242
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,780
displayed here really reveals to us a walk that they had with God, an

243
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,660
understanding that they had of the Word of God, and the decision that they were

244
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,060
making was not an emotional decision. It was not a situation of like, hey, we're

245
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,340
just not gonna stand so we could be different. No, it was a decision that was

246
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,700
based upon biblical principle, and when you make a decision based upon biblical

247
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,220
principle, the biblical principle isn't gonna change. It doesn't matter who's in

248
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,260
the White House, it doesn't matter who controls the government, it doesn't

249
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,020
matter what border we're in, what land we live in, God's Word, based upon the

250
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,220
principles contained therein, when we make decisions in that fashion, it's just

251
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,620
not gonna change. We are not going to bow to your God. We're not gonna do it. I

252
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,700
believe that not only does it reveal that they had a personal walk with God, I

253
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,100
believe the depth of the walk that they had with God, I believe it also reveals

254
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,380
to us that there was a level of preparation. You understand that in order

255
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,180
to stand, we better be preparing to stand, because when those

256
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,540
pressures come, when the consequences, when the bar, the stake is raised as high

257
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,340
as it is here, if we've not prepared to stand, we're probably gonna bow. We're

258
00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:00,060
gonna justify it somehow in our minds. Everybody else is doing it. You probably

259
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,300
said that as a teenager like I did. Why can't I do that, mom? Why can't I do that?

260
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,500
That everybody else is doing it. I think I only said that a handful of times,

261
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,180
honestly, because each time I said that, they said, okay, tell me who's doing it,

262
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:21,420
and it was just like, mmm, everybody. But you understand. Notice what the wise man

263
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:29,260
says, Solomon, Proverbs 24. Notice what he says in Proverbs 24 and verse number 10.

264
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,900
What a great truth that God gives us here in this verse of Scripture. The

265
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,380
Bible says in Proverbs 24 and verse number 10, if thou faint in the day of

266
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:51,020
adversity, thy strength is small. Can I tell you this morning that the day of

267
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:58,220
adversity is gonna come? It's gonna come. It's not talking about physical strength,

268
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,660
however. See, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, as I referenced in Ephesians

269
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,380
6 this morning by way of introduction. We wrestle against spiritual wickedness in

270
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,540
high places. And here he's not speaking about our strength being small, meaning

271
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,900
that our physical strength is small. Remember, Paul said, in my weakness, then

272
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,460
I'm strong. Why? Because his strength is made perfect in weakness. And we find that

273
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,340
as we would look to the Word of God and we'd understand the importance of being

274
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,860
strengthened in the inner man, that we walk in the Spirit, that we have the

275
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,980
boldness that only comes as a result of being filled with the Holy Spirit of

276
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,860
God. And we find that these men, I believe that as we look at this passage and

277
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:47,140
consider this example, that these men, they had had this confidence, and it's

278
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,060
confidence in what God could do, it's confidence in what God had said. I

279
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,860
believe that it reveals to us that they had a close walk with God, and they had

280
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,380
prepared. They had prepared for this day. I don't know that you say, so they knew

281
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,820
it was going to happen? I'm not saying that they knew exactly what was going to

282
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,260
happen, just like you don't know exactly what's going to happen. But there's this

283
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,540
preparation as we walk with God. And when that day of adversity comes, we're

284
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:21,580
walking with God, our inner man has been strengthened, and we're able to stand. Not

285
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,980
in our own power, but in the power of God. And we're able to stand. We see the

286
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,220
confidence that was displayed. I want you to consider with me, as we continue

287
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,140
through this passage of Scripture, I want you to consider number three, the

288
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:41,620
communion they enjoyed. The communion they enjoyed. It's really interesting as

289
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,660
you look at verses 19 through 26, and we understand again, as we're familiar with

290
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,580
the passage of Scripture, that these men find themselves in this fiery

291
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,380
furnace. But I want you to consider for a moment the communion that they enjoyed.

292
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,660
The reality is that the Bible says that the stakes were so high, Nebuchadnezzar

293
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,340
is so furious. I mean, can you imagine the embarrassment of Nebuchadnezzar? I mean,

294
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,820
you know his pride, we've already discussed it. And now all of these people

295
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,580
are there, and they bring these three before him, and he says, here's what's

296
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:22,300
gonna happen, you're gonna bow. And they just stand. They just stand. It says that

297
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,780
Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury in verse number 19. The form of his visage was

298
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,260
changed. See, I believe in verse number 13, when it says that he was in his rage

299
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,700
and fury that he brought him before him, but he's offering them another

300
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,780
opportunity, and we're gonna play it again, and you're gonna bow, and it's

301
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,380
gonna be well. And when they don't, he's full of fury. His visage was

302
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,420
changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spake, he

303
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,660
commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was

304
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,940
wont to be heated. He commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind

305
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,300
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.

306
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,020
So he heats it up seven times hotter than what it was going to be set to, and

307
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:18,300
he finds the mightiest within his army to bind these men. It was so hot that the

308
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,420
men were slain that threw these three into the fire. Notice in verse 21, then

309
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,980
these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, their hats, their other

310
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,180
garments, and were cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Therefore,

311
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,460
because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the

312
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,300
flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

313
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:51,620
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into

314
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:58,580
the midst of the burning fiery furnace. But then Nebuchadnezzar's a stone-eyed.

315
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,700
He's astonished as to what happens. The Bible tells us in verse number 24 that

316
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,500
he rose up in haste, and he speaks to his counselors that are there, and he

317
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,580
asked this question, did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the

318
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,860
fire? They answered and said unto the king, true, O king. I mean, he's in a

319
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,300
position where he's looking at what he's seeing, and he's saying, hey listen,

320
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,740
wasn't it three? And weren't they bound? Yes, true, O king. You've not lost your

321
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:43,100
mind. Yes, that's what we did. He answered and said, lo, I see four men loose. He

322
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,500
says they're loose, and they're walking in the midst of the fire, and they have

323
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:58,060
no hurt. And the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. I want you to

324
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,260
consider the communion that they have.

325
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:13,220
They enjoyed communion with God in a way that I don't know we can fully

326
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:20,300
comprehend, because it was their obedience to God that led to the fire.

327
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:27,300
It was their obedience to God that led to the fire. And they go in bound seven

328
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:36,260
times hotter. The men that cast them in are killed. The king says they're walking

329
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,300
around. I mean, can you imagine King Nebuchadnezzar looking at this like,

330
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:49,100
what is going on? How is this even possible? Remember what he said in verse

331
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,540
number 15, who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? See, he

332
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,300
thought he had all this power, and he thought that if he raised the

333
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,780
stakes high enough, you're gonna bow.

334
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,000
I've heard people say this,

335
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,800
everybody has a price.

336
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,320
I hope you don't have a price.

337
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,120
I hope that there's not some stake

338
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,980
that the enemy could raise it to

339
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,040
and you say, okay, enough is enough.

340
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,240
I'm just going to do what you want me to do.

341
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,680
I'll bow if you want me to bow.

342
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,860
I'm not going in that furnace.

343
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,700
It says in v. 26,

344
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,800
then Nebuchadnezzar came near

345
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,720
to the mouth of the burning, fiery furnace

346
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,460
and spake.

347
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,800
Can you imagine?

348
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,980
In my mind's eye, the people are still there.

349
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,120
It was in that same hour.

350
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,240
And he's talking to these guys.

351
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,800
Now maybe there's some that are deep in the crowd

352
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,160
and they've not heard what was just asked

353
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,400
of the counselors.

354
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,160
And they see the king walk over there

355
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,880
and he's talking.

356
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,660
Now, if you were an observer,

357
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,380
you saw the three men die that cast them in.

358
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,660
Who's he talking to?

359
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,340
Surely they're dead, right?

360
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,500
As an observer.

361
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,320
And it says here that he spake

362
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,060
and he said,

363
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,220
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

364
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,320
Notice what he says.

365
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,160
Ye servants of the Most High God.

366
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,240
Come forth and come hither.

367
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,820
Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

368
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,280
came forth in the midst of the fire.

369
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,600
I can't even imagine being an observer

370
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,920
and seeing those boys walk out.

371
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,080
What is going on?

372
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,560
Right?

373
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,280
And they come walking out.

374
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,560
I don't know how long

375
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,460
they were in the burning, fiery furnace.

376
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,680
I don't think you do either.

377
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,640
It doesn't seem that it was extremely long

378
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,020
that they were there in the burning, fiery furnace.

379
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,860
But they spent more time in that burning, fiery furnace

380
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,320
than you did.

381
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,140
Or than I have.

382
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,080
And it was because they were willing to stand.

383
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,700
That they went in that burning, fiery furnace.

384
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,220
And the reality is that as we look at this,

385
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,700
and we think about the communion that they enjoyed,

386
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,780
we find that the psalmist says that in Thy presence

387
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,400
is fullness of joy.

388
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,740
Jeremiah, of course, he's prophesying

389
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,460
on the eve of captivity.

390
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,440
And in fact, Jeremiah's prophesying

391
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,240
when the Babylonians have besieged the city

392
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,760
and he sees them all around.

393
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,440
He understands what's going to happen.

394
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,460
But God gives word after word to Jeremiah.

395
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,200
And in here, in Jeremiah 42 and v. 11,

396
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,040
the Bible says,

397
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,100
be not afraid of the King of Babylon,

398
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,520
of whom you are afraid.

399
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,240
Be not afraid of Him, saith the Lord,

400
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,580
for I am with you to save you

401
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,820
and to deliver you from His hand.

402
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,540
Jeremiah 42 and v. 11.

403
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,680
Don't be afraid of Him.

404
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,140
The One you're afraid of, don't be afraid of Him.

405
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,960
Why? Because I'm with you.

406
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,480
I'm with you.

407
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,860
Man, they had some communion with God.

408
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,160
We understand that as we look at the truth

409
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,260
of the New Testament,

410
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,860
Jesus said in Matthew 28

411
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,260
before His ascension,

412
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,340
all power is given unto Me.

413
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
He gives the great commission.

414
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,220
And He says, lo, I am with you always.

415
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,900
Hebrews 13 and v. 5,

416
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,860
a precious promise of the Word of God.

417
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,940
He will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

418
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,140
When we understand the truth of v. 6,

419
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,100
He is my Helper.

420
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Therefore, who or what am I going to fear?

421
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,940
The psalmist said in Psalm 121,

422
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,780
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.

423
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,220
From whence cometh my help?

424
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,420
My help cometh from the Lord

425
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,060
which made heaven and earth.

426
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,140
He is my Helper.

427
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,020
He's your Helper.

428
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,980
And here, these men,

429
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,140
they find themselves in the fiery furnace,

430
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,820
they find themselves enjoying some communion with God.

431
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,940
Can I tell you this morning that

432
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,580
if you're going to stand and if I'm going to stand,

433
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,620
we may face some consequences.

434
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,940
But can I tell you,

435
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,020
God will be with you.

436
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,140
God will be with you.

437
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,700
And you'll have seasons of communion

438
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,140
that are sweeter than you've ever enjoyed

439
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,420
any time before.

440
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,340
I think about Paul and Silas

441
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,900
when they were in prison.

442
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,740
They were cast into the prison fast,

443
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,460
locked away.

444
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,380
But man, they were singing, were they not?

445
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,660
Singing to God, they were having communion with God.

446
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,020
See, this morning,

447
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,620
I believe that we better prepare to stand.

448
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,700
And I believe that as I look at a passage like Daniel 3,

449
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,020
that I'm encouraged.

450
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,380
This is an encouraging passage of Scripture.

451
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,020
It's exciting.

452
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,020
To read the account, this isn't some fairy tale.

453
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,380
This is God's Word. This happened.

454
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,460
And not only does it encourage us,

455
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,300
I believe it should challenge us.

456
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,220
Because am I willing to stand?

457
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,300
Are you willing to stand?

458
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,540
I mean, when the stakes are like they were for these three,

459
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,860
are we willing to stand?

460
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,220
In closing, I want you to consider

461
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,940
some consequences of their stand.

462
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,020
I want you to consider with me a few things

463
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,940
as we look at the remainder of the passage.

464
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,380
I want you to, just for a moment,

465
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,860
consider how this experience

466
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,220
impacted their own lives.

467
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,620
Can you imagine?

468
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,860
Listen, when you see God work,

469
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,340
when you see God do something miraculous,

470
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,220
it has an impact in your life.

471
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,340
Do you think that these men

472
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,420
talked about this experience?

473
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,780
I mean, I do.

474
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,940
I don't have any Bible to prove it to you.

475
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,500
But I see these guys talking about

476
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,980
there was a time that we were in the burning fiery furnace.

477
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,340
Let me tell you what happened.

478
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,940
Can you imagine the generational impact

479
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,140
maybe to their grandchildren

480
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,340
as they would sit and talk about what God did?

481
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,460
Man, it had an impact in their lives.

482
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,260
But in verse 27, I want you to notice

483
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,980
how this experience impacted the lives

484
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,660
of the princes, the governors, the captains,

485
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,500
and the king's counselors.

486
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,140
Notice what it says in verse 27.

487
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,940
Again, to get back to the context,

488
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,700
Nebuchadnezzar has come close to the mouth

489
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,780
of the burning fiery furnace.

490
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,900
He says to these men,

491
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,260
ye servants of the Most High God,

492
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,540
come forth, and they came hither.

493
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,420
They came forth out of the midst of the fire.

494
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,860
It says in verse 27,

495
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,300
and the princes, governors, and captains,

496
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,700
and the king's counselors,

497
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,980
being gathered together,

498
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,540
notice these three words,

499
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,260
saw these men.

500
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,980
They saw it.

501
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,940
They were eyewitnesses of these men

502
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,820
walking out of the burning fiery furnace.

503
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,180
And it says,

504
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,100
upon whose bodies the fire had no power,

505
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,660
nor was a hair of their head singed,

506
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,140
neither were their coats changed,

507
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,540
nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

508
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,580
How many of you have ever been to a bonfire?

509
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,420
How many of you, when you got home,

510
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,100
smelled like bonfire?

511
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,980
How many of you have ever grilled?

512
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,020
And you try not to touch the flame,

513
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,220
but those little hairs get singed up.

514
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,260
Right?

515
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
These men were in the midst

516
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,780
of the burning fiery furnace.

517
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,660
And all these fellows that were there,

518
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,500
the princes, the governors, the captains,

519
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,820
the king's counselors,

520
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,620
they see these men walk out,

521
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,660
and they're not bound anymore.

522
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,860
The fire had no power on them.

523
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,620
They have not a hair singed.

524
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,780
And they don't even smell like fire.

525
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,980
Now that would cause those guys

526
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,300
to kind of like, what is going on?

527
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,580
Right? I mean, seriously.

528
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:27,060
You remember back in the book of Exodus,

529
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,220
when Pharaoh said something similar

530
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,900
to Moses about who is your God?

531
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,700
God, through a series of events,

532
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,380
the plagues as we refer to them as,

533
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,340
revealed who He was.

534
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,460
The power that He has.

535
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,660
So much so that the counselors of Pharaoh

536
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,140
said this is nothing more than

537
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,340
the finger of God.

538
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,580
Nebuchadnezzar says,

539
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,900
ye servants of the Most High God,

540
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,580
come out!

541
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,580
And all of these idol-worshiping Babylonians

542
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,660
see these men walk out with no hurt.

543
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,100
I don't think any of them were lining up

544
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,660
to go in it to see if their gods could deliver.

545
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,220
Do you?

546
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,100
Nuh-uh.

547
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,580
What an impact,

548
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,060
as we think about the consequences

549
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,100
of their stand.

550
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,300
Listen, when you stand,

551
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,420
there are going to be some consequences.

552
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,620
There's going to be some impact in your life,

553
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,420
in my life.

554
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,740
But in the lives of others around us,

555
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,420
they see what God is able to do.

556
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,740
They see that it's not just a theory.

557
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,820
You know, this book is so much more than theory.

558
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,700
To walk with God is not just a theory kind of thing.

559
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,100
It's real life.

560
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,340
God is really able.

561
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,780
God delivers.

562
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,980
God works.

563
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,500
And we find that this experience

564
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,580
not only impacted these men personally,

565
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,940
it impacted those in leadership around the king,

566
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:03,100
but it also impacted Nebuchadnezzar.

567
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Verse number 28, it says...

568
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:13,500
this. He spake and said, blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who

569
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,060
hath sent his angel and delivered his servants. Now stop there, we're gonna read

570
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,540
the rest of it in just a moment. But you notice that this man Nebuchadnezzar, he

571
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,580
said, who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand? And we find that now

572
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,180
he says, ye servants of the Most High God, and he says, blessed be the God of these

573
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,300
men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has delivered his servants, but notice

574
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,780
what he recognizes, that those servants that were delivered, that they first

575
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:49,660
trusted in him. We sing trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in

576
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:58,240
Jesus, but to trust and obey. Why is it that we should trust God? Because he's

577
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,880
faithful, because he always does what he says he will do. We find that God, as the

578
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,760
children of Israel are given the assignment to go into the the land of

579
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,360
promise, and Moses sends out the spies, and they come back with the evil report,

580
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,560
and Joshua and Caleb are seeking to influence the congregation to go and

581
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,440
believe God, and they were ready to stone those guys. God says, how long will it be

582
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:31,720
are my people believe me? Trust me, that we have confidence in God. See, it says

583
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,760
that this man, Nebuchadnezzar, he recognized that these servants were

584
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,080
delivered, but it was a result that they trusted in him, and then notice this, and

585
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:49,520
have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might

586
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:59,800
not serve nor worship any God except their own God. It impacted Nebuchadnezzar.

587
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:07,320
He said, these guys trusted in God, they yielded their bodies. It's interesting if

588
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,800
you were to go and maybe jot it down in your notes to read Romans 6 about who we

589
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,800
yield ourselves to. We are to yield ourselves unto the Lord, and we find that

590
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,960
these men, they yielded themselves. It's interesting if you look in Romans 6

591
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,000
and you read the references with regard to the word yield or yielded, it's the

592
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,360
same Greek word that is used in Romans 12 when he says that you would present

593
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:38,800
your bodies a living sacrifice. Same exact Greek word. So, yielding and

594
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,280
presenting our bodies to God, and see what God is able to do. He said, I'm not

595
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,480
interested in signing up for all that. I don't want to be a martyr. Neither do I.

596
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,320
I mean, honestly, I don't want to face, I don't want to go to prison. I don't want

597
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,600
to do any of that stuff, but we got to stand. We got to stand. We have to be

598
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,400
resolved. The pressures are only going to continue to increase. Listen, we have the

599
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,800
Word of God, and the Bible says that in the last days, perilous times are going

600
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,760
to come. They're here. Evil men and seducers are going to get better. No, they're

601
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,520
going to wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. Is that not what the

602
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,520
Word of God says, tells us? Clearly, God gives us the instruction. We find that

603
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,480
really as we look at the consequences and we see the impact upon these groups

604
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,640
of people, I want you to understand that God was glorified, and that's what it's

605
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,440
all about. It's not really about us saying, oh, look at these guys. They were

606
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,360
so bold to stand for God. I'm thankful that they were, but God was glorified. It

607
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:59,480
says in verse 29, therefore, I make a decree. Now, he started the chapter by

608
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,120
making a decree that everybody bow down to his image, and now he makes a decree

609
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,920
at the end of the chapter that every people, nation, and language would speak

610
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,520
anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be

611
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,800
cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill. Why? Because there is no

612
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:32,360
other God that can deliver after this sort. God was glorified. Then the king

613
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,760
promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon. God was

614
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,640
glorified. You know, it's interesting to me. We think about the consequences. You

615
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:50,160
know, it's been some 2,600 years since this event took place, and we're still

616
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:58,840
talking about it. 2,600 years. That's a long time, and we're still receiving

617
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:05,080
encouragement from some individuals that were willing to stand. They're willing to

618
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:13,920
stand. They just simply said, listen, I can't do this. I cannot be influenced by

619
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:21,920
your ideologies. I will not bow. I will not conform because I have a higher

620
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:30,040
authority. I have a higher authority, the highest authority, and one day I'm gonna

621
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:37,480
stand before him. So are you. The question, however, as we think about this event, we

622
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:45,360
think about the title of the message this morning, are you willing to stand?

623
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Am I willing to stand? Can I fill you in? It's easy to stand in here. It is. You

624
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,520
take a stand in here, man, we cheer you on. Amen! But we got to be willing to

625
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:13,960
stand out there. Out there. In a lost and dying world, they need to see that our

626
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:22,800
God is real. It's not just a theory. You know, they don't think much of our God.

627
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:30,840
They really don't. They curse him. They hold their fist against him. They need to

628
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,680
see that our God is real. Do you believe this morning that God is still able to

629
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,680
work? I don't know that there's gonna be a burning fiery furnace. Again, the

630
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,920
circumstances, the pressures are different for every generation, but we're

631
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,160
facing some pressures today, and there's a movement today to cause you and to

632
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,760
cause me to bow, to conform, to we can't talk about this, we can't talk about

633
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:04,880
that, we can't go there, we can't go here. And they want a silence. They want us to

634
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,720
be ashamed. I've said that a couple of times the last few weeks because of our

635
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:14,480
theme for our missions conference. I am not ashamed. And this morning, are we

636
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:23,240
willing to stand? Are we willing to stand? I'm encouraged by Daniel 3, but

637
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,120
really more than being encouraged, I'm challenged. Because I look at these three

638
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:34,600
guys, they didn't have all that we have. We got the whole book, but they had a

639
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:41,000
real close walk with God that caused them to have some some strength and some

640
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:50,400
resolve spiritually to say, I understand the stakes. I heard the command. Yes, I

641
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,960
heard the music, but I'm not gonna bow. It's not gonna do it. Are you willing to

642
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,440
stand? Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for

643
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:12,600
your Word. I thank you how that we can go to your Word and be encouraged, and at

644
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,880
the same time be challenged. I thank you for the challenge that Paul gives the

645
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,040
believers in Ephesus, and how that we can look at this event that happened 2,600

646
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:35,120
years ago, and see some men that stood. We understand and acknowledge readily

647
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,200
this morning that we're facing pressures in our society, in our culture, to bow

648
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,960
and to conform to the ideologies. God, I pray that you would help us to walk in

649
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,400
the Spirit. I pray that you'd help us to put on the armor, that we would be able

650
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:02,760
to stand in the evil day. Would you help us this morning to let you have your

651
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:11,920
will and way in our lives? Help us to truly yield ourselves to thee. We pray

652
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,880
that you'd be glorified through every decision, and we'll thank you for it.

653
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,160
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. It's our custom to have

654
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,080
an invitation at the end of our service in order to give you an opportunity to

655
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,480
respond to how God may have spoken to you through His Word. Kimberly will play

656
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,080
quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar is open. You don't want to come to this

657
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,160
old-fashioned altar. Maybe you want to make your seat an altar, but would

658
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,520
you let God have His way in your life? As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
