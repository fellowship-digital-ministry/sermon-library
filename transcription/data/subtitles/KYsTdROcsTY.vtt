00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.199
15, 2 Samuel chapter number 15, this morning, and I'm going to look at a passage of Scripture

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:11.239
here really to use as a springboard, if you will, be looking more at a topical type of

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.800
a message this morning.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.079
Typically, I preach expository messages, but God's put this thought on my heart and I could

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.959
not get away from it, and I trust it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.879
As you look at 2 Samuel 15, you'll find out that the immediate context of this passage

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.159
of Scripture details a very difficult time in the life of King David.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.880
We know that God had used King David in an amazing way, in fact, as you look at the history

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.680
of the kings of Israel, you often will look at King David as being right there at the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.880
top of the list, and God used him miraculously, magnificently, as he yielded and surrendered

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.099
his life to the Lord.

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:56.319
But the immediate context of 2 Samuel 15 begins to reveal to us the way in which his son Absalom

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.840
had revolted against him.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.480
We find that his revolt was both subtle and strategic, and we find that he gained a significant

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480
following.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.680
In fact, he implemented an approach, and we're told in 2 Samuel 15, in verse number 6, notice

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.319
at the end of the verse of Scripture, the Bible says, so Absalom stole the hearts of

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:25.120
the men of Israel, and we find that God is revealing to us these difficult days here

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.879
in the life of King David, and we find that the situation worsened quickly.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.639
We find that David then gives instruction, pick it up with me, in verse number 12, the

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:41.919
Bible says that Absalom sent for Ahithophel, the Gileadite, David's counselor from his

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:47.879
city, even from Gilo, where while he offered sacrifices, notice the Bible says, and the

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:55.120
conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.760
There came a messenger to David saying, the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.519
And so again, we see the immediate context of what's taking place in the life of King

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:11.440
David, and we find that he's been given this word, and he understands the conspiracy is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.520
great, he understands that the following is growing, it's increasing continually, and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
the Bible tells us in verse number 6, and then again in verse number 13, that the hearts

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.720
of the men of Israel were after Absalom, and David finds himself in this very difficult

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.320
situation, and we find that David then speaks to his servants in verse number 14, and notice

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.240
what David says unto his servants, it says, and David said unto all his servants that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.440
were with him at Jerusalem, arise and let us flee, for we shall not else escape from

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
Absalom.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.639
Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.119
the city with the edge of the sword.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:02.119
You begin to look at David speaking to his servants here, and you find just by the instruction

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:07.880
that he provides in verse number 14, the difficulty, I mean, the extent of the circumstances in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.240
which David is facing, and he says that they're to rise up, he says, let us flee.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.240
Notice what he says, make speed to depart.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.800
We notice what David is saying because of the circumstances that he's facing, but really

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.479
what I want to look at this morning is the response of the servants to the king.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:37.839
In verse number 15, my attention is drawn to this verse of Scripture because of the

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:45.679
manner in which the servants of King David responded to his instruction.

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:54.919
In verse number 15, the Bible says this, and the king's servants said unto the king, behold,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:04.399
thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.960
Wow.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.000
What a response.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.399
When I see the response of these servants, I find that their response reveals to me their

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.679
respect for the king.

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.239
Notice what they say, thy servants.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.079
They recognized his position as being the king of Israel.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.239
They had a certain level of respect or reverence, if I could use that term this morning, for

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:29.040
King David.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.679
Not only do the servants respond in verse 15 by saying thy servants, but notice the

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:40.359
response reveals to us their preparation for it says that they are ready.

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:43.359
Thy servants are ready.

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:46.000
And then notice what it says to do.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.160
It reveals to me their obedience.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.519
Then we find that they say whatsoever, their submission.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:04.480
They are recognizing the position of David as being the king.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.660
Not only are they recognizing the position of David being king and they're reverencing

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.480
or respecting his position, but it reveals to us that they have prepared.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.720
They say we are ready.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.980
We are ready.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:26.880
We are prepared to do, to obey whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.079
We'd like to make an application as I look at this verse of Scripture this morning and

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:34.920
I see the servants of King David and King David is a mere man.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.079
He's a mere human being.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:39.799
Yes, he is the king of Israel, but he's a man.

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.480
And we serve the king of kings, lord of lords.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.440
And we begin to think about our lord, our king, providing for us instruction in the

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.079
same manner in which King David, the earthly human king, provides instruction to his servants

00:05:55.079 --> 00:06:02.440
and these servants respond in a manner in which is exemplary for us today.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.839
Lord, thy servants, we recognize his lordship in our lives.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.559
We recognize that he is king, that he is master.

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.359
We recognize and we reverence our God.

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:24.640
We ought to be prepared to do whatsoever our God would give us to do.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.600
We ought to be willing to submit, to yield, to surrender our lives to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.239
He is king of kings.

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:33.320
He is lord of lords.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.920
I'm so thankful that he's my savior, that he's my redeemer, but he is my lord.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.480
He is my master.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.559
And I'm mindful of what was said in John chapter number two, the first miracle, the marriage

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:47.559
at Cana.

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:54.239
We find that Mary says to those servants about the Lord Jesus Christ, she says, whatsoever

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:57.679
he sayeth unto you, do it.

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:03.679
Wow, what instruction that Mary would give to those servants and as they would follow

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:08.880
that instruction as you read John two, you see that they did and they knew.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.920
Many people wondered about the miracle, but they knew what was accomplished.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920
Why?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.959
Because they were obedient to what the master told them to do.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:23.480
We think about this passage of scripture and we find that there are several other passages

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.079
that deal with this subject matter.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:30.600
In fact, the Bible would describe Ezra in Ezra chapter seven in verse number six as

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.200
a ready scribe.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.480
When we were in Israel just a few weeks ago, Brother Jeff preached a great message on the

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.760
life of Ezra.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.760
But we find that as you think about this term as Ezra being a ready scribe, that the Bible

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.239
gives us insight as to why he's referred to in that manner is in verse number ten.

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:56.959
The Bible says, for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:02.920
do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.959
See Ezra was ready, he's referred to, God refers to Ezra as a ready scribe.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:14.079
Peter, well Peter declared that he was ready.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:18.160
Take your Bibles if you will and look at the book of Luke and chapter number 22 and I want

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.359
you to notice what Peter says in Luke chapter number 22 because he declared he was ready.

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:29.160
And I look at these two particular examples because Ezra is described by God as being

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.520
a ready scribe and no doubt as you study the life of Ezra and you find his preparation

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:41.239
is recorded to us in verse number ten, that God indeed provided Ezra with a unique opportunity

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:47.200
to teach in Israel statutes and judgments and God used Ezra in an amazing way.

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:51.359
And yes, God would use Peter in an amazing way, but in the text of Scripture that we're

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:55.799
looking at here in Luke chapter number 22, we find that it's Peter that is declaring

00:08:55.799 --> 00:09:02.520
that he was ready and notice what the Bible says in verse number 31 of Luke 22.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:08.299
The Lord is speaking to Peter and he says, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:12.000
have you, that he may sift you as wheat.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.080
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted, strengthen

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080
thy brethren.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:25.239
It's amazing to me that the Lord Jesus Christ is revealing to Peter in these verses of Scripture

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:30.359
the fact that he has an enemy and that the enemy desires to devour and to destroy and

00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:37.000
yet Peter's response in verse number 33, he says unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.440
thee both into prison and to death.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.400
If you read the remainder of Luke 22, you find that Peter would soon deny the Lord Jesus

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.799
Christ on three occasions.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:55.080
He was not really ready as he had pronounced himself to be ready.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.080
We find that later on in the life of Peter, God would use him in a miraculous manner.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.280
in a magnificent way, and I'm so thankful

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.320
that God would give him that opportunity.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.360
But when I think about these examples this morning,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.820
and especially the response of those servants

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.120
in 2 Samuel 15 and verse number 15,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.560
I ask myself and I ask you this question this morning,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.600
and we use it for the title of the message,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.040
are you ready, are you ready?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.000
And you say, pastor, ready for what?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.600
I mean, am I ready to leave church?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.900
I mean, lunch is gonna be soon.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.140
Asking a question, are you ready, requires context.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.140
We begin to look at the word of God

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.660
and begin to think about and meditate upon the truth

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.180
that's before us this morning,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.260
and God reveals to us that there are some areas

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.380
in our lives, in the life of every child of God,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.640
where we ought to be ready.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.020
Notice with me a proclamation from Paul,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.500
number one, if you're taking notes,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.460
we ought to be ready to preach the gospel.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.300
Look in Romans chapter number one, if you will, with me,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.140
and of course, we're familiar with this passage

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.220
of scripture, but in Romans chapter number one,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.180
I find Paul is writing here to these believers,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.380
and he's expressed, as you study the book of Acts,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.220
he's expressed a desire to get to Rome,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.640
and we find that God has given him revelation

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.620
that he would speak of him in Rome,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.060
and God would, through a series of events,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.660
bring him there, but I want you to notice

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.660
as he's writing this particular book,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.180
that Paul is writing, and he says in verse number 14

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.740
of Romans chapter number one,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.540
I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.920
both to the wise and to the unwise,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.540
but then notice in verse number 15,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.700
he says, so, as much as in me is,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.000
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.740
that are at Rome also.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.800
And I think about this being ready to preach the gospel.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.580
I believe this morning that Paul understood the power

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.820
of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.260
He would declare it in the very next verse of Scripture,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.060
in verse 16, where the Bible says,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.960
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.800
Why?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.580
For it is the power of God unto salvation

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.940
to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.980
and also to the Greek.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.060
As we begin to understand the apostle Paul,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.540
what was it that brought him to a place of preparation?

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.880
What was it that brought him to a place

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.460
of being able to declare, I am ready to preach the gospel?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.980
And I ask myself this morning,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.860
and I ask you to ask of yourself this morning,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.840
are you ready to preach the gospel?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.100
We begin to understand the power of the gospel,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.980
but then we also notice that as we begin

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.580
to trace the steps of the apostle Paul,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.340
it's not just a declaration that he makes,

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.060
but it's a manner that he lives.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.020
Begin to read the book of Acts

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.540
and trace the steps of the apostle Paul,

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.860
and it wasn't just something that he said,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.700
I'm ready to preach the gospel,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.100
but he lived it, and every opportunity

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.540
that God would give him, he would seize those opportunities

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.380
to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.020
We find that the Bible will tell us,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.760
as you study the missionary journeys,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.980
how that God would give opportunity for Paul

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.700
to travel from place to place,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.980
and as God would give those opportunities,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.940
that he would enter in and he would begin to reason

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.500
with the inhabitants of those particular cities

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.920
and villages out of the scriptures,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.540
declaring that this Jesus is Christ,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.500
that he is the Messiah, that he is the fulfillment

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.580
of the prophecies of the Old Testament,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.260
and he would preach Christ.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.740
He once was going forth as one that would

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.100
hail people and imprison people.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.760
He was persecuting the church,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.100
but something amazing happened in his life,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.060
and he was saved by the grace of God.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.020
You read it in Acts chapter number nine,

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.580
and after he was saved by the grace of God,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.340
he understood that he'd been given this wonderful truth.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.220
He says this to the believers in Corinth,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.300
that you have a treasure in this earthen vessel.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.660
He says that if our gospel be hid,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.700
it is hid to them that are lost,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.780
and so the apostle Paul, he understood

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.900
that he'd been entrusted with the gospel

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.340
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.900
He had been enabled to be able to serve in this capacity.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.140
He says, I am ready to preach the gospel,

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.420
and I wonder this morning,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.180
are we ready to preach the gospel?

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.420
The Bible will say this of the apostle Paul

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.500
as you trace his steps in the book of Acts,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.780
as his manner was.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.460
This was his behavior.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.860
This is what he did.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.260
He always, as he would go to these new cities

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.100
and these new locations, he would seek the opportunity,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.380
and then I would say it this way,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.340
he would seize the opportunity to give the gospel.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.300
I'm mindful of the first missionary journey.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.380
They first get there, and they enter into the synagogue,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.420
and the folks there say some things and whatever,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.860
and then they say, does anyone have anything to say?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.820
Paul says, absolutely.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.420
I mean, he was ready to preach the gospel.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.740
I would say it this way, that we need to be intentional.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.140
We need to be intentional.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.140
We need to work in our lives

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.740
to get the conversation to Jesus.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.580
Amen?

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.980
Get the conversation to Jesus,

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.780
that we would be intentional about this matter

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.420
of preaching the gospel,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.820
that we could stand with the apostle Paul

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.460
as he writes here into the inspiration

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.420
of the Holy Spirit of God in Romans 1,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.940
and say, I am ready to preach the gospel.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.180
Number two, if you're taking notes,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.140
we ought to be ready to give an answer,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.180
and absolutely, this is going to be closely associated

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.260
to what we've just read and what we've dealt with

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.140
in being ready to preach the gospel,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.260
but I want you to think about what the word of God says

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.140
in 1 Peter chapter number three.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.340
If you take a moment and turn

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.140
to 1 Peter chapter number three,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.900
and of course, we mentioned about Peter making

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.980
that declaration in Luke chapter number 22,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.980
and now God would use Peter as he's writing this epistle,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.300
and then of course, the second epistle,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.660
and God used him in an amazing way.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.980
God had told him, the Lord Jesus Christ said,

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.820
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.300
and one way in which God enabled Peter

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.780
to strengthen the brethren was through writing

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.140
these two epistles under the inspiration

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.700
of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.020
and we begin to think about this truth

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.300
of what we find here in 1 Peter chapter number three,

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.140
and the word of God tells us,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.700
and notice what Peter's saying.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.340
He says, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.340
and then notice these words, and be ready always.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.460
That's an important word.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.100
Be ready always for what?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.100
To give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:57.060
of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.460
So the Bible encourages us as the people of God

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.180
to be ready always to give an answer,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.700
that we would be in this place

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.860
where we are constantly prepared,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.140
this state of preparation where we're ready

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.340
to give an answer many times as we begin

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.540
to think about our own lives,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.700
and maybe as we would evaluate and even mention

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.500
about Paul saying that he was ready to preach the gospel,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.660
that he sees the opportunities.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.300
If we're not careful in our lives,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.940
many times we squander the opportunities.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.500
We miss the opportunities.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.340
Why?

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.540
Maybe we're not looking for them.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.460
We're not as alert as we need to be,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.500
but here the word of God says that we ought to be always,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.780
we're to be ready always to give an answer.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.180
To give an answer of what?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.580
To answer every question that comes down the line.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.300
No, God actually tells us the word of God

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.140
to avoid foolish questions, amen?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.340
And so we find that there are some

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.600
that will just ask us foolish questions

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.500
to try to attack us and to discourage us

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.040
in whatever the case may be,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.520
but the reality is that even in those moments,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.640
if we're intentional about getting the message

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.640
of the gospel and understanding of it

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.240
as the power of God unto salvation

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.540
and steering that conversation to the person

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.380
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that God will use that.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.840
But he says that we're to be ready always to give an answer.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.680
Notice what it says.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.840
To every man that asketh you a reason

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.480
of the hope that is in you.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.480
I love the phrase of Scripture.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.000
When we think about Christ in you,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.640
the hope of glory.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.360
That's what Paul says in the book of Galatians.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.119
We begin to understand that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:35.239
at the moment of salvation,

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.280
the Holy Spirit of God indwells us

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.640
and we become his child

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.360
and we understand that we have this hope.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.480
We have a hope that the world does not have.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.720
When we speak about this word hope,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.080
so many times in our society today,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.720
it's gotten misunderstood because we use the word

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.540
to really kind of deal with this wishful thinking

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.640
kind of an idea.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.119
I hope that this happens or I hope that that happens.

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:03.480
And the missionary mentioned,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.360
if you have any questions about Brazil winning the World Cup

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.480
and there were some that were hoping that America would win

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.239
and they lost yesterday.

00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:15.280
And we find that there's this use of this word hope,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.280
but as a child of God, our hope is not some wishful idea.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:27.160
It is a certain expectation

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.480
that God is who he says he is

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.220
and he will do what he says he will do.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.540
We speak about the blessed hope.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.080
The Bible speaks of that term in the book of Titus

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.679
and we see that we are looking for our God

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.280
and savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.640
and refers to it as being the blessed hope of the believer

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.400
that Jesus is coming.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.280
And he says that we're to be ready always to give an answer

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.960
to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.799
that is in you.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:58.400
And he says, with meekness and fear.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:10.000
Not with cockiness and pride, I'm better than you, no, no, with meekness and with fear.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.400
The measure of humility that we would have as we begin to give an answer to every man

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.880
that would ask us of the hope that is within us, that we would take the truth of this verse

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.900
of Scripture and that we would respond with meekness and with fear, and that we would

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.780
understand that God has entrusted us with this truth, and because of that, it makes

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.140
us responsible.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.060
Many times we have the perspective, if we're not careful, that having the truth would make

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.500
us better.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:48.220
And I'm so thankful to have the truth, but it makes us responsible to a world that does

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.220
not have the truth.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.020
I think about it this way, as I look at this truth in 1 Peter 3 and verse number 15 to

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.620
be ready to give an answer, I think about it this way, that we ought to live in such

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.980
a way that others will ask questions.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.080
Live your life in such a way, intentional, on purpose, living your life in such a way

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.880
that people will ask questions.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.380
Why do you do what you do?

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.520
Has anyone ever asked you that before?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:20.660
They observe you for a little while in the workplace, maybe a relative, maybe a neighbor,

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.800
and they see you go to church multiple times on Sunday and throughout the week, and they

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.620
see you carrying a Bible with you, and they see you praying over a meal, and they see

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.300
you being concerned about the Lord and about the things of God, and they may say, why do

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.340
you do what you do?

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.780
Be ready to give an answer, always.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.660
The answer is not, well, that's just how I was raised.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.380
You missed an opportunity to speak about the change that the Lord Jesus Christ brought

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.820
in your life, and how He saved your soul, and how He's revealed to you in His Word His

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.220
plan for your life, and how He changed your life and what He's done for you, and you had

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:03.060
no direction, and now you have purpose and direction because of Jesus.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.260
And we're ready to take that conversation immediately to the Lord.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:13.500
We must, as we think about this truth of being ready to give an answer, we must be careful

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:20.780
that we always, in giving an answer, we always, always, always exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:26.220
I am not the hero of my story, and neither are you.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.100
Jesus is the hero of my story.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.020
Paul said it this way, but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.380
Amen?

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.580
If it were not for the grace of God, where would we be?

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.900
Hopeless and helpless without any direction.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.820
See, sometimes if we're not careful, listen, we get around people.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.300
You talk to people long enough, and they want to talk about how wonderful they are.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.740
You ever talk to people like that?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.340
They like to tell you how good they are, right?

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:02.100
Listen, we ought to be wondering about trying to tell people about how good our God is.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.700
Let me tell you what He's done for me.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.000
Let me tell you how He's changed my life.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.240
It's like John the Baptist said, and I've said it often in recent weeks, it's on my

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:16.000
heart, that Christ would increase and we would decrease, that we would have this constant

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.240
approach in giving an answer that we always, always exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.760
And let me also say this, that we always use Scripture.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.680
See, God uses His Word.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.000
There are times in which we can leave a conversation, and we can wonder whether we had any impact

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.200
in that conversation whatsoever.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.520
And I would encourage you that if you use Scripture, that the Holy Spirit of God can

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:48.280
use that in the life of that individual long after you leave that conversation.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.920
He didn't promise to use my words.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.140
He didn't promise to use your words.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.460
But He promised to use His words, amen?

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.120
And so as I use Scripture, that means that I need to know the Scripture if I'm going

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.820
to use the Scripture.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.860
And I use it in those conversations that I give an answer.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.100
Listen, let me tell you what Christ has done for me.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.740
Let me tell you how He's changed my life.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.300
Let me tell you what He's revealed to me in His Word.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.820
We begin to come to that place where, are you ready?

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.980
Are you ready to preach the gospel?

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.140
Are you ready to give an answer?

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.140
Then I would say this, number three, are you ready to meet the Lord?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.140
Are you ready to meet the Lord?

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:35.060
I know that we often speak about the coming of the Lord, and I'm looking forward to hearing

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.260
the trumpet of the Lord sounding, amen?

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.780
I'm looking forward to that.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.340
But the reality is that we need to live in this place where we are ready, truly ready

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.380
to meet the Lord.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:55.300
Look over at the book of Acts, if you will, and using the life of the Apostle Paul, looking

00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:03.100
at a couple of passages here, with this thought of being ready to meet the Lord.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.340
In Acts chapter number 21, Paul's on his way to Jerusalem.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.020
He'd met with the Ephesian elders in Acts 20.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.060
He's now leaving, and he's going on his way to Caesarea in chapter 21.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.520
We find that there's a measure of concern in verse number 5.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.900
We won't take time to read a lot of this, but we find that the people met as he was

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.220
getting ready to depart, and they kneeled down on the shore and prayed, and Paul was

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.220
going to leave.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.340
And the Bible tells us in verse number 11, when he was coming to us, he took Paul's girdle

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.980
and bound his own hands and feet and said, thus saith the Holy Ghost, so shall the Jews

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.520
at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.340
of the Gentiles.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.860
When we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him, that's Paul, not

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.940
to go up to Jerusalem.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.660
They're begging Paul not to go because of what was heard from this certain prophet in

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.660
verse number 10.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.900
Agabus is his name.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.120
We read in verse number 11 of his prophecy, and they're pleading with Paul not to go.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.460
But I want you to notice the answer of the apostle Paul in verse number 13.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.180
Then Paul answered, what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:19.060
Then notice this phrase, for I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.660
for the name of the Lord Jesus.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.020
That's a powerful verse of Scripture.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.180
And Paul says, as he hears the prophecy that Agabus gives and he hears the people pleading

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.380
with him not to go up to Jerusalem, he says, listen, not only am I ready to be bound, but

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.380
I'm ready to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.020
We're familiar with some of those that have gone before us, martyrs of the faith that

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.140
we've referred to them as.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:52.540
We read of Stephen in Acts chapter number 7, and we read of his stoning, and we read

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540
of others.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.100
And obviously we've read books and we've understood.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.600
And one that is very familiar to us is Jim Elliot, but he was not alone in Ecuador when

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.300
they died and all that had taken place.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.420
And I just want to use one illustration from that account.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.060
I read a book years ago about some of that situation.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.820
Of course, Jim Elliot is probably one of the top names that we remember from that group

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.460
of people, but Nate Saint was one of the other men.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.140
And it is said, at least in the book that I read, given the accounts and the details

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.340
of what had transpired, it is said that Nate Saint was warned before they went on that

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.500
what would become their final journey, where they would lose their lives, that it was said

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.740
to Nate Saint, but you might die.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.700
But you might die.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.700
And here's what Nate Saint said, I'm ready to die, but they aren't.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700
Wow.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700
Wow.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.260
What did he mean by that?

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.340
Well, what he meant by that is that he was saved.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.340
He had been born again.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.860
He had been washed in the blood.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.200
He knew that Jesus was his Savior.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.260
He knew that because of his salvation, that if he were to die or when he died, that he

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:14.460
would be absent from the body and be present with the Lord and that he would be with his

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.780
Savior.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.500
He was ready to die.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.500
But they weren't.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500
Why?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500
They hadn't been saved.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.900
They hadn't received the gospel.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.420
They didn't know the truth, that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.420
He didn't know.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.900
Those people didn't know that Jesus Christ, the perfect Lamb of God, the sinless one,

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:42.580
the pure one, the just one, that he went to that old rugged cross and God made him

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.100
to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.460
And they had not understood the truth of the gospel.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.740
They had not received the wonderful news that God loved them and that God died for them.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.300
And he was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.420
And they didn't know that.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.680
And therefore, Nate Saint said, they're not ready to die.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.200
I'm ready because I know the Lord.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.119
Why was Paul able to say, I'm ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.119
for the name of the Lord Jesus?

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:17.880
Well, he was able to say that because he understood.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.080
He said this in the book of Philippians.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.320
He says, for me to live is Christ, but to die is gain.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.080
He said, I'm in a straight betwixt two, having a desire to depart to be with Christ, which

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.960
is far better.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.760
Wow.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:43.080
That's the testimony of a man that had a measure of confidence and understanding that his salvation

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:49.600
was based upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.160
We find that the apostle Paul, he lived in such a way that the Bible says that he lived

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.400
understanding as he would give.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.840
the truth to the believers in Corinth there in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, he says,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.800
we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body to be present with

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800
the Lord.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.760
He lived with a confidence, and therefore it made him ready.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.180
If I'm going to be ready, somebody said this, I didn't say this, I read it somewhere years

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:25.560
and years ago, be ready for the last moment by being ready every moment.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.400
The reality is that I don't know when the last moment's going to be and neither do you.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.840
We have no idea.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.320
The trumpet of the Lord could sound at any moment.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.360
But death could come at any moment as well.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.200
So how am I going to be ready to meet the Lord?

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.360
Well, if you're not saved this morning, I would say this, be sure of your salvation.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.600
How am I going to be ready to meet the Lord?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.440
I must be sure of my salvation, understanding that there's one way to get to heaven, and

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.680
that's the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.040
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.720
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.100
Then we find that Peter would say this in the book of Acts in the fourth chapter, neither

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.520
is there salvation in any other, for there's no other name under heaven given among men

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.800
and whereby we must be saved.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.280
We sing the song, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.640
And I'm so thankful that God's revealed that truth to us.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.440
And so how am I going to be ready to meet the Lord?

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.320
Well, number one, I must be sure of my salvation.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.800
Number two, if you're sure of your salvation, how am I going to be ready to meet the Lord?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.920
I would say this, be steadfast for your Savior.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.360
Be steadfast in serving your Lord.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:53.600
Take the truth that we read there in 2 Samuel 15 and verse number 15, when a human king

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.440
facing some difficult circumstances provides some direction and some instruction to those

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:06.160
servants that serve him, that those servants, they recognize his position as being the king,

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.040
but we as the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, we recognize that he is King of kings and

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.200
Lord of lords.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:18.000
We recognize that he is my master, my Savior, my God, and we come to the place where we

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.880
say, Lord, master, I am your servant and I am ready to do whatsoever you would appoint

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880
me to do.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.120
God, I'm yours fully, completely.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.560
We sing the song, I surrender all.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.840
It's a powerful song.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.720
It's a soul-searching song.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.080
I remember years ago, Ron, having a conversation with you about that song, and Ron's testimony

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:59.400
to me about that song was every time I would sing it, I would think, really, am I all?

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:05.720
If I'd be honest, it's just some, maybe most, but all?

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:17.800
They sang this morning, here am I, Lord, send me, I'm all in, what do you want, Lord,

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800
with my life?

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:30.600
Lord, I understand, you're Lord, you're King, I'm your servant, and I'm ready to do whatsoever

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.800
you tell me to do.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.960
Man, that's a great response from the servants of King David.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:44.480
But as the servants of the Most High God, King of kings and Lord of lords, we too should

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.720
respond in like manner.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.960
Brother Barrett said during Sunday school, after his wife gave the testimony of her parents

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:02.000
being saved and her being saved and speaking about the surrender of his parents, there's

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.720
no telling what God will do in your life and in my life as we just say, Lord, here am I,

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.040
use me.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.360
You say, well, I don't have much to offer God.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.360
That's good, because that means you have a humble view of yourself, and God will use

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.160
that, amen?

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.480
God will use it and multiply it, and God will do in your life and in my life what we could

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:39.380
never ever dream of being accomplished, because Lord, I'm yours, I'm yours.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.080
Are you ready?

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.160
Are you ready to preach the gospel, to give an answer, to meet the Lord?

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160
Let's pray together.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.640
We love you.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.640
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:58.400
God, I thank you for this response of these servants of King David.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.680
Lord, I think about us this morning as your servants.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:10.040
God, I pray that we would be able to say that we're ready to do whatsoever you would instruct

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.160
us to do.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.920
God, help us to be surrendered and yielded.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.680
As we look at some of these examples from the scriptures of what we're to be ready for

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.520
as your people, God, help us to be ready to preach the gospel.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.920
Help us, God, to be ready to give an answer.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.040
Help us, God, to be ready to meet you.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.360
If there's one that's here that's not sure of heaven, oh, God, I pray that today would

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.360
be the day of their salvation.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.160
You'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:48.600
that heaven is their home, not hoping so, not thinking so, but knowing with 100% confidence

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.240
to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.680
God, for every child of yours that's present here this morning, I pray that you'd stir

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680
us up.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.520
God, that you'd help us to be steadfast in our service for you, that we'd keep our eyes

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.520
upon you.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.960
Lord, that we would redeem the time, that we'd be busy about the work that you've called

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.200
us to do, that we would be faithful, surrendered servants.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:19.240
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.960
I pray that each decision that is made would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.680
and impact eternity.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.320
I pray that you'd seal each decision, that they would be decisions that would endure.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.080
Bless now, Lord, and we'll thank you for it.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.320
In Christ's name we pray.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.960
Would you stand with us?
