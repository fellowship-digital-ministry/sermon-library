1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
now for this calendar year, 2025,

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,639
studying through the book of 2 Corinthians

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,680
with our theme, God's Grace is Sufficient.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,520
And I'm so thankful I preached that very first Sunday,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,819
actually it was the last Sunday of December of 2024,

6
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:19,000
the introduction, if you will, to this series.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,719
And there's a promise in 2 Corinthians 12

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,399
and verse number nine that God's grace is sufficient.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,319
It's a promise that needs to be embraced.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,979
It is explained there, but it needs to be embraced

11
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:33,580
by God's people and experienced by God's people

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,500
that God's grace is sufficient.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,900
Well, you'll recall from last week

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,299
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

15
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,139
we looked at verses eight down through

16
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:43,479
the end of the chapter, verse number 18,

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,540
and Paul was speaking with great transparency

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,020
with regard to the ministry and all those things.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,060
And we said this, that when you look at the pressures,

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,340
he says we faint not, we look at the pressures,

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,200
but then we see the provision that God gives his grace

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,819
and God gives his strength and his power

23
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,779
and what a blessing that is.

24
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,500
He ends the fourth chapter by really speaking

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,620
about perspective.

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,419
That's how we ended the message last Sunday morning.

27
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:16,099
And we talked about that perspective of eternal things.

28
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:18,459
He says at the end of the chapter in verse number 18,

29
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:21,300
while we look not at the things which are seen,

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,819
but the things which are not seen

31
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,980
for the things which are seen are temporal,

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,779
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

33
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:33,540
And then immediately after Paul is challenging

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,459
the people of Corinth and after we're being challenged

35
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,220
as we read this letter, this book,

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,099
to have our focus on that which is eternal

37
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,099
instead of that which is temporal,

38
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,000
we find that he immediately turns his attention to heaven.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,019
Why?

40
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,120
Well, because that's eternal.

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,279
And he starts talking about this perspective

42
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,080
and as he's talking about this perspective,

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,519
not looking at the things which are temporal,

44
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,279
but the things which are eternal

45
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,360
and he reaches this high point

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
at the end of chapter number four

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,919
and then we enter into the fifth chapter.

48
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,039
Of course, we know that the chapter divisions

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,039
were added well after and therefore our ease

50
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,679
of being able to find portions of scripture.

51
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,000
And we find here this morning

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
that immediately his attention turns to heaven.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,880
Aren't you thankful for the truth of heaven?

54
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,800
I titled the message this morning the certainty of heaven.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,639
And when we look at this passage of scripture,

56
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,559
we find that there are many that discuss heaven

57
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,100
in the day and age in which we live.

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,300
They acknowledge most will acknowledge

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,600
the existence of heaven and many would say this,

60
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,119
they desire that they would go to heaven.

61
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,839
It's very few people that I've ever spoken to

62
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:47,179
and I ask people often as I have opportunity

63
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,740
to share the gospel and as we go through

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,419
and pass out gospel tracts and knock on doors

65
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,779
and have interactions, divine appointments with individuals.

66
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,559
So often when we have those conversations,

67
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,380
I'll ask a question like this,

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,940
are you 100% sure if you were to die today

69
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,699
that heaven is your home?

70
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,820
And most people respond to me with this kind of a phrase

71
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,940
is I hope so, I think so, I hope so.

72
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,899
I mean, they want to go to heaven.

73
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,699
Very few people that I've ever met

74
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,539
that have not had a desire to go to heaven.

75
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:26,500
And heaven is a subject, a topic that is spoken of often,

76
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,979
but we find that the subject of heaven,

77
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,740
the authority with regard to heaven,

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,020
what it is, where it is, who will go,

79
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,139
the authority is the Bible, it's God's word.

80
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,619
It's not your opinion, my opinion,

81
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:44,100
it's not what some person wrote about,

82
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,139
talked about what you find in some other form of literature.

83
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,259
No, the Bible has the authority.

84
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:54,220
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

85
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,460
we find that the Apostle Paul will reveal to us

86
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,300
some of that which we are familiar with,

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,100
and no doubt the importance of knowing

88
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,899
and having confidence that heaven is not only a real place,

89
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:10,860
but the certainty that we can have as individuals

90
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,619
that heaven is our home.

91
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,179
I'm so thankful, there was a day in my life,

92
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,299
and I think if you're saved here this morning,

93
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,540
if you've trusted Christ as your savior,

94
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,100
there was a day in your life as well

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,299
that you went through life not knowing

96
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,739
if heaven was truly your home.

97
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,260
I remember as a young child,

98
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,980
I didn't get saved until I was 17 years old,

99
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,739
I remember as a young child,

100
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,019
I remember right before I got saved

101
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,820
and as I would drive that road,

102
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,779
I can see it in my mind's eye this morning

103
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,299
as I would drive in Southern California to school

104
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,299
from the military base where my dad was stationed

105
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,619
and I could see and I could see in my mind's eye

106
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:51,140
that hilly terrain and those curvy roads

107
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,299
and I remember having the thought

108
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,739
that if I were to get in a car accident

109
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,100
and go off the side of the road and died,

110
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,980
I did not have certainty that heaven was my home.

111
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,820
I remember that.

112
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,100
Many of us this morning, we remember that.

113
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,140
You know, there's a whole host of people today

114
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,820
that still are in that situation.

115
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,140
They hope.

116
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Most people today acknowledge the reality of death.

117
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:19,540
It's not something that is comfortable

118
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,299
for most people to speak of,

119
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:24,299
but you know that there's an entire industry

120
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,380
that has made, I don't know how much money they have

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,339
on selling life insurance.

122
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,220
Do they not?

123
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,260
They sell life insurance.

124
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,779
I remember talking to a guy that called me

125
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,579
about selling me life insurance.

126
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,940
I said, you know, we kind of talk to people

127
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,100
about the same thing.

128
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
He said, really?

129
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,540
I said, yeah, we talk to people about death,

130
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,619
but you're trying to sell them something

131
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:47,459
that will help somebody else when they die

132
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,859
and I'm trying to talk to them

133
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,820
so that they can know where they're gonna go when they die.

134
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,779
And I said, as a matter of fact,

135
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,500
you talk to people about death all the time

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,820
and you sell life insurance every day of your life.

137
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,459
What's gonna happen when you die?

138
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,459
And he just kind of paused.

139
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,660
A man that sold life insurance for a living,

140
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
a man that talked to people about dying,

141
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,179
that his livelihood was the result of the acknowledgement

142
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,940
and reality that people will die,

143
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,019
had never given thought personally

144
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,700
what would happen to him when he died.

145
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,179
I'd love to tell you that he got saved,

146
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,179
but he really just wanted to make a sale.

147
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,820
He wasn't too interested in hearing the Bible truth

148
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:36,660
about heaven.

149
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,700
This morning, when we look at the word of God,

150
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,859
we find that we can have confidence

151
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,500
and we can have certainty of not only the truth

152
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,140
that heaven is a real place,

153
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,500
but that we that have been born again,

154
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,100
we that have been saved by the blood of Christ,

155
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,179
will get to heaven when we die.

156
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,380
Someone made this comment in my presence just yesterday.

157
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,619
Here's what they said to me.

158
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:05,100
They said, well, they thought I was making something up.

159
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,739
I talked about being a grandparent,

160
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:09,299
and they said, you're too young to be a grandparent.

161
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:12,619
And really, they said that because Holly was with me.

162
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,260
They didn't say that because I look young.

163
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,059
They said that because Holly looks young.

164
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,140
And I know the situation, right?

165
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,019
But they said this in my presence.

166
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,140
They said, now listen, I've been told

167
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,820
that you can go to hell for lying.

168
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,820
But you know the reality is that yes, all men are liars,

169
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,299
and all liars shall have their part

170
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,339
in the lake of fire, Revelation 21.

171
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,179
But the reality is that the reason that someone goes to hell

172
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:36,459
is not because they lied.

173
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,179
It's because they're a sinner,

174
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,059
and they've not trusted Jesus Christ

175
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,739
as their personal savior.

176
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,299
The reason that I'm going to heaven

177
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,980
is not because I deserve it.

178
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,459
It's not because I'm good enough.

179
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,019
It's not because of something I did.

180
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,940
No, it's all because of what Jesus Christ did

181
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,980
on the cross of Calvary.

182
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,700
It's all because of his substitutionary atonement

183
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,779
that he took, and he paid a sin debt that he did not owe.

184
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,339
He paid for my sin, and for your sin,

185
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,579
and for the sin of the world.

186
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:07,980
And he says, I've now offered to you this gift.

187
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
What is the gift?

188
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,540
It's eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

189
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,179
And Paul was a recipient of that gift.

190
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,820
Paul had an amazing experience on the road to Damascus,

191
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,660
and Acts chapter number nine is he's there,

192
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,700
and he's going to persecute those that are Christians,

193
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,220
any that are of this way.

194
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,779
And the Lord Jesus Christ appears to him,

195
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,779
and he says, who art thou, Lord?

196
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,099
What wilt thou have me to do?

197
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,099
And Paul was never the same.

198
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,820
You read Acts chapter number nine,

199
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,460
and in fact, if you read about maybe halfway,

200
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,299
two thirds of the way through the chapter,

201
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,059
you start reading that Paul is preaching the gospel.

202
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,820
He's preaching Christ.

203
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,859
What happened in this guy's life?

204
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,419
Well, he's a new creature.

205
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,419
He'd been saved and born again.

206
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,419
And now he's preaching the gospel.

207
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,179
And then God used the apostle Paul

208
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,260
to go to the city of Corinth.

209
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,419
And he went to the city of Corinth.

210
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,260
You know what he did?

211
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,979
You read 1 Corinthians chapter number one.

212
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,900
He went there not to have people following him.

213
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,099
He went there to preach Christ.

214
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,179
He went there not so that people could look at him

215
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,780
as being this great orator

216
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,659
and having some level of man worship.

217
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,780
No, he went there to preach Christ.

218
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,859
He went there, as he says in Romans chapter number one,

219
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,299
to preach the gospel.

220
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,140
Why?

221
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,500
Because the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

222
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,859
And Paul believed that.

223
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:33,059
I mean, he went everywhere preaching the gospel.

224
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,099
You read his life,

225
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,820
you trace his steps through the New Testament,

226
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,099
and he's preaching the gospel,

227
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,500
and he's preaching the gospel,

228
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,140
and he's taking and seizing those opportunities.

229
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,979
Why?

230
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:47,260
Because he knows the truth of eternity,

231
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,179
and he knows the power of the gospel.

232
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:52,179
This morning, when we first begin reading

233
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,539
chapter number five,

234
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,700
notice what he says,

235
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,179
for we know.

236
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,940
I'm gonna pause there just for a moment.

237
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,700
We're gonna get through the first.

238
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,420
verses this morning. I only have two points. I told somebody that before the

239
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,740
service this morning. I said, well, I only got two points. That doesn't mean

240
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,020
anything, but I only have two points, amen? But it says, for we know. Who are

241
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,260
the we? Who are the we? Well, specifically, contextually, when you think about the

242
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,100
original writing, Paul's not only talking about himself, but he's talking about

243
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,860
those in Corinth. Who are those in Corinth that he's speaking of? Well, he's writing to

244
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,660
a local church. If you turn back to chapter number one, the Bible says this

245
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,980
in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and verse number 1, Paul, an apostle of Jesus

246
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,140
Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, notice, unto the church of

247
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,260
God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia. And so we

248
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,820
find that the apostle Paul, as he's writing, and he says, he addresses in

249
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,020
chapter number 1 who he is writing to, and then in chapter number 5 he says,

250
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,100
for we know. And so he's talking about himself. He didn't say, for I know, though

251
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,460
that's true, but he's speaking and he's talking about them collectively, these

252
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,700
people that make up the church. Now, the church is made up of believers. When we

253
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,140
look at the truth of New Testament Christianity, when we understand church

254
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,180
polity and all of that, we look at the epistles, we understand how does one

255
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,180
become a member of a local church. Over the last almost 14 years now, we've had

256
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,460
almost 50, it's almost 60 now, different family units that have joined

257
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,260
Fellowship Baptist Church. Since I've been here as the pastor, almost 60 family

258
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,980
units have joined the church. I'd like to say that they all still live here, but so

259
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,380
many of them have moved away during that same period of time. And here's the

260
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,500
reality, is that each individual, and several of you I met with you before you

261
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
joined the church, you say this, I want to be a member of Fellowship Baptist

262
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,060
Church. What's one of the first questions that I ask you? Well, tell me about when

263
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,780
you trust that Christ is your Savior. Tell me about your salvation. Tell me

264
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,180
about when you were baptized scripturally. Why? Because the

265
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,980
requirements, if you will, for church membership are that you're saved and

266
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,620
scripturally baptized, and then you join the local church. There's not, it's not a

267
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,580
club. Church isn't a club. The church, there's one way to become a member of

268
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,260
the church, and we find that it's through that being saved. And those that have

269
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,620
placed their faith and trust in Jesus Christ, today there are many that would

270
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,980
have maybe a misunderstanding of what it means to be saved, or what it means to be

271
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,620
born again. And you ask people if they hope that they're going to heaven. What

272
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,020
gives you that hope? Well, I was a member of a church, or I was baptized, or I was

273
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,660
this, or I was that, and so on and so forth. But the reality is that there's

274
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,380
only one way to be saved, and that's through accepting Jesus Christ as your

275
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,380
personal Savior. You can't work for salvation. You're not going to earn

276
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,220
it through your good deeds. No, it's a gift. And we find that Paul, as he's

277
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,220
writing to these believers in Corinth, he says that we know, for we know, for we

278
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,300
know what? Notice he says, as we're going to read the text, he says that if our

279
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,860
earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a

280
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,820
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Do you see how Paul transitions?

281
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,580
I mean, he talked about that eternal perspective at the end of chapter 4, and

282
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,660
immediately his mind goes to eternity. Immediately his mind goes to heaven, and

283
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,460
he says we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle, what's he

284
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,780
talking about? This body. Peter talks about that his tabernacle, he's gonna put

285
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,540
it off. What is he talking about? He's gonna die. And notice Paul says we know

286
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,740
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,060
building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heaven. For in this

288
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,340
we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is

289
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,020
from heaven. How many of you that are saved, you want to go to heaven? Amen.

290
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,100
There are days that you say, man, I groan for it. Paul, when he's writing to the

291
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,779
church at Philippi, right, he said I'm in a straight betwixt two, having a desire

292
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,620
to depart to with Christ, which is far better. That's what he says. But God's

293
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,420
left us here for a purpose, for a reason, we understand that. And he says in verse

294
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,420
number three, if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked, for we that

295
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,300
are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened. Not for that we would be

296
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,980
unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

297
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,940
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing as God, who also hath

298
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,140
given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always confident,

299
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,540
knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. For

300
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,940
we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and willing, rather to

301
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,059
be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. This morning, if

302
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:16,340
you're taking notes, number one, the expectation of every believer. Listen, if

303
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,260
you've placed your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, you ought to have

304
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,980
an expectation of heaven. You ought to live every day understanding that heaven

305
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,420
is certain, that heaven is that reality, and that I expect, listen, we sing the

306
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,779
songs and we talk about seeing our Savior face-to-face, and this is not just

307
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,100
some wishful thinking. No, this is a confidence, this is an earnest

308
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,540
expectation that I have. And if you're here this morning, I actually said

309
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,500
to somebody on the back porch on Wednesday, something was being said, and I

310
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,260
said, listen, we're going to heaven, right? Just kind of get that focus. And it's not

311
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,180
to say that we shouldn't be concerned about anything that's going on around us.

312
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm not saying that we live without any awareness of what's going on around us,

313
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,820
but the reality is that my attention and my expectation is that heaven is my home.

314
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:18,260
What a joy. We find that he says in verse number one, for we know, we know. He says

315
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,500
again in verse number one, we say that he says, we have a building of God and

316
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,900
house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.

317
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,700
We find that Paul is saying to these believers, and even for himself as he's

318
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,620
taking this moment after speaking about the perspective, he's getting caught up

319
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,300
in this expectation that he has, I'm gonna be with my Lord and Savior. We know.

320
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,860
We know. Notice in this portion of scripture is a portion that I enjoy using

321
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,300
at times of having a memorial service, a celebration of life, a funeral, whatever

322
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,660
you want to call it. Why? See, when you have the opportunity to preach a funeral

323
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,820
for somebody that you know was saved and that's in heaven, it's a totally different

324
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,779
situation. I'm telling you, Joe Harrah, if you were here for his memorial service,

325
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,900
it was one of the most exciting services I think we ever had. Just, man, he knows

326
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,220
that he was going to heaven and we were celebrating. We're just worshiping the

327
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,820
Lord. I talk with Brother Curry sometimes. He shares some things with me about,

328
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,860
you know, at my funeral, I want blah, blah, blah, whatever. And those are good

329
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,740
things, good conversations. But, man, it's a celebration. In 2 Corinthians chapter

330
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,779
number five is a portion of scripture along with several others that I enjoy

331
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:50,059
going to. Why? Because of the certainty. For we know, we have. He says in verse

332
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:56,100
number four, notice, for we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.

333
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,140
You can think about what he had just spoken of, the pressures in chapter

334
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,580
number four, and you can relate with Paul as he makes that statement. But notice he

335
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,740
says, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, notice, that mortality

336
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:22,660
might be swallowed up of life. Death isn't the end. Mortality, notice it says,

337
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:30,140
will be swallowed up of life. Not of death, of life. I know I've shared it before, but

338
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,739
it's worth repeating. D.L. Moody is often referenced as saying, one day you're

339
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:44,940
going to read that D.L. Moody died. And he said this, don't believe it for a second.

340
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,059
And then he followed that up with this by saying, in that day I'll be more alive than

341
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:59,100
I've ever been. He's talking about mortality being swallowed up of life. This expectation

342
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,900
that we have, we often will speak of this and we'll look at some of the verses, but

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,500
we talk about some of the truth of heaven and you read in the book of Revelation and

344
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,660
you talk about there'll be no more pain, no more sickness, no more death, no more

345
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:20,940
crying. I mean, those are wonderful realities, the certainties that we have of heaven. Notice

346
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:27,000
in verse number five, the Bible says, now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing

347
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:37,160
is God. Notice this, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Now, what

348
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,359
is he speaking of here? Well, previously in chapter number one of this letter, 2 Corinthians

349
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:49,320
1 and verse 22, he says, who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in

350
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,020
our hearts. And we find that at the moment of salvation, there's many things that happen

351
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,739
at the moment of salvation, but one of them is that the Holy Spirit of God...

352
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:03,379
in dwells the believer.

353
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:07,799
At the moment that I got saved, at the moment that you got saved, if you placed your faith

354
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,739
and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, the finished work of Calvary, his death, his burial, and

355
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:16,899
his glorious resurrection, and you came to him, the Bible says, for whosoever shall call

356
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:22,299
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and you accepted that free gift of eternal

357
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:28,179
life, the Bible teaches us that in that moment, not only are we quickened, we're made alive,

358
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:33,819
we're translated immediately from death unto life, and we find that the Holy Spirit of

359
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:37,219
God indwells us.

360
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:45,459
At the moment you got saved, you got all of the Holy Spirit that you're ever gonna get.

361
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:50,219
The difference is that the Holy Spirit doesn't always have all of us.

362
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:54,779
That's where we talk about the filling of the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 5, and be filled

363
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,939
with the Spirit, and we understand the difference, but he speaks here about giving to us, notice

364
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:06,579
in verse number 5 again, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

365
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,019
Look over at Ephesians, keep your place here in 2 Corinthians, but look at Ephesians just

366
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,939
for a moment, because it's so important that we look at this truth in Ephesians chapter

367
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:22,079
number 1 and understand this powerful truth that leads to this expectation that we have

368
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,199
as saved people.

369
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:29,279
In Ephesians chapter number 1, beginning in verse number 12, the Bible says this, that

370
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,999
we should be to the praise of his glory.

371
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:40,559
Notice this, who first trusted in Christ, and then it says in verse 13, in whom ye also

372
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:48,359
trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

373
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,599
Now pause, I'm gonna come back and read the rest of the verse in just a moment, but

374
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,759
understand that before, listen, we had to hear the gospel before we could be saved.

375
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,919
How shall they be saved, right?

376
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,039
You read for whoso shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, Romans 10 in verse

377
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,239
number 13, how shall they call on him in whom they've not heard?

378
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:12,759
How shall they call or hear on him without a preacher and all of that?

379
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,359
And we understand, listen, we had to hear the gospel.

380
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,359
You had to hear the gospel.

381
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,919
You had to hear that you're a sinner, and that your sin has a penalty, a consequence.

382
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,999
The wages of sin is death.

383
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:29,999
How to become a sinner?

384
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:34,519
I was born a sinner just like everyone else other than the Lord Jesus Christ.

385
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,399
We're born sinners.

386
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:43,879
No one has to teach those kids in the nursery to be selfish, amen?

387
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:48,639
You have children, you've been around children, you know they're born sinners.

388
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:52,599
Even grandchildren, amen, they're born sinners.

389
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,759
But here's the reality.

390
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,079
We recognize that we're sinners and there's a price for sin, but God commendeth his love

391
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:08,039
toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

392
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,039
He died for me.

393
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
He took my place.

394
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,039
And I heard that truth of the gospel, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the

395
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,959
Lord shall be saved, and I heard that message, and when I heard that message, and when these

396
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:27,159
folks in Ephesus heard the message, he says, in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard

397
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,999
the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

398
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:32,999
You have to hear the gospel.

399
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:37,759
That's why we send forth missionaries, so that the gospel will be preached.

400
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,199
That's why we give you gospel tracts.

401
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,079
That's why we have visitation and soul winning on Saturdays at 10 a.m.

402
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,079
Why?

403
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,479
Because we need to go and preach the gospel because they need to hear the truth of the

404
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,479
gospel.

405
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,479
Why?

406
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:52,999
Second Corinthians chapter number four, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

407
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:58,719
are lost, in whom the God of this world, little g, God of this world, hath blinded the minds

408
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:05,199
of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine unto them.

409
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:10,199
So these folks in Ephesus, Paul was used of the Lord to go and to preach the gospel, and

410
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,879
he says, you trusted Christ after you heard.

411
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:21,079
And then notice at the end of verse number 13, in whom also after that ye believed, ye

412
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:30,559
were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is, verse number 14, the earnest of

413
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,440
our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise

414
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,279
of his glory.

415
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,479
We could kind of use the earnest money, down payment, if we could look at that illustration

416
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:47,119
this morning to try to explain this.

417
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,119
And God's given to us the Holy Spirit of promise.

418
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,880
He is the earnest of our inheritance.

419
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,239
Listen, we have an inheritance, if you read first Peter chapter number one, that is undefiled,

420
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:02,639
it's incorrupted, it's reserved in heaven for us.

421
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,639
Praise the Lord.

422
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:09,959
And we find here that as we look at this portion of scripture and we look at the expectation

423
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:16,000
of every believer, why do I, why does Paul, why should these folks in Corinth have this

424
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
expectation?

425
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is it prideful?

426
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've been accused before of being prideful.

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,919
You say, you know that you're going to heaven, that's prideful.

428
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,839
It's not prideful at all, because it has nothing to do with me.

429
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,639
Has everything to do with Jesus.

430
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:31,639
Nothing to do with me.

431
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:32,639
Nothing to do with you.

432
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:33,639
Everything to do with Jesus.

433
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:39,880
Now, I'm thankful that he made me a son, behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed

434
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,759
upon us that we should be called the sons of God.

435
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,559
Read John chapter number one, he came to his own, his own received him not, but as many

436
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,119
as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.

437
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,039
John 1, 11 and 12.

438
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,199
There were some that rejected, but there were some that received.

439
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:07,239
And here, as we look at this expectation, we find that God has given to us, according

440
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:13,479
to 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number five, the earnest of the spirit.

441
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:19,959
Then we come to verse number eight, a verse that is very commonly quoted.

442
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:26,880
We find again, notice the word, we are confident, confident.

443
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
The expectation.

444
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:35,679
He says, we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be

445
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,639
present with the Lord.

446
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:44,039
How often we use those words, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

447
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,479
It's Bible truth.

448
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:52,839
It's the revelation of God, God who has all authority, who knows all things, has given

449
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,279
all scripture by inspiration of God.

450
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,440
We understand that God gave us this truth, and he wants us to have this expectation.

451
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,839
He wants us to know, as Paul says, and as these folks in Corinth for us this morning,

452
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:15,039
that we would know, I hope this morning, that you know for sure that heaven is your home.

453
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,679
I hope this morning that if you are not certain, if you do not have 100% confidence, if you

454
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,440
say, I mean, I really want to go to heaven, I hope I'd go to heaven.

455
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,479
Can I tell you this morning, you can know that heaven is your home.

456
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:33,839
You don't have to go through life hoping and wishing and, no, you can know.

457
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,119
I remember thinking as a young person, I remember thinking, I believe that there was a heaven.

458
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,599
I had no idea how to get there, but I believe there was a heaven.

459
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,440
And I remember thinking as a young person, I sure hope I go to heaven when I die.

460
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,799
But it was a hoping, it was a kind of a wishful thinking.

461
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,519
There was no confidence that I had, and on August 31st, 1997, when I placed my faith

462
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,759
and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, there's been a confidence, an expectation

463
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,119
that God has given me.

464
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,199
I had those thoughts as I would drive to school on that road, my senior year in high school

465
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:14,279
that I shared with you earlier, and I had those thoughts of dying and the uncertainty

466
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,279
and so on and so forth.

467
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,079
But, you know, I drove that road the rest of my senior year, every day to school, and

468
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,079
I never had another fear about it, because God gave me eternal life.

469
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,440
He gave me that gift.

470
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,519
And we have this expectation.

471
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,559
Notice not only the expectation, but can I encourage you this morning, not only the expectation

472
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,239
of every believer, but the excitement of every believer.

473
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,959
Listen, our expectation, heaven with our Savior, should cause us to be excited.

474
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,000
Listen, we're going to heaven.

475
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Amen?

476
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,799
Somebody said it this way, on your worst day, in your worst circumstances, you're still

477
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,640
going to heaven.

478
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,320
Sometimes we don't live like that though, do we?

479
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,839
Sometimes we can live under the circumstances.

480
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,839
Sometimes we can get a real temporal focus, as we see Paul saying not to have at the end

481
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,559
of the fourth chapter.

482
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,479
Sometimes we can be so burdened and so heavy, laden over all the things that we're dealing

483
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:19,599
with and we can lose that perspective.

484
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,640
I would submit to you this morning, that we ought to have excitement every day of our

485
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
lives.

486
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,320
That heaven is my destiny.

487
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,440
It's my destination.

488
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,959
It's where I'm heading.

489
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,719
Think about this, I would ask it maybe this way, how much joy do you have?

490
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:41,760
How much joy do I have, knowing that all these trials, all these hardships, are just

491
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
temporary.

492
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
They're just temporary.

493
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,239
You say, man, it's been a long time.

494
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:49,919
Listen, it's nothing in light of eternity.

495
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,200
Nothing in light of eternity.

496
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,559
Forever and ever and ever and ever I will be with my Lord and my Savior.

497
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,760
And that ought to cause us to have joy and speak.

498
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:09,960
I mean, we ought to be the most excited, happy, joyful people on the face of the earth.

499
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Amen?

500
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,820
And can I tell you, when we're that way, when we live that way, it has an impact on people.

501
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,560
It really does.

502
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,120
Because they deal with some of the same trials that you deal with, and when they see you

503
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,080
struggling and overwhelmed and down and depressed and so on and so forth, they, why do I need

504
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
what you have?

505
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,040
But man, when you can face all those trials in life and say, heaven's my home.

506
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,240
I mean, yeah, there's some things going on.

507
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,640
I mean, there's chaos, there's all sorts of difficulties, but man, I'm going to heaven.

508
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,360
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

509
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Amen?

510
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm not home.

511
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,000
This world, the songwriter said, this world is not my home.

512
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm just passing through.

513
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,920
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.

514
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
You know the song.

515
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,360
What a joy.

516
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,320
The book of Hebrews in chapter 11 and verse 13 makes it this way, that we're strangers

517
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,900
and pilgrims.

518
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm not home.

519
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
You're not home.

520
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,440
But we're going home.

521
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm thankful this morning that this is just temporary, just temporary.

522
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,280
And I understand that in the temporary, I mean, we live in time.

523
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,560
I understand that.

524
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,860
We're bound by time.

525
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,460
But if we can just have that step back and have that eternal perspective, then I'm going

526
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,460
to heaven, going to heaven.

527
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,660
Joy, unspeakable and full of glory, the excitement.

528
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
Let me read some verses to you.

529
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,100
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

530
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,020
And I think that Paul is writing, I wish this morning that we could see really his countenance

531
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,500
as he's writing these words of Scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, that when he talks

532
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,780
about this confidence and this expectation, there's great joy that's just coming from

533
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,140
Paul that he knows that heaven is his home.

534
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,940
He wasn't fearful whatsoever.

535
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,300
He was looking forward with that expectation and he was living with excitement because

536
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,380
heaven was his home in 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

537
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,340
He's writing to the same church and it's the great chapter on the resurrection.

538
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,640
And we find that as we get to the end of the chapter, notice in verse 51, Paul says this

539
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,420
in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 51, behold, I show you a mystery.

540
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,560
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment.

541
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,320
The twinkling of an eye, the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall

542
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,040
be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed.

543
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:46,080
Notice the truth of verse 53, for this corruptible must put on incorruption.

544
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Notice this mortal must put on immortality.

545
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,680
Wow.

546
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,120
This is exciting.

547
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,040
So often when we think about the truth of heaven and we start talking about heaven,

548
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,440
oh man, we get excited.

549
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,560
I preached a message on heaven this morning and it ought to cause the people of God to

550
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,880
be excited, to have joy, knowing that this is my expectation, but what's going to happen

551
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,920
tomorrow and Tuesday and the next day and you're going to go out in the world and you're

552
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,960
going to face all the circumstances and all the hardships and all the difficulties and

553
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,040
all of a sudden what's going to happen is we're going to get our eyes off of heaven

554
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,520
and we're going to get on the temporal things.

555
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,600
And we're going to maybe lose a little bit of that joy, but could I encourage you this

556
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,400
morning that every day of our lives we need to be heavenly focused, eternal perspective.

557
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm going to heaven.

558
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,840
The songwriter said, I'm going to heaven, can't wait.

559
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,160
Man, I hope you feel that way this morning.

560
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,120
I mean, not that you're, you know, dreading life.

561
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,000
No, God gives us opportunities and God gives us these days to be able to serve Him and

562
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,880
to bring Him glory and to be able to tell others about heaven.

563
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,560
Reminded of the truth, not only here at 1 Corinthians chapter 15, but in 1 Thessalonians

564
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,760
chapter number 4, it's a passage of Scripture that deals with the rapture and we find that

565
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:18,000
Paul is seeking to give comfort and information to these believers in Thessalonica, the church,

566
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,440
and he wants to have them also confident of this truth with regard to the return of the

567
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Lord.

568
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
He wants them to be informed.

569
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,279
He does not want them, in fact, he says, I would not have you to be ignorant.

570
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,640
He wants them to be informed.

571
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,520
God wants us to know and we find this wonderful truth in verse number 17.

572
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm not going to read the entirety of the text, but in verse number 17, well, I'll read

573
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
verse 16 with it.

574
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,240
It says, For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice

575
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,040
of the archangel and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

576
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,119
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

577
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,800
to meet the Lord in the air.

578
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:07,200
And then I want you to focus on these last words, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

579
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,839
Is that not exciting?

580
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,880
I mean, this morning, Tim and Holly saying when God is near, my God is near, and yes,

581
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,440
I'm so thankful that we can enter into His presence.

582
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm thankful that the Bible speaks about in the book of Psalms that there is joy in His

583
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,880
presence and we can understand entering into the very presence of God and having that sweet

584
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,600
communion and that sweet fellowship as we get around His word, as we enter into our

585
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,279
prayer closet, as we worship Him in spirit and in truth.

586
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,600
But one day, I'm going to see Him face-to-face, and one day, the Bible tells us that when

587
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:54,040
we meet Him, that we will be with Him forever, forever.

588
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,320
And that changes our perspective, gives us a joy and an excitement that far outweighs

589
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,360
anything that you're going to face this week, anything that you faced last week.

590
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,480
Heaven, heaven is where I'm heading, where I'm going.

591
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:21,640
We find that Jesus, John 14, you're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

592
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,279
I love these verses, and we find that Jesus is speaking to disciples that have hearts

593
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:33,960
that are troubled with regard to what He has revealed to them that would happen in the

594
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,080
days ahead.

595
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,720
We find they have hearts that are troubled, and we find that throughout these few chapters

596
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,520
here in the Gospel of John that Jesus is explaining to them very important truth.

597
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,839
It's expedient for you, He'll say later in this chapter, that I go away.

598
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:50,839
Why?

599
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,839
Because I'm going to send the Spirit.

600
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,240
We talk about the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, and we find that Jesus reveals so many wonderful

601
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,160
promises and truths to them in these chapters.

602
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,960
But when we begin reading chapter 14, Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

603
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,080
Let not your heart be troubled.

604
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,240
You know, it's interesting, for we find in John chapter number 16 and verse number 33,

605
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,880
He says, these things have I spoken unto you that you might have peace.

606
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,520
In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

607
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,200
So He says, let not your heart be troubled.

608
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,279
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

609
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:35,600
Then He goes on to say this, in My Father's house are many mansions.

610
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,200
If it were not so, I would have told you.

611
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,559
And then He makes this statement, I go to prepare a place for you.

612
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,320
Think about that just for a moment.

613
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,640
I go to prepare a place for you.

614
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,160
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again.

615
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,440
We rejoice in the truth that He's coming again.

616
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:09,480
But notice what He says after that, that where I am, there ye may be also.

617
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,800
Is that what your Bible says?

618
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,760
That where I am, Jesus says, our Savior, that where I am, there ye may be also.

619
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,760
And this morning, that ought to give us a great level of excitement, a great level of

620
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
joy.

621
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,800
When we go through life, we have this expectation.

622
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Paul makes it very clear as he's writing to these believers in Corinth, in 2 Corinthians

623
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:40,119
chapter 5, listen, we know, we have this confidence, we're willing, and he gives all of this truth

624
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,559
and it causes us to have this understanding and this expectation, but the reality is what

625
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,679
we understand to be true should impact us, should give us an excitement.

626
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,720
You ever meet someone that's living under the circumstances?

627
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,040
What do I mean by that?

628
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,760
You meet someone that you ask them how they're doing and then you regret it.

629
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,799
I'm just being very transparent this morning.

630
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:09,320
Have you ever had that experience?

631
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I have.

632
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,479
Hey, how's your week?

633
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,479
It's been a week.

634
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,400
Hey, how are you?

635
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Let me tell you, I asked a guy once, I was, man, I was still in college, I was working

636
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,080
my first corporate job, working as I was in college, and I asked this coworker, how are

637
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,479
you?

638
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:30,520
And for like the next hour, he just complained and complained and complained and all of these

639
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,600
problems.

640
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,799
And here's what I said to myself, Ron, I'm never going to ask that guy again how he's

641
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:36,799
doing.

642
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,679
I mean, he was trying to make me depressed.

643
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,679
It was unbelievable.

644
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,760
But then I found out that he said he was a Christian.

645
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
He's just living under the circumstances.

646
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,320
He had no joy.

647
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,520
See, he didn't have that perspective that Paul spoke of at the end of 2 Corinthians

648
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,640
chapter 4, that eternal perspective.

649
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,799
He wasn't living with that.

650
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:05,099
that expectancy that heaven is a real place

651
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,899
and I'm gonna go there not because I deserve to go there

652
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:10,939
but because Jesus, God in flesh died for me

653
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:14,119
and he offered to me this free gift and he saved me

654
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,339
and what a joy and because of that expectation

655
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:22,339
I live now with a joy that I never had before.

656
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,099
I never had that joy before.

657
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,119
Why?

658
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,239
Because the thought of death scared me.

659
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,159
Because I had no idea what was gonna happen.

660
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,159
Then after a little while when I had been in church

661
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,319
and heard some preaching I knew what was going to happen

662
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:42,379
and that was that I had not trust that Christ is my savior

663
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:44,959
and if I died without Christ I would spend eternity

664
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:45,799
in the lake of fire.

665
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,999
I believed that to be true.

666
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:51,079
And I believe that to be true still to this very day.

667
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,839
If you die without Christ you'll spend eternity

668
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:53,899
in the lake of fire.

669
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:58,899
But as the man that said to me yesterday,

670
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:00,499
I heard you could go to hell for lying,

671
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:05,139
can I tell you that God doesn't want anyone to go to hell.

672
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,059
The Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

673
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,299
Some men count slackness but as longsuffering to us

674
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,739
we're not willing that any should perish

675
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,739
but that all should come to repentance.

676
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,379
And this morning maybe someone's here,

677
00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:22,139
maybe someone's tuned in via live stream

678
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:23,379
and they've never been saved.

679
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:26,339
They don't have that expectation and excitement

680
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,619
that we're speaking of this morning

681
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,539
because they've never been saved.

682
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,859
And we love to take a Bible and show you

683
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:34,019
how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

684
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,499
It'd be such a wonderful thing.

685
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,659
In fact, in just another chapter Paul will say this,

686
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,939
that today is the day of salvation.

687
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:45,579
No man knoweth, Proverbs says, what a day may bring forth.

688
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:46,419
Do not delay.

689
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:49,699
If you're not sure of heaven get it settled this morning.

690
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:53,099
But could I talk to the Christians just for a moment?

691
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,219
You're here this morning and you've trusted Christ

692
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,059
as your savior.

693
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,299
Maybe you trust at Christ decades ago.

694
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,619
Maybe you trust at Christ just recently.

695
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,539
But you trust at Christ as your personal savior

696
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:07,019
and you know for sure that heaven is your home.

697
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:08,619
You have that expectation

698
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:12,059
that one day you'll see Christ face to face.

699
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,019
And I just wanna challenge us this morning

700
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:17,219
of how has that affected us?

701
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,739
Has it given us the level of excitement?

702
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,899
Has it given us the joy?

703
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:24,499
Do those that we come in contact with,

704
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:26,179
the people that we work with,

705
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,579
the people that we have social interactions with,

706
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,099
maybe those that we, Joseph playing basketball,

707
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:37,459
we have interactions with a number of people

708
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,259
that don't go to church,

709
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,699
that don't know that heaven is their home.

710
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:44,379
But should they see the joy?

711
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:47,539
Should they see the excitement in my life,

712
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,899
in his life, in Holly's life when they see us there?

713
00:42:50,899 --> 00:42:53,779
How about you and the places that you have

714
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,139
interactions with others?

715
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:58,619
Do they see that there's something different?

716
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,579
You have an excitement.

717
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,139
You know, there's a lot going on in our world,

718
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:03,339
is there not?

719
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:06,499
I mean, seriously, strangers

720
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,619
have approached me and asked me questions

721
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,579
about things that are going on right now in our nation.

722
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,019
Man, what do you think about all this stuff?

723
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,059
We live in Northern Virginia.

724
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:18,299
We're gonna be impacted by a lot of these things, right?

725
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:19,459
I get it.

726
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:21,219
And can I tell you that,

727
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:23,099
this isn't my full statement on this,

728
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,739
there's a lot of things going on,

729
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:27,779
but can I tell you that heaven's my home?

730
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,059
You know, the economy can just be destroyed,

731
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,779
the stock market can fall, it has in the past.

732
00:43:36,899 --> 00:43:38,619
Do you know what the psalmist says?

733
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,019
My God is very present, help in trouble.

734
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:45,419
Though the mountains be, I mean, that's catastrophic.

735
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:48,139
Listen, no matter what happens, I'm going to heaven.

736
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,379
On your worst day, on my worst day, I'm going to heaven.

737
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:57,259
And I wonder this morning, do we have excitement?

738
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,459
Are we living with that joy that heaven is my home?

739
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:06,659
If you're not certain of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible.

740
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:09,539
In fact, we'll have some folks down here this morning

741
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:11,499
that they'd take a Bible if you're a lady,

742
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:12,579
we'll have a lady talk with you.

743
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:14,059
If you're a man, we'll have a man talk with you

744
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:15,939
and have a Bible available to show you

745
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:19,139
what God says in his word about being saved.

746
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:22,619
If you're not sure of heaven, today is the day of salvation.

747
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,099
But for those of us that know Christ as our savior,

748
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,899
live with joy, live with excitement,

749
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:30,619
and have a burden to tell somebody else

750
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,059
that they too can be saved by the grace of God.

751
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:34,899
Let's pray together.

752
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:37,619
Father, how we love you this morning.

753
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,220
We thank you so much for loving us.

754
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,859
We thank you for your word, for the truth of your word.

755
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,299
We thank you for who you are.

756
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:48,699
We thank you for the plan of salvation.

757
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,419
We thank you for the gift of God, which is eternal life.

758
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:53,139
And Father, if there's one here this morning

759
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,899
that's not sure of heaven,

760
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:56,339
oh, it's our prayer that today

761
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:57,619
would be the day of their salvation,

762
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:58,940
that we could take a Bible and show them

763
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,619
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

764
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,539
I pray for every Christian here this morning.

765
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:06,299
God, would you stir us?

766
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,779
God, would you help us to have a burden to reach others?

767
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:13,739
Would you help us to live every day with excitement and joy?

768
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,419
Because this expectation,

769
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:20,699
that which we know to be absent from the body

770
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:23,379
is to be present with the Lord.

771
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:26,059
We ask that you'd move and work as only you can,

772
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,299
and we'll thank you for it.

773
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:28,379
In Christ's name we pray.

774
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:29,619
Would you stand with me?

775
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:30,859
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

776
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:31,699
No one's looking around.

777
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,659
We have an invitation at the end of each of our services

778
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:35,539
for the purpose of allowing people

779
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:38,220
to respond to the message.

780
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,659
Mark is down here this morning.

781
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:40,859
Holly's down here this morning.

782
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,099
If you're a lady, you don't know for sure

783
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,259
that heaven's your home,

784
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:44,220
we'd invite you to come.

785
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,059
We'd never embarrass you,

786
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:47,619
but Holly would meet with you and share with you

787
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,500
what the Bible says.

788
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,899
Mark, if you're a man, he'll meet with you.

789
00:45:50,899 --> 00:45:52,659
Maybe you just want to come and pray.

790
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:53,500
You don't want to thank God

791
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,899
for the salvation that he's given you.

792
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:55,779
Maybe you want to come,

793
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:57,819
there's a burden on your heart for someone

794
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:58,940
that needs to be saved,

795
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,579
and you want to pray that God gives you that opportunity,

796
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:02,419
that you would live.

797
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:03,859
Maybe you acknowledge in your life

798
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:05,859
that you've been living under the circumstances

799
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:08,139
without that eternal perspective.

800
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,819
The altar is open, as Kimberly plays.
