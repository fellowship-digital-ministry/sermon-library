WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
now for this calendar year, 2025,

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:05.639
studying through the book of 2 Corinthians

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.680
with our theme, God's Grace is Sufficient.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.520
And I'm so thankful I preached that very first Sunday,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.819
actually it was the last Sunday of December of 2024,

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:19.000
the introduction, if you will, to this series.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.719
And there's a promise in 2 Corinthians 12

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.399
and verse number nine that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.319
It's a promise that needs to be embraced.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.979
It is explained there, but it needs to be embraced

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.580
by God's people and experienced by God's people

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.500
that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900
Well, you'll recall from last week

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.299
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.139
we looked at verses eight down through

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:43.479
the end of the chapter, verse number 18,

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.540
and Paul was speaking with great transparency

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.020
with regard to the ministry and all those things.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.060
And we said this, that when you look at the pressures,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.340
he says we faint not, we look at the pressures,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.200
but then we see the provision that God gives his grace

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.819
and God gives his strength and his power

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.779
and what a blessing that is.

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.500
He ends the fourth chapter by really speaking

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620
about perspective.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.419
That's how we ended the message last Sunday morning.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.099
And we talked about that perspective of eternal things.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.459
He says at the end of the chapter in verse number 18,

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.300
while we look not at the things which are seen,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.819
but the things which are not seen

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.980
for the things which are seen are temporal,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.779
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.540
And then immediately after Paul is challenging

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.459
the people of Corinth and after we're being challenged

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.220
as we read this letter, this book,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.099
to have our focus on that which is eternal

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.099
instead of that which is temporal,

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.000
we find that he immediately turns his attention to heaven.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.019
Why?

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.120
Well, because that's eternal.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.279
And he starts talking about this perspective

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.080
and as he's talking about this perspective,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.519
not looking at the things which are temporal,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.279
but the things which are eternal

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.360
and he reaches this high point

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000
at the end of chapter number four

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.919
and then we enter into the fifth chapter.

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.039
Of course, we know that the chapter divisions

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.039
were added well after and therefore our ease

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.679
of being able to find portions of scripture.

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.000
And we find here this morning

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
that immediately his attention turns to heaven.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.880
Aren't you thankful for the truth of heaven?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.800
I titled the message this morning the certainty of heaven.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.639
And when we look at this passage of scripture,

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.559
we find that there are many that discuss heaven

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.100
in the day and age in which we live.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.300
They acknowledge most will acknowledge

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.600
the existence of heaven and many would say this,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.119
they desire that they would go to heaven.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.839
It's very few people that I've ever spoken to

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.179
and I ask people often as I have opportunity

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:49.740
to share the gospel and as we go through

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.419
and pass out gospel tracts and knock on doors

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.779
and have interactions, divine appointments with individuals.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.559
So often when we have those conversations,

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.380
I'll ask a question like this,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.940
are you 100% sure if you were to die today

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.699
that heaven is your home?

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.820
And most people respond to me with this kind of a phrase

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.940
is I hope so, I think so, I hope so.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.899
I mean, they want to go to heaven.

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.699
Very few people that I've ever met

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.539
that have not had a desire to go to heaven.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.500
And heaven is a subject, a topic that is spoken of often,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.979
but we find that the subject of heaven,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.740
the authority with regard to heaven,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.020
what it is, where it is, who will go,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.139
the authority is the Bible, it's God's word.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.619
It's not your opinion, my opinion,

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.100
it's not what some person wrote about,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.139
talked about what you find in some other form of literature.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.259
No, the Bible has the authority.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.220
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.460
we find that the Apostle Paul will reveal to us

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.300
some of that which we are familiar with,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.100
and no doubt the importance of knowing

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.899
and having confidence that heaven is not only a real place,

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.860
but the certainty that we can have as individuals

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.619
that heaven is our home.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.179
I'm so thankful, there was a day in my life,

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:18.299
and I think if you're saved here this morning,

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.540
if you've trusted Christ as your savior,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.100
there was a day in your life as well

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.299
that you went through life not knowing

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:26.739
if heaven was truly your home.

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:28.260
I remember as a young child,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.980
I didn't get saved until I was 17 years old,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.739
I remember as a young child,

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.019
I remember right before I got saved

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:35.820
and as I would drive that road,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.779
I can see it in my mind's eye this morning

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.299
as I would drive in Southern California to school

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.299
from the military base where my dad was stationed

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:47.619
and I could see and I could see in my mind's eye

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:51.140
that hilly terrain and those curvy roads

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.299
and I remember having the thought

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:54.739
that if I were to get in a car accident

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.100
and go off the side of the road and died,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.980
I did not have certainty that heaven was my home.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.820
I remember that.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.100
Many of us this morning, we remember that.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.140
You know, there's a whole host of people today

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.820
that still are in that situation.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.140
They hope.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
Most people today acknowledge the reality of death.

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:19.540
It's not something that is comfortable

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.299
for most people to speak of,

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:24.299
but you know that there's an entire industry

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:27.380
that has made, I don't know how much money they have

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.339
on selling life insurance.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.220
Do they not?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.260
They sell life insurance.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.779
I remember talking to a guy that called me

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.579
about selling me life insurance.

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:38.940
I said, you know, we kind of talk to people

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.100
about the same thing.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.100
He said, really?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.540
I said, yeah, we talk to people about death,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.619
but you're trying to sell them something

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.459
that will help somebody else when they die

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:49.859
and I'm trying to talk to them

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:52.820
so that they can know where they're gonna go when they die.

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:56.779
And I said, as a matter of fact,

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.500
you talk to people about death all the time

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.820
and you sell life insurance every day of your life.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.459
What's gonna happen when you die?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.459
And he just kind of paused.

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:09.660
A man that sold life insurance for a living,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.660
a man that talked to people about dying,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.179
that his livelihood was the result of the acknowledgement

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:18.940
and reality that people will die,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.019
had never given thought personally

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.700
what would happen to him when he died.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.179
I'd love to tell you that he got saved,

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:31.179
but he really just wanted to make a sale.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.820
He wasn't too interested in hearing the Bible truth

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:36.660
about heaven.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.700
This morning, when we look at the word of God,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.859
we find that we can have confidence

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.500
and we can have certainty of not only the truth

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.140
that heaven is a real place,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.500
but that we that have been born again,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.100
we that have been saved by the blood of Christ,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.179
will get to heaven when we die.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.380
Someone made this comment in my presence just yesterday.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.619
Here's what they said to me.

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.100
They said, well, they thought I was making something up.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.739
I talked about being a grandparent,

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:09.299
and they said, you're too young to be a grandparent.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:12.619
And really, they said that because Holly was with me.

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:14.260
They didn't say that because I look young.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.059
They said that because Holly looks young.

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:18.140
And I know the situation, right?

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.019
But they said this in my presence.

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:22.140
They said, now listen, I've been told

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.820
that you can go to hell for lying.

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:28.820
But you know the reality is that yes, all men are liars,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.299
and all liars shall have their part

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:32.339
in the lake of fire, Revelation 21.

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:35.179
But the reality is that the reason that someone goes to hell

00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:36.459
is not because they lied.

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.179
It's because they're a sinner,

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:40.059
and they've not trusted Jesus Christ

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.739
as their personal savior.

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:43.299
The reason that I'm going to heaven

00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:44.980
is not because I deserve it.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.459
It's not because I'm good enough.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:48.019
It's not because of something I did.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:50.940
No, it's all because of what Jesus Christ did

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.980
on the cross of Calvary.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.700
It's all because of his substitutionary atonement

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.779
that he took, and he paid a sin debt that he did not owe.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.339
He paid for my sin, and for your sin,

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:03.579
and for the sin of the world.

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:07.980
And he says, I've now offered to you this gift.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.820
What is the gift?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.540
It's eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.179
And Paul was a recipient of that gift.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.820
Paul had an amazing experience on the road to Damascus,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.660
and Acts chapter number nine is he's there,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.700
and he's going to persecute those that are Christians,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.220
any that are of this way.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.779
And the Lord Jesus Christ appears to him,

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:31.779
and he says, who art thou, Lord?

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:34.099
What wilt thou have me to do?

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.099
And Paul was never the same.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.820
You read Acts chapter number nine,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.460
and in fact, if you read about maybe halfway,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.299
two thirds of the way through the chapter,

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:47.059
you start reading that Paul is preaching the gospel.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.820
He's preaching Christ.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.859
What happened in this guy's life?

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:52.419
Well, he's a new creature.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:54.419
He'd been saved and born again.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.419
And now he's preaching the gospel.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:59.179
And then God used the apostle Paul

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:01.260
to go to the city of Corinth.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.419
And he went to the city of Corinth.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:03.260
You know what he did?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.979
You read 1 Corinthians chapter number one.

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:07.900
He went there not to have people following him.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.099
He went there to preach Christ.

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:13.179
He went there not so that people could look at him

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:14.780
as being this great orator

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.659
and having some level of man worship.

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.780
No, he went there to preach Christ.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.859
He went there, as he says in Romans chapter number one,

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:24.299
to preach the gospel.

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:25.140
Why?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.500
Because the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.859
And Paul believed that.

00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:33.059
I mean, he went everywhere preaching the gospel.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.099
You read his life,

00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:36.820
you trace his steps through the New Testament,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.099
and he's preaching the gospel,

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:39.500
and he's preaching the gospel,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.140
and he's taking and seizing those opportunities.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.979
Why?

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:47.260
Because he knows the truth of eternity,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.179
and he knows the power of the gospel.

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:52.179
This morning, when we first begin reading

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:53.539
chapter number five,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.700
notice what he says,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.179
for we know.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:58.940
I'm gonna pause there just for a moment.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.700
We're gonna get through the first.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.420
verses this morning. I only have two points. I told somebody that before the

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.740
service this morning. I said, well, I only got two points. That doesn't mean

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.020
anything, but I only have two points, amen? But it says, for we know. Who are

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:19.260
the we? Who are the we? Well, specifically, contextually, when you think about the

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.100
original writing, Paul's not only talking about himself, but he's talking about

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.860
those in Corinth. Who are those in Corinth that he's speaking of? Well, he's writing to

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.660
a local church. If you turn back to chapter number one, the Bible says this

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.980
in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and verse number 1, Paul, an apostle of Jesus

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:41.140
Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, notice, unto the church of

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.260
God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia. And so we

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.820
find that the apostle Paul, as he's writing, and he says, he addresses in

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.020
chapter number 1 who he is writing to, and then in chapter number 5 he says,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.100
for we know. And so he's talking about himself. He didn't say, for I know, though

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.460
that's true, but he's speaking and he's talking about them collectively, these

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.700
people that make up the church. Now, the church is made up of believers. When we

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.140
look at the truth of New Testament Christianity, when we understand church

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.180
polity and all of that, we look at the epistles, we understand how does one

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:26.180
become a member of a local church. Over the last almost 14 years now, we've had

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:31.460
almost 50, it's almost 60 now, different family units that have joined

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.260
Fellowship Baptist Church. Since I've been here as the pastor, almost 60 family

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.980
units have joined the church. I'd like to say that they all still live here, but so

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.380
many of them have moved away during that same period of time. And here's the

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.500
reality, is that each individual, and several of you I met with you before you

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.500
joined the church, you say this, I want to be a member of Fellowship Baptist

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.060
Church. What's one of the first questions that I ask you? Well, tell me about when

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.780
you trust that Christ is your Savior. Tell me about your salvation. Tell me

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.180
about when you were baptized scripturally. Why? Because the

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.980
requirements, if you will, for church membership are that you're saved and

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:17.620
scripturally baptized, and then you join the local church. There's not, it's not a

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.580
club. Church isn't a club. The church, there's one way to become a member of

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.260
the church, and we find that it's through that being saved. And those that have

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.620
placed their faith and trust in Jesus Christ, today there are many that would

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.980
have maybe a misunderstanding of what it means to be saved, or what it means to be

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.620
born again. And you ask people if they hope that they're going to heaven. What

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.020
gives you that hope? Well, I was a member of a church, or I was baptized, or I was

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.660
this, or I was that, and so on and so forth. But the reality is that there's

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.380
only one way to be saved, and that's through accepting Jesus Christ as your

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.380
personal Savior. You can't work for salvation. You're not going to earn

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.220
it through your good deeds. No, it's a gift. And we find that Paul, as he's

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.220
writing to these believers in Corinth, he says that we know, for we know, for we

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.300
know what? Notice he says, as we're going to read the text, he says that if our

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.860
earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.820
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Do you see how Paul transitions?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.580
I mean, he talked about that eternal perspective at the end of chapter 4, and

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.660
immediately his mind goes to eternity. Immediately his mind goes to heaven, and

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.460
he says we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle, what's he

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.780
talking about? This body. Peter talks about that his tabernacle, he's gonna put

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.540
it off. What is he talking about? He's gonna die. And notice Paul says we know

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.740
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.060
building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heaven. For in this

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:03.340
we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.020
from heaven. How many of you that are saved, you want to go to heaven? Amen.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:14.100
There are days that you say, man, I groan for it. Paul, when he's writing to the

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.779
church at Philippi, right, he said I'm in a straight betwixt two, having a desire

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:26.620
to depart to with Christ, which is far better. That's what he says. But God's

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.420
left us here for a purpose, for a reason, we understand that. And he says in verse

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.420
number three, if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked, for we that

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:40.300
are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened. Not for that we would be

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.980
unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.940
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing as God, who also hath

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:55.140
given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always confident,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.540
knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. For

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.940
we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and willing, rather to

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.059
be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. This morning, if

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:16.340
you're taking notes, number one, the expectation of every believer. Listen, if

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.260
you've placed your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, you ought to have

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.980
an expectation of heaven. You ought to live every day understanding that heaven

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:30.420
is certain, that heaven is that reality, and that I expect, listen, we sing the

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.779
songs and we talk about seeing our Savior face-to-face, and this is not just

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:39.100
some wishful thinking. No, this is a confidence, this is an earnest

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.540
expectation that I have. And if you're here this morning, I actually said

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.500
to somebody on the back porch on Wednesday, something was being said, and I

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.260
said, listen, we're going to heaven, right? Just kind of get that focus. And it's not

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.180
to say that we shouldn't be concerned about anything that's going on around us.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.640
I'm not saying that we live without any awareness of what's going on around us,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.820
but the reality is that my attention and my expectation is that heaven is my home.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:18.260
What a joy. We find that he says in verse number one, for we know, we know. He says

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:24.500
again in verse number one, we say that he says, we have a building of God and

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.900
house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.700
We find that Paul is saying to these believers, and even for himself as he's

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.620
taking this moment after speaking about the perspective, he's getting caught up

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.300
in this expectation that he has, I'm gonna be with my Lord and Savior. We know.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:55.860
We know. Notice in this portion of scripture is a portion that I enjoy using

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.300
at times of having a memorial service, a celebration of life, a funeral, whatever

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.660
you want to call it. Why? See, when you have the opportunity to preach a funeral

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.820
for somebody that you know was saved and that's in heaven, it's a totally different

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:15.779
situation. I'm telling you, Joe Harrah, if you were here for his memorial service,

00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:21.900
it was one of the most exciting services I think we ever had. Just, man, he knows

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.220
that he was going to heaven and we were celebrating. We're just worshiping the

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.820
Lord. I talk with Brother Curry sometimes. He shares some things with me about,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.860
you know, at my funeral, I want blah, blah, blah, whatever. And those are good

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.740
things, good conversations. But, man, it's a celebration. In 2 Corinthians chapter

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.779
number five is a portion of scripture along with several others that I enjoy

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:50.059
going to. Why? Because of the certainty. For we know, we have. He says in verse

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:56.100
number four, notice, for we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.140
You can think about what he had just spoken of, the pressures in chapter

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.580
number four, and you can relate with Paul as he makes that statement. But notice he

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:10.740
says, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, notice, that mortality

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:22.660
might be swallowed up of life. Death isn't the end. Mortality, notice it says,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:30.140
will be swallowed up of life. Not of death, of life. I know I've shared it before, but

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.739
it's worth repeating. D.L. Moody is often referenced as saying, one day you're

00:18:36.739 --> 00:18:44.940
going to read that D.L. Moody died. And he said this, don't believe it for a second.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.059
And then he followed that up with this by saying, in that day I'll be more alive than

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:59.100
I've ever been. He's talking about mortality being swallowed up of life. This expectation

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.900
that we have, we often will speak of this and we'll look at some of the verses, but

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.500
we talk about some of the truth of heaven and you read in the book of Revelation and

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.660
you talk about there'll be no more pain, no more sickness, no more death, no more

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:20.940
crying. I mean, those are wonderful realities, the certainties that we have of heaven. Notice

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.000
in verse number five, the Bible says, now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:37.160
is God. Notice this, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Now, what

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.359
is he speaking of here? Well, previously in chapter number one of this letter, 2 Corinthians

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:49.320
1 and verse 22, he says, who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.020
our hearts. And we find that at the moment of salvation, there's many things that happen

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.739
at the moment of salvation, but one of them is that the Holy Spirit of God...

00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:03.379
in dwells the believer.

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:07.799
At the moment that I got saved, at the moment that you got saved, if you placed your faith

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:12.739
and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, the finished work of Calvary, his death, his burial, and

00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:16.899
his glorious resurrection, and you came to him, the Bible says, for whosoever shall call

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:22.299
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and you accepted that free gift of eternal

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:28.179
life, the Bible teaches us that in that moment, not only are we quickened, we're made alive,

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:33.819
we're translated immediately from death unto life, and we find that the Holy Spirit of

00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:37.219
God indwells us.

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:45.459
At the moment you got saved, you got all of the Holy Spirit that you're ever gonna get.

00:20:45.459 --> 00:20:50.219
The difference is that the Holy Spirit doesn't always have all of us.

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:54.779
That's where we talk about the filling of the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 5, and be filled

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:59.939
with the Spirit, and we understand the difference, but he speaks here about giving to us, notice

00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:06.579
in verse number 5 again, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:10.019
Look over at Ephesians, keep your place here in 2 Corinthians, but look at Ephesians just

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:13.939
for a moment, because it's so important that we look at this truth in Ephesians chapter

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:22.079
number 1 and understand this powerful truth that leads to this expectation that we have

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:25.199
as saved people.

00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:29.279
In Ephesians chapter number 1, beginning in verse number 12, the Bible says this, that

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:32.999
we should be to the praise of his glory.

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:40.559
Notice this, who first trusted in Christ, and then it says in verse 13, in whom ye also

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:48.359
trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:51.599
Now pause, I'm gonna come back and read the rest of the verse in just a moment, but

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:57.759
understand that before, listen, we had to hear the gospel before we could be saved.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.919
How shall they be saved, right?

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:05.039
You read for whoso shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, Romans 10 in verse

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.239
number 13, how shall they call on him in whom they've not heard?

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:12.759
How shall they call or hear on him without a preacher and all of that?

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:16.359
And we understand, listen, we had to hear the gospel.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:17.359
You had to hear the gospel.

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:24.919
You had to hear that you're a sinner, and that your sin has a penalty, a consequence.

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:28.999
The wages of sin is death.

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:29.999
How to become a sinner?

00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:34.519
I was born a sinner just like everyone else other than the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.399
We're born sinners.

00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:43.879
No one has to teach those kids in the nursery to be selfish, amen?

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:48.639
You have children, you've been around children, you know they're born sinners.

00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:52.599
Even grandchildren, amen, they're born sinners.

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:55.759
But here's the reality.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:23:01.079
We recognize that we're sinners and there's a price for sin, but God commendeth his love

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:08.039
toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.039
He died for me.

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.799
He took my place.

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:14.039
And I heard that truth of the gospel, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:20.959
Lord shall be saved, and I heard that message, and when I heard that message, and when these

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:27.159
folks in Ephesus heard the message, he says, in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard

00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:31.999
the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

00:23:31.999 --> 00:23:32.999
You have to hear the gospel.

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:37.759
That's why we send forth missionaries, so that the gospel will be preached.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:39.199
That's why we give you gospel tracts.

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:43.079
That's why we have visitation and soul winning on Saturdays at 10 a.m.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:44.079
Why?

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:47.479
Because we need to go and preach the gospel because they need to hear the truth of the

00:23:47.479 --> 00:23:48.479
gospel.

00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:49.479
Why?

00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:52.999
Second Corinthians chapter number four, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:58.719
are lost, in whom the God of this world, little g, God of this world, hath blinded the minds

00:23:58.719 --> 00:24:05.199
of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine unto them.

00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:10.199
So these folks in Ephesus, Paul was used of the Lord to go and to preach the gospel, and

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:14.879
he says, you trusted Christ after you heard.

00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:21.079
And then notice at the end of verse number 13, in whom also after that ye believed, ye

00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:30.559
were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is, verse number 14, the earnest of

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:37.440
our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.279
of his glory.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:44.479
We could kind of use the earnest money, down payment, if we could look at that illustration

00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:47.119
this morning to try to explain this.

00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:51.119
And God's given to us the Holy Spirit of promise.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:52.880
He is the earnest of our inheritance.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.239
Listen, we have an inheritance, if you read first Peter chapter number one, that is undefiled,

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:02.639
it's incorrupted, it's reserved in heaven for us.

00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:04.639
Praise the Lord.

00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:09.959
And we find here that as we look at this portion of scripture and we look at the expectation

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:16.000
of every believer, why do I, why does Paul, why should these folks in Corinth have this

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
expectation?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Is it prideful?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I've been accused before of being prideful.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.919
You say, you know that you're going to heaven, that's prideful.

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:26.839
It's not prideful at all, because it has nothing to do with me.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:30.639
Has everything to do with Jesus.

00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:31.639
Nothing to do with me.

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:32.639
Nothing to do with you.

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:33.639
Everything to do with Jesus.

00:25:33.639 --> 00:25:39.880
Now, I'm thankful that he made me a son, behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.759
upon us that we should be called the sons of God.

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:48.559
Read John chapter number one, he came to his own, his own received him not, but as many

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:53.119
as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:56.039
John 1, 11 and 12.

00:25:56.039 --> 00:26:00.199
There were some that rejected, but there were some that received.

00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:07.239
And here, as we look at this expectation, we find that God has given to us, according

00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:13.479
to 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number five, the earnest of the spirit.

00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:19.959
Then we come to verse number eight, a verse that is very commonly quoted.

00:26:19.959 --> 00:26:26.880
We find again, notice the word, we are confident, confident.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880
The expectation.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:35.679
He says, we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:38.639
present with the Lord.

00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:44.039
How often we use those words, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:46.479
It's Bible truth.

00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:52.839
It's the revelation of God, God who has all authority, who knows all things, has given

00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:55.279
all scripture by inspiration of God.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:01.440
We understand that God gave us this truth, and he wants us to have this expectation.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.839
He wants us to know, as Paul says, and as these folks in Corinth for us this morning,

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:15.039
that we would know, I hope this morning, that you know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:21.679
I hope this morning that if you are not certain, if you do not have 100% confidence, if you

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:25.440
say, I mean, I really want to go to heaven, I hope I'd go to heaven.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.479
Can I tell you this morning, you can know that heaven is your home.

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:33.839
You don't have to go through life hoping and wishing and, no, you can know.

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:39.119
I remember thinking as a young person, I remember thinking, I believe that there was a heaven.

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:42.599
I had no idea how to get there, but I believe there was a heaven.

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:48.440
And I remember thinking as a young person, I sure hope I go to heaven when I die.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.799
But it was a hoping, it was a kind of a wishful thinking.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:57.519
There was no confidence that I had, and on August 31st, 1997, when I placed my faith

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:02.759
and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, there's been a confidence, an expectation

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:05.119
that God has given me.

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:10.199
I had those thoughts as I would drive to school on that road, my senior year in high school

00:28:10.199 --> 00:28:14.279
that I shared with you earlier, and I had those thoughts of dying and the uncertainty

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.279
and so on and so forth.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:20.079
But, you know, I drove that road the rest of my senior year, every day to school, and

00:28:20.079 --> 00:28:25.079
I never had another fear about it, because God gave me eternal life.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:27.440
He gave me that gift.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.519
And we have this expectation.

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:34.559
Notice not only the expectation, but can I encourage you this morning, not only the expectation

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:37.239
of every believer, but the excitement of every believer.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:41.959
Listen, our expectation, heaven with our Savior, should cause us to be excited.

00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:44.000
Listen, we're going to heaven.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Amen?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.799
Somebody said it this way, on your worst day, in your worst circumstances, you're still

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:54.640
going to heaven.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.320
Sometimes we don't live like that though, do we?

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.839
Sometimes we can live under the circumstances.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:06.839
Sometimes we can get a real temporal focus, as we see Paul saying not to have at the end

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:08.559
of the fourth chapter.

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:14.479
Sometimes we can be so burdened and so heavy, laden over all the things that we're dealing

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:19.599
with and we can lose that perspective.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:25.640
I would submit to you this morning, that we ought to have excitement every day of our

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640
lives.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.320
That heaven is my destiny.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.440
It's my destination.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.959
It's where I'm heading.

00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:35.719
Think about this, I would ask it maybe this way, how much joy do you have?

00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:41.760
How much joy do I have, knowing that all these trials, all these hardships, are just

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760
temporary.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760
They're just temporary.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.239
You say, man, it's been a long time.

00:29:46.239 --> 00:29:49.919
Listen, it's nothing in light of eternity.

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:52.200
Nothing in light of eternity.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:58.559
Forever and ever and ever and ever I will be with my Lord and my Savior.

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:00.760
And that ought to cause us to have joy and speak.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:09.960
I mean, we ought to be the most excited, happy, joyful people on the face of the earth.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.960
Amen?

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.820
And can I tell you, when we're that way, when we live that way, it has an impact on people.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.560
It really does.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.120
Because they deal with some of the same trials that you deal with, and when they see you

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:28.080
struggling and overwhelmed and down and depressed and so on and so forth, they, why do I need

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080
what you have?

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.040
But man, when you can face all those trials in life and say, heaven's my home.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.240
I mean, yeah, there's some things going on.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.640
I mean, there's chaos, there's all sorts of difficulties, but man, I'm going to heaven.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.360
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360
Amen?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.760
I'm not home.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.000
This world, the songwriter said, this world is not my home.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.200
I'm just passing through.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.920
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920
You know the song.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.360
What a joy.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:06.320
The book of Hebrews in chapter 11 and verse 13 makes it this way, that we're strangers

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.900
and pilgrims.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.400
I'm not home.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400
You're not home.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.440
But we're going home.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:20.040
I'm thankful this morning that this is just temporary, just temporary.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.280
And I understand that in the temporary, I mean, we live in time.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.560
I understand that.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.860
We're bound by time.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.460
But if we can just have that step back and have that eternal perspective, then I'm going

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.460
to heaven, going to heaven.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.660
Joy, unspeakable and full of glory, the excitement.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.660
Let me read some verses to you.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.100
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.020
And I think that Paul is writing, I wish this morning that we could see really his countenance

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.500
as he's writing these words of Scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, that when he talks

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.780
about this confidence and this expectation, there's great joy that's just coming from

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.140
Paul that he knows that heaven is his home.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.940
He wasn't fearful whatsoever.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.300
He was looking forward with that expectation and he was living with excitement because

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.380
heaven was his home in 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:16.340
He's writing to the same church and it's the great chapter on the resurrection.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.640
And we find that as we get to the end of the chapter, notice in verse 51, Paul says this

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.420
in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 51, behold, I show you a mystery.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.560
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.320
The twinkling of an eye, the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.040
be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:46.080
Notice the truth of verse 53, for this corruptible must put on incorruption.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.560
Notice this mortal must put on immortality.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.680
Wow.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.120
This is exciting.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.040
So often when we think about the truth of heaven and we start talking about heaven,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.440
oh man, we get excited.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.560
I preached a message on heaven this morning and it ought to cause the people of God to

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.880
be excited, to have joy, knowing that this is my expectation, but what's going to happen

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.920
tomorrow and Tuesday and the next day and you're going to go out in the world and you're

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.960
going to face all the circumstances and all the hardships and all the difficulties and

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.040
all of a sudden what's going to happen is we're going to get our eyes off of heaven

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.520
and we're going to get on the temporal things.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.600
And we're going to maybe lose a little bit of that joy, but could I encourage you this

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.400
morning that every day of our lives we need to be heavenly focused, eternal perspective.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.520
I'm going to heaven.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.840
The songwriter said, I'm going to heaven, can't wait.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.160
Man, I hope you feel that way this morning.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.120
I mean, not that you're, you know, dreading life.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.000
No, God gives us opportunities and God gives us these days to be able to serve Him and

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.880
to bring Him glory and to be able to tell others about heaven.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.560
Reminded of the truth, not only here at 1 Corinthians chapter 15, but in 1 Thessalonians

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.760
chapter number 4, it's a passage of Scripture that deals with the rapture and we find that

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:18.000
Paul is seeking to give comfort and information to these believers in Thessalonica, the church,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.440
and he wants to have them also confident of this truth with regard to the return of the

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440
Lord.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440
He wants them to be informed.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.279
He does not want them, in fact, he says, I would not have you to be ignorant.

00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:31.640
He wants them to be informed.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.520
God wants us to know and we find this wonderful truth in verse number 17.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.320
I'm not going to read the entirety of the text, but in verse number 17, well, I'll read

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.320
verse 16 with it.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.240
It says, For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.040
of the archangel and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.119
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.800
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:07.200
And then I want you to focus on these last words, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.839
Is that not exciting?

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.880
I mean, this morning, Tim and Holly saying when God is near, my God is near, and yes,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.440
I'm so thankful that we can enter into His presence.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.600
I'm thankful that the Bible speaks about in the book of Psalms that there is joy in His

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:30.880
presence and we can understand entering into the very presence of God and having that sweet

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.600
communion and that sweet fellowship as we get around His word, as we enter into our

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.279
prayer closet, as we worship Him in spirit and in truth.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.600
But one day, I'm going to see Him face-to-face, and one day, the Bible tells us that when

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:54.040
we meet Him, that we will be with Him forever, forever.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:01.320
And that changes our perspective, gives us a joy and an excitement that far outweighs

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.360
anything that you're going to face this week, anything that you faced last week.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.480
Heaven, heaven is where I'm heading, where I'm going.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:21.640
We find that Jesus, John 14, you're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:29.279
I love these verses, and we find that Jesus is speaking to disciples that have hearts

00:36:29.279 --> 00:36:33.960
that are troubled with regard to what He has revealed to them that would happen in the

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.080
days ahead.

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:40.720
We find they have hearts that are troubled, and we find that throughout these few chapters

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:46.520
here in the Gospel of John that Jesus is explaining to them very important truth.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.839
It's expedient for you, He'll say later in this chapter, that I go away.

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:50.839
Why?

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:51.839
Because I'm going to send the Spirit.

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:58.240
We talk about the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, and we find that Jesus reveals so many wonderful

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.160
promises and truths to them in these chapters.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:07.960
But when we begin reading chapter 14, Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.080
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.240
You know, it's interesting, for we find in John chapter number 16 and verse number 33,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.880
He says, these things have I spoken unto you that you might have peace.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.520
In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.200
So He says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.279
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:35.600
Then He goes on to say this, in My Father's house are many mansions.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.200
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:45.559
And then He makes this statement, I go to prepare a place for you.

00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:47.320
Think about that just for a moment.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.640
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:00.160
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.440
We rejoice in the truth that He's coming again.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:09.480
But notice what He says after that, that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.800
Is that what your Bible says?

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.760
That where I am, Jesus says, our Savior, that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.760
And this morning, that ought to give us a great level of excitement, a great level of

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.760
joy.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.800
When we go through life, we have this expectation.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.600
Paul makes it very clear as he's writing to these believers in Corinth, in 2 Corinthians

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:40.119
chapter 5, listen, we know, we have this confidence, we're willing, and he gives all of this truth

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:46.559
and it causes us to have this understanding and this expectation, but the reality is what

00:38:46.559 --> 00:38:52.679
we understand to be true should impact us, should give us an excitement.

00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:56.720
You ever meet someone that's living under the circumstances?

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.040
What do I mean by that?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:05.760
You meet someone that you ask them how they're doing and then you regret it.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.799
I'm just being very transparent this morning.

00:39:07.799 --> 00:39:09.320
Have you ever had that experience?

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320
I have.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.479
Hey, how's your week?

00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:12.479
It's been a week.

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:14.400
Hey, how are you?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.000
Let me tell you, I asked a guy once, I was, man, I was still in college, I was working

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.080
my first corporate job, working as I was in college, and I asked this coworker, how are

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.479
you?

00:39:24.479 --> 00:39:30.520
And for like the next hour, he just complained and complained and complained and all of these

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.600
problems.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.799
And here's what I said to myself, Ron, I'm never going to ask that guy again how he's

00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:36.799
doing.

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:40.679
I mean, he was trying to make me depressed.

00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:41.679
It was unbelievable.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.760
But then I found out that he said he was a Christian.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.760
He's just living under the circumstances.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.320
He had no joy.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:57.520
See, he didn't have that perspective that Paul spoke of at the end of 2 Corinthians

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.640
chapter 4, that eternal perspective.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.799
He wasn't living with that.

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:05.099
that expectancy that heaven is a real place

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:07.899
and I'm gonna go there not because I deserve to go there

00:40:07.899 --> 00:40:10.939
but because Jesus, God in flesh died for me

00:40:10.939 --> 00:40:14.119
and he offered to me this free gift and he saved me

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:17.339
and what a joy and because of that expectation

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:22.339
I live now with a joy that I never had before.

00:40:23.959 --> 00:40:26.099
I never had that joy before.

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:27.119
Why?

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.239
Because the thought of death scared me.

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:33.159
Because I had no idea what was gonna happen.

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:36.159
Then after a little while when I had been in church

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:39.319
and heard some preaching I knew what was going to happen

00:40:39.319 --> 00:40:42.379
and that was that I had not trust that Christ is my savior

00:40:42.379 --> 00:40:44.959
and if I died without Christ I would spend eternity

00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:45.799
in the lake of fire.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:47.999
I believed that to be true.

00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:51.079
And I believe that to be true still to this very day.

00:40:51.079 --> 00:40:52.839
If you die without Christ you'll spend eternity

00:40:52.839 --> 00:40:53.899
in the lake of fire.

00:40:55.919 --> 00:40:58.899
But as the man that said to me yesterday,

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:00.499
I heard you could go to hell for lying,

00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:05.139
can I tell you that God doesn't want anyone to go to hell.

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:09.059
The Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:11.299
Some men count slackness but as longsuffering to us

00:41:11.299 --> 00:41:14.739
we're not willing that any should perish

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:17.739
but that all should come to repentance.

00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:20.379
And this morning maybe someone's here,

00:41:20.379 --> 00:41:22.139
maybe someone's tuned in via live stream

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:23.379
and they've never been saved.

00:41:23.379 --> 00:41:26.339
They don't have that expectation and excitement

00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:27.619
that we're speaking of this morning

00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:29.539
because they've never been saved.

00:41:29.539 --> 00:41:30.859
And we love to take a Bible and show you

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:34.019
how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:35.499
It'd be such a wonderful thing.

00:41:35.499 --> 00:41:38.659
In fact, in just another chapter Paul will say this,

00:41:38.659 --> 00:41:41.939
that today is the day of salvation.

00:41:41.939 --> 00:41:45.579
No man knoweth, Proverbs says, what a day may bring forth.

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:46.419
Do not delay.

00:41:46.419 --> 00:41:49.699
If you're not sure of heaven get it settled this morning.

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:53.099
But could I talk to the Christians just for a moment?

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:56.219
You're here this morning and you've trusted Christ

00:41:56.219 --> 00:41:57.059
as your savior.

00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:59.299
Maybe you trust at Christ decades ago.

00:42:01.059 --> 00:42:03.619
Maybe you trust at Christ just recently.

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:05.539
But you trust at Christ as your personal savior

00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:07.019
and you know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:42:07.019 --> 00:42:08.619
You have that expectation

00:42:09.459 --> 00:42:12.059
that one day you'll see Christ face to face.

00:42:12.059 --> 00:42:14.019
And I just wanna challenge us this morning

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:17.219
of how has that affected us?

00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:19.739
Has it given us the level of excitement?

00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:21.899
Has it given us the joy?

00:42:21.899 --> 00:42:24.499
Do those that we come in contact with,

00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:26.179
the people that we work with,

00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:29.579
the people that we have social interactions with,

00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:34.099
maybe those that we, Joseph playing basketball,

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:37.459
we have interactions with a number of people

00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:39.259
that don't go to church,

00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:41.699
that don't know that heaven is their home.

00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:44.379
But should they see the joy?

00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:47.539
Should they see the excitement in my life,

00:42:47.539 --> 00:42:50.899
in his life, in Holly's life when they see us there?

00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:53.779
How about you and the places that you have

00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:55.139
interactions with others?

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:58.619
Do they see that there's something different?

00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.579
You have an excitement.

00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:02.139
You know, there's a lot going on in our world,

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:03.339
is there not?

00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:06.499
I mean, seriously, strangers

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:10.619
have approached me and asked me questions

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:13.579
about things that are going on right now in our nation.

00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:15.019
Man, what do you think about all this stuff?

00:43:15.019 --> 00:43:16.059
We live in Northern Virginia.

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:18.299
We're gonna be impacted by a lot of these things, right?

00:43:18.299 --> 00:43:19.459
I get it.

00:43:19.459 --> 00:43:21.219
And can I tell you that,

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:23.099
this isn't my full statement on this,

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:24.739
there's a lot of things going on,

00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:27.779
but can I tell you that heaven's my home?

00:43:29.659 --> 00:43:32.059
You know, the economy can just be destroyed,

00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:34.779
the stock market can fall, it has in the past.

00:43:36.899 --> 00:43:38.619
Do you know what the psalmist says?

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:41.019
My God is very present, help in trouble.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:45.419
Though the mountains be, I mean, that's catastrophic.

00:43:45.419 --> 00:43:48.139
Listen, no matter what happens, I'm going to heaven.

00:43:48.139 --> 00:43:51.379
On your worst day, on my worst day, I'm going to heaven.

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:57.259
And I wonder this morning, do we have excitement?

00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:02.459
Are we living with that joy that heaven is my home?

00:44:03.419 --> 00:44:06.659
If you're not certain of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible.

00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:09.539
In fact, we'll have some folks down here this morning

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:11.499
that they'd take a Bible if you're a lady,

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:12.579
we'll have a lady talk with you.

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:14.059
If you're a man, we'll have a man talk with you

00:44:14.059 --> 00:44:15.939
and have a Bible available to show you

00:44:15.939 --> 00:44:19.139
what God says in his word about being saved.

00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:22.619
If you're not sure of heaven, today is the day of salvation.

00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:25.099
But for those of us that know Christ as our savior,

00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:26.899
live with joy, live with excitement,

00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:30.619
and have a burden to tell somebody else

00:44:30.619 --> 00:44:34.059
that they too can be saved by the grace of God.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:34.899
Let's pray together.

00:44:34.899 --> 00:44:37.619
Father, how we love you this morning.

00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:39.220
We thank you so much for loving us.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.859
We thank you for your word, for the truth of your word.

00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:45.299
We thank you for who you are.

00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:48.699
We thank you for the plan of salvation.

00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:51.419
We thank you for the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:44:51.419 --> 00:44:53.139
And Father, if there's one here this morning

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:54.899
that's not sure of heaven,

00:44:54.899 --> 00:44:56.339
oh, it's our prayer that today

00:44:56.339 --> 00:44:57.619
would be the day of their salvation,

00:44:57.619 --> 00:44:58.940
that we could take a Bible and show them

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.619
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:03.539
I pray for every Christian here this morning.

00:45:03.539 --> 00:45:06.299
God, would you stir us?

00:45:06.299 --> 00:45:08.779
God, would you help us to have a burden to reach others?

00:45:08.779 --> 00:45:13.739
Would you help us to live every day with excitement and joy?

00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:15.419
Because this expectation,

00:45:17.459 --> 00:45:20.699
that which we know to be absent from the body

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:23.379
is to be present with the Lord.

00:45:23.379 --> 00:45:26.059
We ask that you'd move and work as only you can,

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:27.299
and we'll thank you for it.

00:45:27.299 --> 00:45:28.379
In Christ's name we pray.

00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:29.619
Would you stand with me?

00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:30.859
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:45:30.859 --> 00:45:31.699
No one's looking around.

00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:33.659
We have an invitation at the end of each of our services

00:45:33.659 --> 00:45:35.539
for the purpose of allowing people

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:38.220
to respond to the message.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.659
Mark is down here this morning.

00:45:39.659 --> 00:45:40.859
Holly's down here this morning.

00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:42.099
If you're a lady, you don't know for sure

00:45:42.099 --> 00:45:43.259
that heaven's your home,

00:45:43.259 --> 00:45:44.220
we'd invite you to come.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.059
We'd never embarrass you,

00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:47.619
but Holly would meet with you and share with you

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:48.500
what the Bible says.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.899
Mark, if you're a man, he'll meet with you.

00:45:50.899 --> 00:45:52.659
Maybe you just want to come and pray.

00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:53.500
You don't want to thank God

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.899
for the salvation that he's given you.

00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:55.779
Maybe you want to come,

00:45:55.779 --> 00:45:57.819
there's a burden on your heart for someone

00:45:57.819 --> 00:45:58.940
that needs to be saved,

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.579
and you want to pray that God gives you that opportunity,

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:02.419
that you would live.

00:46:02.419 --> 00:46:03.859
Maybe you acknowledge in your life

00:46:03.859 --> 00:46:05.859
that you've been living under the circumstances

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:08.139
without that eternal perspective.

00:46:08.139 --> 00:46:10.819
The altar is open, as Kimberly plays.
