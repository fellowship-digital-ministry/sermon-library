1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
We looked at this verse last week.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,079
We're going to run over to the book of 1 Corinthians as soon as I read this verse.

3
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:08,159
And if you want to just start in 1 Corinthians, that's fine.

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:12,899
I'm just going to read Matthew 4 and verse 19 quickly and then get right into the message

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:13,899
this evening.

6
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:19,360
The Bible says this in Matthew 4 and 19, and He saith unto them, Follow Me, and I will

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,879
make you fishers of men.

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,200
I said this last week that our job is to follow Christ, and as we follow Him, He does a work

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
in us.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,380
He said, I will make you fishers of men.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,619
And no doubt as we yield ourselves to the Lord, as we allow Him to do a work in us,

12
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:43,740
we have to have a part in that, allowing Him to do the work.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,259
But He said to the disciples that I will make you fishers of men.

14
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:56,380
And what a joy to know, to experience the work that Christ does within His people.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,939
The Bible says that if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

16
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:59,939
Old things are passed away.

17
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,860
Behold, all things are become new.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,900
We understand that we're to be conformed to the image of His dear Son.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,919
We understand that we're to be like Christ, and He's doing a work in us.

20
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,980
We sing the song with the children often.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,220
He's still working on me, and to make me what I ought to be.

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,220
And I wonder this evening if we would allow God to have His way that we could say that

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,819
we're following Christ, and He's making us fishers of men.

24
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,180
First Corinthians chapter 1, we're going to look at chapter 1 and 2 before we get into

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,620
the message this evening with some points, just some applicable type of thoughts for

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
you tonight.

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,019
But we understand, after looking at the message from last Sunday evening, that we should share

28
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,019
the gospel.

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,459
It is important that we understand our responsibility, not only our responsibility, but the privilege

30
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:53,660
that God has given us to be His spokespeople, to be His representatives.

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,099
And what a joy that is.

32
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,879
Next week we're going to go through the particular verses that we will use as we're seeking to

33
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,800
share the gospel.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,339
Before we do that, however, I believe that it's important for us to understand how we

35
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,899
can get to the most important subject.

36
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,520
In other words, like, let me say it like this, often in life we can have conversations with

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,300
individuals and never actually talk about the Lord, yet alone address the subject of

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
the gospel.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,619
And we can have conversations with people, we can maybe have the intentions that I want

40
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:34,100
to be able to share the gospel with this individual and we begin talking and we talk about sports

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,500
and we talk about the weather and we talk about politics and we talk about whatever

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,380
we talk about and the conversation ends and we walk away and we say, I never even shared

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:52,240
the most important thing that I could possibly share with that individual, never even bringing

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
up the subject.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,080
As we look in the book of 1 Corinthians in chapter 1, I want you to see what Paul says,

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,720
and I'm going to read not the entirety of the chapter, but I'm going to read the last

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,960
portion of chapter 1 and into the beginning portion of chapter 2.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,460
And I'm going to pick it up in verse number 15, the Bible says, lest any man should say

49
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,419
that I had baptized in my own name and I baptized also the household of Stephanas, besides I

50
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,919
know not whether I baptized any other.

51
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,699
Notice verse 17, for Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with

52
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,460
wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,940
Now remember that statement at the end of verse number 17, it's important for us to

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:44,619
recognize this, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of

55
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:50,039
none effect, not with wisdom of words.

56
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,919
Verse number 18, for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, notice what

57
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:04,500
he says, foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,160
It's the same message, but to those of us that have been saved by the grace of God,

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,399
that we've been saved and we know that heaven is our home, the preaching of the gospel is

60
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,839
the power of God.

61
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,679
But to a lost person, it's foolishness.

62
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:25,140
And God does a work, and it's the work of the Holy Spirit, not only in the life of the

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,339
individual that's saved, that's sharing the gospel, but in the life of the individual

64
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,859
that's hearing the gospel.

65
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:39,700
You understand you cannot use wisdom, the words that are of wisdom, to try to get somebody

66
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
saved.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,899
No, the Holy Spirit of God has to do a work.

68
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:49,540
The Holy Spirit of God, His job, according to John 16, one of His ministries is to reprove

69
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,940
the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment to come.

70
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,619
And we read that in John 16.

71
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:02,859
And so we find that the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness.

72
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:08,500
I've heard people that have mocked the gospel, they've mocked it, it doesn't make sense to

73
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
them.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,820
They criticize it, and it's foolishness to them, but I want you to understand that it's

75
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,100
still the gospel that we're supposed to preach.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,299
He said in verse number 17, for Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach what?

77
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:22,820
To preach the gospel.

78
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
What is the gospel?

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,140
Well, the gospel, very simply, is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

80
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,100
It is the good news.

81
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,179
Verse 19, for it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing

82
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,820
the understanding of the prudent.

83
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Where is the wise?

84
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Where is the scribe?

85
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,459
Where is the disputer of this world?

86
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:42,980
Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

87
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,100
Do you remember what Romans 1 says, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

88
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,619
Verse 21, for after that, the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.

89
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:59,940
It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

90
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,940
Verse 22, for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach

91
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,420
Christ crucified.

92
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,059
To the Jews, a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks, foolishness.

93
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:15,820
But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and

94
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,459
the wisdom of God, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness

95
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,179
of God is stronger than men.

96
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:24,359
Isn't that encouraging?

97
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,739
Verse number 25, praise the Lord.

98
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:32,260
Verse 26, for ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh,

99
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,179
not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of

100
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:42,079
the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound

101
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,739
the things which are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised

102
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:52,540
hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not to bring to naught things that are.

103
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Why?

104
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,459
Why did God choose to work this way?

105
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:03,019
Why is it that God has revealed to Paul and now to the church in Corinth the way in which

106
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,459
he, God, is going to work?

107
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:15,420
Notice verse 29, that no flesh should glory in his presence, that no flesh should glory

108
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
in his presence.

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,660
It's all about Christ.

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,779
And we find that it says, verse 30, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God has

111
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:28,500
made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, that according

112
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,859
as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

113
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:39,019
It's a work that God does, not a work that you do, it's not a work that I do, it's a

114
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:44,540
work that God does, but God uses his people.

115
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,559
And when we're humble and we're understanding of how God works, it's amazing how God would

116
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:57,059
use us when we yield ourselves, when we follow him and we're walking in humility, we are

117
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:03,859
clothed with humility, as Peter says in 1 Peter 5, that we are able to see God do a

118
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:13,059
work in and through us and use us as instruments in his hand to reach others with the gospel.

119
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:18,339
Chapter two, notice in verse number one, and I, brethren, when I came unto you, came to

120
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:23,660
you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony

121
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,100
of God, for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,979
And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, and my speech and my

123
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:42,280
preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit

124
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,859
and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of

125
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,820
God.

126
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,500
Does this mean when we read the end of chapter one, the beginning of chapter number two,

127
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,219
does it mean that we should not be prepared, does it mean that we shouldn't go through

128
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,219
any preparation?

129
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,140
No, it doesn't mean that.

130
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,820
It simply means we must be more dependent on the Lord and the Holy Spirit than we are

131
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,219
on our preparation.

132
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:12,260
We understand that Ezra, the Bible describes him as being a ready scribe.

133
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,979
The Bible says in Ezra 7 and verse number 10 that he prepared his heart to seek and

134
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:24,419
to do and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments, and so he sought the Lord.

135
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,179
He was a ready scribe.

136
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,580
And you know it's interesting because what happened in the life of Ezra, if you were

137
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,739
to read beyond chapter seven and verse number 10 and you continue to read through the passage

138
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:39,419
of Scripture in the seventh chapter, you know what you find is that Ezra then had opportunity

139
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,659
to teach because he was a prepared, he was a ready scribe.

140
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:50,659
But we must recognize this evening that we're not going to see souls saved and lives changed

141
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:57,780
because simply or completely in our preparation, we must be dependent on the Holy Spirit of

142
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,299
God.

143
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:04,299
Seek to go with the words of wisdom, as he says in verse number four of chapter number

144
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:10,739
two, my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration

145
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,059
of the spirit and of power.

146
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,059
Why?

147
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:18,939
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

148
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:26,099
Far too often, Christians have tried to win arguments instead of simply sharing the gospel.

149
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:34,159
And it's a grave danger that we make in trying to win arguments or argue somebody into heaven.

150
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,459
You can't argue anyone into heaven.

151
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,619
You know, there are times in which you could see and no doubt there's many of them that

152
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:44,899
are available that you could look at videos and what have you, where you can find a lost

153
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,419
person that is left in a position of not being able to give an answer.

154
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:54,719
In other words, if you were to rule from a perspective of who won the debate or who won

155
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:59,999
the argument, you would say, and side with the Christian.

156
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,759
But the lost person still didn't get saved.

157
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,659
So what's the goal?

158
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,919
Is the goal to win the debate, win the argument?

159
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,719
Or is the goal to see souls saved and lives changed?

160
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:15,839
And so we must understand, again, it's not saying that we should have no preparation,

161
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,679
it's just what is our approach when we're seeking to share the gospel with an individual?

162
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:27,199
Do we want that individual to look at us and say, wow, look at how much they know?

163
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:31,759
Can I tell you, if that's your goal, you're very unlikely to see anyone trust Christ as

164
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,099
their savior.

165
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:37,319
Because what's on display is you want people to see how well versed you are and how much

166
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,959
you know and how many answers you can give.

167
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,079
Look over, if you will, we looked at verses chapters one and two, turn over to chapter

168
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,159
number nine, if you will.

169
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,279
And I'm going to give you some more from here, and then I have a list of seven things,

170
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,839
and I'm just going to touch through them quickly, not going to spend a ton of time on them,

171
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,739
but really how it is that we can approach the subject of sharing the gospel and being

172
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:04,879
able to accomplish what we're seeking to accomplish.

173
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,759
In 1 Corinthians chapter number nine, in verse number 16, the Bible says, for though I preach

174
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,159
the gospel, I have nothing to glory of.

175
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,639
Isn't that a great perspective?

176
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,599
You know, the apostle Paul was used of God to see a number of churches planted, to see

177
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,719
a number of people come to Christ.

178
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:27,119
But he says, for though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for necessity

179
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:32,399
is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.

180
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,599
For if I do this thing willingly, verse 17, I have a reward, but if against my will a

181
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:40,559
dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me, what is my reward then?

182
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,599
Verily, that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge,

183
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,319
that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

184
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,959
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might

185
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,959
gain them more.

186
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,079
Now, Paul's going to say some things in the next few verses that are important for us

187
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,479
to understand how he's approaching this.

188
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,359
In verse 20, it says, unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews.

189
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,159
To them that are under the law is under the law, that I might gain them that are under

190
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,159
the law.

191
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,279
To them that are without law is without law.

192
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:30,719
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.

193
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:36,119
Now, we have to understand that as we look at verses 20, really 19 down through 22, and

194
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:40,599
look at what Paul says, and he summarizes it in the end of verse number 22, that I am

195
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:44,559
made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

196
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,999
This is not a verse, this is not a proof text that you go to, to prove compromise, to prove

197
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:55,199
ecumenical movement, and so on and so forth.

198
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,319
Paul is not saying that I'm going to abandon the truth of God's word so that I might be

199
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,079
able to try to reach somebody with the gospel, no.

200
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:10,879
He's saying that I don't want to be the stumbling block, I don't want to be in the way of anyone

201
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,879
being saved.

202
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,479
Does that make sense?

203
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:18,479
And so I'm going to become all things to all men, I'm going to try to seek to reach as

204
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:24,500
many people as I possibly can with the gospel, I don't want to get in the way, I don't want

205
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,720
to be the hindrance to an individual being saved, I'm going to go and preach the gospel.

206
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,879
And he says, and this I do for the gospel's sake, I said this last week, it's worth repeating

207
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,720
as we look at this portion of scripture, if you're saved by the grace of God this evening,

208
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,079
you're going to heaven, amen?

209
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,079
You believe that tonight?

210
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,039
If you're saved, you're going to heaven.

211
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,799
If you never lead somebody to Christ, or if the person you're working with doesn't trust

212
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,119
Christ, you're still going to heaven.

213
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:03,199
But the reality is that we want others to go to heaven with us.

214
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,359
We understand, listen, the alternative is the lake of fire.

215
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,279
It's not a good alternative.

216
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,739
Somebody said this, they said it this way, you must really hate people to not be willing

217
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,720
to tell them the truth of the gospel.

218
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,839
And that was just a very raw way in which the individual said it, but it really was

219
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,000
so impactful the way that they said it, because the reality is that if we know the truth of

220
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:36,799
the gospel, if we fail to share the gospel, and we're not taking advantage of the opportunity

221
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:45,720
that God gives us as he's put us into our path, crosses with that individual, then we

222
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
have this responsibility.

223
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,639
And if we don't give them the gospel, what is it that we don't understand?

224
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,919
What is it that we're fearful of?

225
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,319
Most times we're afraid of rejection, we're afraid that someone's going to get upset with

226
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,639
us.

227
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
I mentioned last week, there are times in which we shy away and we're fearful because

228
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,039
we may not know the answer.

229
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,979
Well, remember the verses that we looked at tonight in chapter one and two of 1 Corinthians,

230
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:12,399
you do not need to know every answer.

231
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,019
You are not going to know every answer.

232
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:20,639
And if you wait until you think you know every answer to try to share the gospel with someone,

233
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,359
you will be surprised that someone will ask you a question that you didn't prepare to

234
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,279
answer.

235
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,799
That's the way it works.

236
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,679
People come up with some really hypothetical, crazy, off the wall things.

237
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,519
They'll start talking to you about aliens, they'll start talking to you, I mean, they'll

238
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,720
just talk to you about all kinds, I'm telling you the truth.

239
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,599
Tim and I stood at a door three months ago and this, I can't even tell you what the guy

240
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,599
was talking about.

241
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:46,119
He was all over the board, man.

242
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:52,079
He was just, he was out there and he was just trying to get us distracted from being able

243
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,899
to share the truth of the gospel.

244
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,220
Remember the God of this world, little G, God of this world, he hath blinded the minds

245
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,859
of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto

246
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,859
them.

247
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,339
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

248
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,699
And so if I desire, if I understand this evening that I should share the gospel and I say,

249
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,019
I want to be able to get to the subject.

250
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,139
I've been in so many cases, I've been in so many situations where I've just never been

251
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,699
able to actually get to the subject that I want to get to.

252
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
What are some practical ways?

253
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,059
What are some things that we can do to try to get to the gospel?

254
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,059
Let me say this.

255
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,339
Some of what I'm going to share with you tonight is really the context of, especially the first

256
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,699
point dealing with a door to door kind of a situation where you're knocking doors.

257
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:45,339
You understand when you go and knock a door, if you've never done it before, and I'll tell

258
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:49,339
you this just from practice, every time I do it, brother Mark, the first one is the

259
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,779
hardest one.

260
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,459
I don't know how you feel about it, but that first one, there's this kind of like emotion

261
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:58,379
that builds up in you of like, oh, what's going to happen?

262
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,019
What are they going to say?

263
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,220
And you say, but you're the pastor.

264
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm a person.

265
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm a human being.

266
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
Amen.

267
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,859
And that first door is always the hardest door.

268
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:12,139
And so this first thought, number one, if you're taking notes, how is it that we're

269
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,019
going to approach people with the gospel?

270
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,500
I try to encourage people, especially with door to door, is to be observant and find

271
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,479
some common ground.

272
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,579
You're knocking on a stranger's door.

273
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,940
They don't know who you are.

274
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,379
You don't know who they are.

275
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,139
They don't know you from anyone.

276
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:31,339
And here you are standing at their door, knocking at their door.

277
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:34,859
Now today, things are quite complicated.

278
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:40,679
I've shared this with some folks, and I feel like we need to try to be as creative as possible

279
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,739
and still within the bounds of scripture, but you know, it's very complicated today.

280
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:50,219
I would say probably 85% of the doors that we have knocked on in the last few months

281
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:56,059
have these fancy ring doorbells or some type of doorbell that's a smart doorbell.

282
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,380
They can see you and you can't see them, and they just don't come to the door.

283
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,299
They just have no interaction with you, or they'll come over the little thing and say,

284
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,380
can I help you?

285
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,019
And you say who you are, and they're like, just leave it at the door, right?

286
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,739
They're not interested in having conversation.

287
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:14,820
So if you can have conversation, if someone comes to the door and you're able to have

288
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,380
that conversation, I try to encourage people to be observant as they're even approaching

289
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,059
the door and find some common ground.

290
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,659
Ronnie and I were knocking doors a couple of weeks ago, and I noticed that on the porch

291
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:30,619
of the home that we were approaching, there was a flag that I did not recognize.

292
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:35,380
Now there were three flags on that particular home, and as the person came, I said, hey,

293
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
listen.

294
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,179
I said, I don't recognize that one flag.

295
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,200
I know the American flag, but what's that other flag?

296
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
And they got all excited.

297
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Why?

298
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Because it was the flag of their homeland.

299
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,219
It was the flag of their country, and they began to tell me about their flag and where

300
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,219
they were from.

301
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:55,459
I just was simply trying to find a common ground to try to bring the wall down a little

302
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,700
bit, if you understand what I mean.

303
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,339
If you've never knocked doors, you might not be able to understand what I mean.

304
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,179
to understand how that works,

305
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,259
but you're talking to a complete stranger.

306
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,939
They don't know, they think you have an agenda.

307
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:04,979
Why are you here?

308
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,299
What are you trying to get?

309
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,699
I mean, it can be really a difficulty,

310
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,939
and so I try to find some common ground.

311
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,339
Many times, if I find that there's a flag

312
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:16,259
that is a branch of the service,

313
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,939
I'll make a comment about, hey, did you serve in the,

314
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,459
fill in the blank, the Army, the Air Force,

315
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,499
whatever it is, thank you for your service.

316
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,979
And then very quickly, I mean,

317
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:26,099
that's just a quick kind of statement,

318
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,939
try to find some common ground.

319
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:30,099
We had some visitors that came for Easter

320
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:32,579
that we, Joseph and I, knocked their door

321
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,579
the day before Easter, and they came on Easter Sunday,

322
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,059
Resurrection Sunday, and we went to their door.

323
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,939
They had a little rock on their front porch that said,

324
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,499
you've entered Eagles territory,

325
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:46,339
and the Philadelphia Eagles, the emblem was there.

326
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,259
And so what did I do?

327
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:50,179
I said, hey, listen, I said, are you guys Eagles fans?

328
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,419
You're down here in Virginia, and you're fans of the Eagles?

329
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,619
And Carter's like, yeah, it doesn't matter

330
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,699
where you live, you can be an Eagles fan, amen?

331
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,819
And he's their big Eagles fan.

332
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,139
And I just tried to get a little common ground.

333
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:04,139
I don't wanna spend a ton of time there,

334
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,899
I don't wanna have a long discussion,

335
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,059
but I wanna find a little common ground

336
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,419
so that I can have some further conversation.

337
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,779
So then, very quickly, after I find a little common ground,

338
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,819
I would say number two, clearly introduce yourself.

339
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,499
Let the people know who you are, where you're from.

340
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,419
Don't shy away from the fact that you're

341
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,979
with Fellowship Baptist Church, that you're with the church.

342
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,039
They need to know who you are, why you're there.

343
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,699
You begin to kind of have that introduction personally,

344
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,459
and no one else would have this situation.

345
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,939
But me, I never introduce myself as the pastor, never.

346
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:43,139
I always introduce myself as Chris.

347
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:48,299
I don't, I never introduce myself as the pastor.

348
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,119
We were knocking doors down in Fairfax,

349
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,939
and after about six or seven minutes of talking to this guy,

350
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,539
he said, oh, you're the pastor?

351
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,499
And he ran over and turned his music down

352
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,219
and then shook my hand and was all,

353
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:02,699
and he was all, the whole, changed his whole demeanor.

354
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:03,999
And so I try to just be careful.

355
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,539
I just want, look, I'm just a person.

356
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,859
And I just introduce myself, I introduce whoever's with me.

357
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:13,779
And these are the first couple of points here, again,

358
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,439
with regard to if you're out and you're trying

359
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:19,219
to share the gospel with people that you don't know.

360
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,339
All right, if you're having some common ground,

361
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,939
it's a neighbor, it's a coworker,

362
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:26,739
obviously these points are not points

363
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,399
that would be applicable with regard

364
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,379
to that particular situation.

365
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,859
But now getting back to how it is

366
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,819
that we get to the subject of the gospel,

367
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,499
I believe it's important that we, number three,

368
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:41,459
ask questions, begin to ask some questions.

369
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,579
Oftentimes, I will begin asking someone

370
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,819
about their church background.

371
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,459
Many times today, people will say, I don't go to church,

372
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,859
I don't have any church affiliation,

373
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,279
and I'll maybe ask them something like this,

374
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,879
well, did you ever go to church?

375
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:56,979
Well, yeah, I went to church when I was a kid.

376
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:59,259
Oh, that's great, what church did you go to?

377
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,899
I'm asking questions, I'm showing, number four,

378
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:06,979
genuine interest, but I'm trying to get some information

379
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:09,739
so that I know how to give the conversation

380
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:12,539
or how to guide the conversation.

381
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,419
Can I say this, when you're asking those questions

382
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,059
and it goes hand in hand with showing genuine interest,

383
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,019
make sure that you're listening to the answers.

384
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,779
Get their name, use their name.

385
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,159
And when you get the answers to the question,

386
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,739
make sure that you let them know

387
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,659
that you're tracking with them

388
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,499
and you're having this interaction with them.

389
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:37,019
The reality this evening is that as we're asking

390
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,099
those questions and showing that interest,

391
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:43,699
we're gaining some level of being able to insert the gospel

392
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:47,859
and take the conversation to where we want it to go.

393
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,419
And so the thought that I have, number five,

394
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,699
again, if you're taking notes, stay on topic

395
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,259
and lead the conversation of the gospel.

396
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,539
Lead the conversation of the gospel.

397
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,019
Now, how does this work?

398
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,459
How is it that we have these interactions?

399
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:04,099
Many times I've been in situations

400
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:07,099
where I'm never able to actually get to the gospel.

401
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,979
The conversation, the person's not interested,

402
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,759
they don't give you but like four seconds,

403
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,139
they just don't wanna have it.

404
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,799
And so how do I get the topic?

405
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,059
How do I lead the conversation to the gospel

406
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,499
if I'm seeking to share the most important message

407
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,819
that I could ever share?

408
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,419
I'm going to take those opportunities

409
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:28,339
when it comes to asking about church,

410
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,179
if they say anything about church attendance.

411
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,899
Many times I've said something like this,

412
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,299
well, listen, it's important to go to church,

413
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,459
it's commendable to go to church,

414
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:38,099
but most importantly is knowing for sure

415
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,659
if you were to die that you'd go to heaven.

416
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,339
And you say, man, you just bring up the subject of death.

417
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,339
Listen, I'm there to share the gospel.

418
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,659
And the reality is this, every person

419
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,019
that we come in contact with is going to die.

420
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:57,419
Now, let me say this, it's not a comfortable subject.

421
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,579
You know, a lot of people, according to the scriptures,

422
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:05,459
Hebrews 2, they have a fear of death, right?

423
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,179
And so they don't like talking about

424
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,419
what they're afraid of, does that make sense?

425
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,699
But Ecclesiastes says this,

426
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,659
that it's better to go to the house of mourning

427
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,139
than to the house of feasting.

428
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:16,979
Why?

429
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:19,099
It's the end of all men.

430
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:21,859
Listen, every one of us,

431
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:25,379
unless Jesus comes back while we're still alive,

432
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,979
they're gonna have a funeral service

433
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,059
and it's gonna be ours.

434
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,699
We're gonna die.

435
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,379
Can I tell you that during COVID,

436
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:35,739
it was actually really easy to talk about this.

437
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:37,659
It really was, I'm not kidding.

438
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,499
It was amazing.

439
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:42,019
I had people approaching me during COVID.

440
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,259
Hey, you gave me one of them gospel tracks before,

441
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,219
like, what's gonna happen?

442
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,539
You try to, what an opportunity.

443
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:52,459
Because so many people were concerned

444
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:53,659
about dying from COVID.

445
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,499
And I would say to people repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly,

446
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:58,979
there are more people dying from all kinds of other things

447
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:00,419
than there are dying from COVID.

448
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,819
And the reality is that you have, listen,

449
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,019
I said this to our local representative

450
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,539
that sits on the board here in our Providence district.

451
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,499
I said, listen, the chances of you or me dying from COVID

452
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:16,379
are pretty low given all of the information that we have,

453
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,259
but there is a 100% chance we're gonna die.

454
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:21,859
We're gonna die.

455
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,539
And so I try to get to that subject.

456
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:29,539
I don't wanna be really unkind about it,

457
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:33,859
but the reality is that if we're going to share the gospel,

458
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,059
we have to get to the point of sharing the gospel.

459
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,139
We have to be purposed.

460
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,379
I'm not just trying to stand and shoot the breeze,

461
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,419
with some person that I don't know

462
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,299
and just talking about some team

463
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:47,779
or some activity or something.

464
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,139
No, I've come, Christ Jesus according,

465
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,659
remember what Paul said there in 1 Corinthians 1.17,

466
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,619
for Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.

467
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,339
He said, but we preach Christ crucified.

468
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:02,859
And so we have this responsibility to go

469
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,739
and to preach the gospel,

470
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,979
to give the truth of Christ's death,

471
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,139
his burial and his resurrection.

472
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,099
And so we wanna lead the conversation to the gospel.

473
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,539
Sometimes I'll be able to ask somebody with that question,

474
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,339
hey, are you 100% sure if you were to die today,

475
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,979
you'd go to heaven?

476
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:24,259
You know, many times people say, nah, I mean, not 100%,

477
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,859
but like maybe 80%, 90%.

478
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,299
And that always makes me kind of chuckle internally.

479
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,259
I never chuckle externally,

480
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:33,019
but I kind of wonder in my own mind,

481
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,859
what is it that makes you think 70%, 80%, 90?

482
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,459
Like, how do you figure that, right?

483
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:41,019
Like what is the equation that you're using

484
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:42,859
to reach your conclusion?

485
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:45,459
I don't ask that question in that manner,

486
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:48,139
but many times I'll say this, well, how do you know?

487
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,059
How do you know?

488
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:51,899
What am I doing?

489
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,099
I'm getting them to give me an answer.

490
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,899
Because when they give me an answer,

491
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:59,639
it enables me to be able to know where to go scripturally.

492
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:02,739
What verses am I gonna give them?

493
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,139
Where am I gonna begin?

494
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:07,499
As I begin to, and we'll look at verses next week,

495
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,339
I'm being able to share those verses.

496
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,099
And all of this, I know that I'm spending a lot of time

497
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,779
going through this, but the reality is this is just,

498
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,059
I mean, just a very quick time.

499
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,639
You have a moment of opportunity

500
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:23,219
to be able to get to this point.

501
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:26,419
And so then I have number six, if you're taking notes,

502
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,459
I think I've shared all of them up to this point,

503
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:29,739
but I dealt with it last week.

504
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:32,139
Number six would be this, share your story.

505
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:34,739
I said this last week, make it personal.

506
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:35,819
What did Christ do for you?

507
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:38,179
How did Christ change your life?

508
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,939
If you are tracking with me this evening,

509
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:43,339
I've not yet said one thing

510
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:45,499
about inviting somebody to our church.

511
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,579
Do we want people to come to our church?

512
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:52,659
Sure, absolutely.

513
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,139
I'm thankful for every visitor

514
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,419
that comes through these doors, I am.

515
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,099
We follow up with them.

516
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:01,059
We have meals with them, our family does.

517
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,379
We try to reach them, try to follow up at their homes.

518
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:08,039
I mean, we do all sorts of things to try to reach people.

519
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:10,079
But the reality is that we're not just simply

520
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,239
trying to get people to come to a church.

521
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:16,239
We wanna share the gospel with people.

522
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,239
And we wanna be able to get to the gospel.

523
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:21,479
I said this last week, but it's worth repeating.

524
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:26,479
As soon as you make the emphasis on visiting church,

525
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,999
that individual that you're speaking to

526
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:33,999
already has a predetermined idea about church.

527
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,959
They already have something in their mind

528
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,199
that they believe about church.

529
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,019
Whether it's positive or negative,

530
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,959
whether it's an experience that they've had as a child,

531
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:47,559
whether it's an experience of a family member,

532
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,959
whatever it might be.

533
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:52,079
My grandfather, when my dad was going

534
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,919
to South Carolina, Parris Island,

535
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,959
to go to boot camp, and then afterwards

536
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,559
he was stationed in North Carolina because of COVID.

537
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:03,359
Every Marine goes down there after they get to Paris Island

538
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,799
and he's there and they were talking about churches.

539
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,719
And my grandfather, who I do not think at that point

540
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:12,719
in his life ever, ever stepped foot in a Baptist church,

541
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,279
said to my dad, beware of the Baptists

542
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,599
because they handle snakes.

543
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,319
I'm telling you the truth, man.

544
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,719
Now you know me, I wouldn't be a Baptist

545
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,479
if we handled snakes, amen?

546
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:28,599
And I hate snakes, I am not handling snakes.

547
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,119
I have zero idea where my grandfather got that idea.

548
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,119
Now I know there's some boys over in West Virginia

549
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,079
that handle snakes and some of those boys

550
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,319
got bit by rattlesnakes.

551
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,159
I don't understand what's wrong with them,

552
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,039
but that's what they do.

553
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,459
They don't understand Mark 16 and that's fine.

554
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,599
The reality is that my dad was told that.

555
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,799
Now let me fast forward.

556
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,799
That was like in 1977, 1978 that my dad was told that.

557
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,639
My dad was told that.

558
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:01,639
It was in 1992, so you do the math, right?

559
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,159
14 years, go by, and in 1992 my dad hears somebody

560
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,719
that says there are a lot of dead people

561
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,559
in the world that are waiting to die.

562
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,519
My dad doesn't understand what that means.

563
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,119
He inquires and he says, the man says,

564
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,719
well, there are a lot of people that are dead spiritually

565
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,839
that are just waiting to die a physical death.

566
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,359
And at that moment, my dad was under conviction.

567
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,059
We're going to church.

568
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,359
My mom says you go to your church, I go to my church.

569
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,079
I'm sitting there as almost 13 years old

570
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,599
and I'm like wait, hold on.

571
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,519
You don't have a church and you don't have a church.

572
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,359
What are you talking about?

573
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,959
You go to your church and I'm going to my church.

574
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,679
We didn't go to church.

575
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,519
I'm telling you the truth.

576
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,419
We never went.

577
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,419
We didn't even go to church on Easter and Christmas.

578
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,059
We just didn't go to church.

579
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,139
So what do they do?

580
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,879
Well, my dad went to the Methodist church

581
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,139
and my mom went to the Catholic church.

582
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:51,199
One time.

583
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:53,119
My dad went to the Methodist church, I think twice.

584
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,199
My mom went to the Catholic church.

585
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,679
I remember going to the Methodist church

586
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:59,319
and to the Catholic church and I remember it being empty.

587
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,819
There was just no gospel given.

588
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,919
There was no truth given.

589
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,519
It was very strange and I remember my dad

590
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:09,399
going back to that worker, that young Marine

591
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,099
and saying where do you go to church?

592
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,479
You know what he said?

593
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:16,659
Grace Baptist Church.

594
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:18,919
Do you know one of the first thoughts

595
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,279
that went through my dad's mind when he heard that?

596
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,499
What his dad told him 14 years earlier.

597
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,679
So you know what my dad did?

598
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,619
He went on a Wednesday night by himself.

599
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,839
He didn't take my mom and he didn't take me or my brother.

600
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,839
He went by himself to see what the situation was.

601
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,519
You know the preacher that night?

602
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,839
Rodney Padat was his name.

603
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,999
He preached a message on hell on a Wednesday night.

604
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,339
My dad sat in the back row and he would say

605
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,219
if he was here that he was under so much conviction

606
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,659
that his knuckles were white by holding on

607
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,799
so tightly to the pew.

608
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,099
He went back the next Sunday and he got saved.

609
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:05,979
Everybody has an idea when they hear church.

610
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:09,339
I'm thankful that my dad didn't avoid going

611
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:11,639
to a Baptist church because of what he was told

612
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,299
but there was no grounds for what he was told.

613
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,299
It was just some kind of hearsay.

614
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,619
People have an idea about church.

615
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:23,179
I'm not there to just simply say come to our church.

616
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,699
I'm there to preach Christ.

617
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:26,659
Can I share my story?

618
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,499
Can I tell you what Christ did for me?

619
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:30,419
Can I tell you how he changed my life?

620
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,499
There was a day in my life where I had no hope.

621
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:34,459
I had no peace.

622
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,459
I had no joy.

623
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:37,539
I was going down a road to nowhere.

624
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:39,059
In fact, I was going somewhere.

625
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,339
I was heading for a Christless eternity.

626
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,259
There's a song, then Jesus stepped in.

627
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,299
Oh, hallelujah, that he saved me.

628
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,859
He changed my life.

629
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:54,579
We get to start there and sharing your story

630
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,819
with that individual.

631
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,779
Let me say this as we wrap up this evening.

632
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,179
So we wanna get to sharing the gospel.

633
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,539
I'm gonna go through next week all the verses

634
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,379
and then we're gonna actually have an opportunity

635
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,619
to say it's gonna be very different.

636
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,679
It is gonna be a different Sunday night service.

637
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,319
After I go through the message next week,

638
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,479
it's gonna be a shorter message.

639
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:14,099
You're gonna get to put to practice some of what we learned.

640
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,219
We're gonna do it right here in church.

641
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,139
We're just gonna find somebody

642
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,779
and just go ahead and share a story

643
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:20,819
and go through it and be able to give a presentation.

644
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,219
We'll turn off live stream early and be able to do that.

645
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,039
Why?

646
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,559
Because we wanna put into practice

647
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,119
what we're trying to learn.

648
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,079
So we will get into all the verses.

649
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,559
Many times people refer to it as the Roman's road.

650
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,499
You've heard that terminology

651
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,479
and memorizing the Roman's road.

652
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,959
And certainly those are good verses.

653
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,939
I oftentimes start in John 10 personally

654
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,799
because the good shepherd, he gave his life for the sheep

655
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:49,319
and that we, according to verse number 10,

656
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,759
might have life more abundantly.

657
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:53,519
And I like to start there,

658
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,679
but we'll look at all those verses next week.

659
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,599
But let me say this to finish up tonight.

660
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,839
This is probably one of the most important things

661
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,779
I could say as we look at this subject matter

662
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,079
with regard to trying to share the gospel.

663
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,559
Number seven, if you're taking notes,

664
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,459
leave the door open for another opportunity.

665
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,039
Leave the door open for another opportunity.

666
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,379
The biblical principle, turn to 1 Corinthians, if you will,

667
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,919
and the third chapter.

668
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:28,859
So many times, if we're not careful,

669
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:36,259
we can go so far

670
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,599
that we turn that individual off

671
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,319
from any further conversation,

672
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:45,619
not only with us, but possibly with anyone else.

673
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,239
I suggest this evening

674
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,559
that as we look at 1 Corinthians chapter three,

675
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,479
that Paul understood a principle

676
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,479
that is important for us to understand.

677
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,959
They were saying in Corinth,

678
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,839
according to 1 Corinthians three and verse four,

679
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,159
I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos,

680
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,679
are you not carnal?

681
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,419
Who then is Paul and who is Apollos,

682
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:08,739
but ministers by whom you believed,

683
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,779
even as the Lord gave to every man.

684
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:15,899
We're just ministers, just ministers, servants.

685
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:20,419
Verse six, I have planted, Apollos watered,

686
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:23,499
but God gave the increase.

687
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:27,699
So then, verse seven, neither is he that planteth anything,

688
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:31,259
neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.

689
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:34,639
Now, he that planteth and he that watereth are one,

690
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,599
and every man shall receive his own reward

691
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,399
according to his own labor.

692
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,519
Notice this, verse nine,

693
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,599
for we are laborers together with God.

694
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,659
You're God's husbandry, you're God's building.

695
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,039
Remember, Jesus said, follow me

696
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,879
and I'll make you fishers of men.

697
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:51,299
We are laborers together with God.

698
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,159
But the principle here in 1 Corinthians three

699
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,479
that I think is so important

700
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,159
as we conclude this thought tonight

701
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,999
is that some plant, some water,

702
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,179
but God gives the increase.

703
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,059
God may use you on that first interaction

704
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,459
to simply plant the seed of the gospel.

705
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:12,659
And when you leave the door open,

706
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:14,499
it gives opportunity, number one,

707
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:18,339
for the Holy Spirit of God to work in that individual's life

708
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:22,059
and then for someone else to come along and water

709
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,739
and God gives the increase.

710
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:28,699
I do not want to, listen, the gospel is offensive,

711
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,539
but I don't need to be offensive.

712
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:35,259
The gospel's offensive, but I don't want to be offensive.

713
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:36,739
And I want to leave that door open.

714
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:40,419
I have given open invitations.

715
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:42,099
If you've ever gone door knocking with me,

716
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,339
you could stand here and say it.

717
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:44,499
You've heard me say it.

718
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:47,979
I have given countless invitations

719
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,519
to individuals to give me a call and let's have coffee.

720
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:53,779
Over and over and over.

721
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:55,019
I'm trying to leave the door open.

722
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,219
I'm trying to, hey, can I come back and follow up?

723
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,739
And I might stop back by,

724
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,099
especially if it's a good contact.

725
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,079
I want to give the opportunity,

726
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,559
give the Holy Spirit opportunity to work

727
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,879
and to understand I don't want to be the reason.

728
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,039
I don't want to be the hindrance,

729
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,399
not only for me not having another opportunity,

730
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:15,079
but somebody else having an opportunity

731
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,399
and going and sharing the gospel with that individual.

732
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:21,719
I don't know about you, but I know I can say for myself,

733
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,219
I did not get saved the first time I heard the gospel.

734
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,059
I didn't.

735
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,319
Maybe you're here tonight

736
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,379
and the very first time you ever heard the gospel,

737
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:33,059
you got saved and that's wonderful.

738
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:34,379
But I think for many of us,

739
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,979
we'd say we would testify that it wasn't the first time

740
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,979
that I heard the gospel that I got saved.

741
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:41,379
So what does that mean?

742
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,059
Well, it means that there were second and third

743
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,099
and fourth opportunities that someone came

744
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,259
and God was working and the water was being applied

745
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,499
and praise God.

746
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,539
And I want to give that open door of opportunity.

747
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,899
Let me say this.

748
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,779
Even when somebody doesn't give you a chance

749
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:59,639
to get anywhere near what we dealt with tonight,

750
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,859
I do two things.

751
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:05,399
I always try to leave them with either a gospel tract

752
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,119
or one of our brochures that has the gospel.

753
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,399
And I always do something like this.

754
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,559
I say, listen, I completely understand you're busy

755
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,439
or whatever.

756
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,399
Would you do me a favor?

757
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:16,919
Would you just make a commitment to read this?

758
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,839
There's some Bible verses in here

759
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,959
and I just want to know if you would read them.

760
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:25,399
Then I try to quote a verse of scripture.

761
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,779
The verse of scripture will vary

762
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,539
based upon the particular conversation

763
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,419
that I had with the individual.

764
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:32,939
But I like to quote a verse of scripture, why?

765
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:34,419
Because God uses his word.

766
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,019
Because God uses his word.

767
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:40,419
And so I want to use, I want to take an opportunity,

768
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,059
even if somebody says, no, I'm not interested.

769
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:44,539
If they say, no, I don't want that.

770
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:46,779
If I'm gonna offer them a tract or an invitation,

771
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,339
I still oftentimes will quote a verse of scripture

772
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,899
so that there's some piece of God's word

773
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:58,519
that is given that the Holy Spirit can use.

774
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,319
You know that God's word is powerful.

775
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:07,079
powerful. And with just one verse of Scripture, I believe it with all my heart tonight. I

776
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,759
believe that somebody that I talk to, somebody that you talk to, but we leave one verse of

777
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:17,159
Scripture with, I believe that that single verse of Scripture can keep them up at night.

778
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,319
And really wondering, what's going to happen when I die? The Holy Spirit's using His Word

779
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,319
in the heart of that individual, bringing conviction. That's what He does. And that's

780
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,559
a work that we can't do, but God has given us the tools to be able to do that, and He

781
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:40,939
does a work as we use His Word. It's not in the wisdom of man's words. It's in the power

782
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:47,839
of God's Word. I'm not going to a door trying to win an argument. I'm not trying to argue

783
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,719
somebody into heaven. No, I simply want to share the gospel. You know, there have been

784
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,079
some times that I've had to say, the example that I used when Tim and I, I don't know what

785
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,399
that guy was talking about. Eventually, after a few minutes, I just said, hey, listen, I

786
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:03,519
appreciate your time. You have a wonderful day. If you'd read those things, I'd love

787
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,879
to be able to get in touch with you again. I'm not going to sit there and try to argue

788
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:11,399
with the guy on his doorstep for how long am I going to argue with him. He's not going

789
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:15,159
to change my mind. I'm obviously not going to change his mind. And so, I just need to

790
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,159
go and move on. Does that make sense? But I want to try to leave the door open. I never

791
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,079
would insult somebody. I would never attack them and what they believe. No, I want to

792
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,959
leave a door open this evening. If we're going to share the gospel, we say, I understand

793
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:35,959
that I want to, the responsibility, the need to share the gospel. I got to have some kind

794
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:44,079
of a plan. How do I get there? Because there's far too often that we can have discussions,

795
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:51,079
conversations, intending to share the gospel, but never actually getting to it. And we leave

796
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,199
the meeting, we say, no, it was a good meeting, it was nice, it was a friendly conversation,

797
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:04,639
but we actually never got to the gospel. I went to lunch with our neighbor, and he is

798
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:13,399
a different world religion, and I went desiring to share the gospel with him. Can I tell you,

799
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:19,999
it was challenging for like the first 15 minutes. How am I going to, like, there's no crack

800
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:26,359
opening. We're just eating lunch and talking, and he was just talking about any subject

801
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:34,039
he could think of to really try to keep the conversation busy and avoiding what he probably

802
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:40,759
knew I wanted to talk to him about. He knew I was the pastor of the church. He's our neighbor.

803
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:44,119
And after about 15 minutes or so, I was able to, there was a statement that was made that

804
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:50,039
was able to get into the gospel. You know, that man, he didn't trust Christ that day,

805
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:58,039
but can I tell you for sure, he knows the truth of what God's Word says. And that's

806
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:04,159
our duty. Our duty is not to make somebody get saved. That's the work that God does.

807
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:10,239
But we do have a responsibility to tell them. Ezekiel, he's called to be a watchman. The

808
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:18,759
watchman has a responsibility. The response of the individuals that are warned is outside

809
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:27,079
of his responsibility. If he warns them and they ignore, well, he's not responsible. But

810
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:34,079
if he fails to warn them, then God holds him responsible. This evening, we have to make

811
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,199
sure that we're purposed as we seek to give the gospel. And don't just leave conversations

812
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:44,399
and say, well, I wish I would have been able to. No, we got to be purposed in it. We got

813
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:51,039
to be kind and compassionate and loving and show the grace and mercy of God and leave

814
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,639
that door open for future opportunities. Let's pray. Father, we love you tonight. We thank

815
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:03,359
you for loving us. We thank you for your Word. We thank you for the example of Paul. As we've

816
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,759
looked at these portions of Scripture in the book of 1 Corinthians, and God, I pray that

817
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:15,839
you'd help us to be determined to preach the gospel, that we would understand that

818
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:24,279
you've given us this responsibility. Help us not to go seeking to win arguments and

819
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:35,439
display our superior knowledge. No, God, help us to go in humility and love, genuine concern

820
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:43,279
for our soul. And I pray, God, that you would use us, that we would see fruit, fruit that

821
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:53,599
would bring honor and glory to thy name. I pray, Lord, that as we go throughout the remainder

822
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,239
of this week and, Lord, as you would give us opportunities, that you would help us to

823
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,919
seize them. And God, we'd see you do a work. Well, thank you for it in Christ's name, we

824
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:04,439
pray.
