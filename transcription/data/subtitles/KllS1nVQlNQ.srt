1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
is memorizing verses, singing the song,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,519
and what a blessing.

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,280
I'm thankful for the blood that was shed for me,

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,440
and the blood that was shed for you.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,920
We all have a sin problem.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,720
All men are born sinners in need of the only savior,

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,039
the Lord Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,540
And I am so thankful that someone gave me that message

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,000
and told me that I could go to heaven,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,079
not because of anything I could do,

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,360
but all because of what Jesus had already done.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,639
Isn't that wonderful?

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,719
And so many today are trying to do all sorts of things

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,000
to try to get to heaven,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's never gonna work because Jesus already did it,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,919
and we just accept that free gift of eternal life.

17
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,599
Certainly thankful for the opportunity

18
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,279
to open up the Word of God, Acts chapter number 12,

19
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,119
this morning.

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,319
Hold your place there,

21
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,240
and then turn over to Acts chapter number one.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,200
Before we get into the text of scripture, Acts chapter 12,

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
we're gonna kinda walk through the book of Acts

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,439
and look at a number of references,

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,720
and then land in Acts chapter number 12.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,159
As you know, over the last several weeks,

27
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,300
we have been in 1 Timothy chapter number two,

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,440
and our theme for this year is continue.

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,000
We're preaching through 1 and 2 Timothy on Sunday mornings,

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,319
and here we find ourselves in the book of Acts.

31
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,480
The reason that we're in the book of Acts this morning

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,620
is because in 1 Timothy chapter two,

33
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,839
as we've looked at for the last few weeks,

34
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,319
we have addressed the subject of prayer

35
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,360
and how important prayer is.

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,559
We find that there's a priority in 1 Timothy two

37
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,800
and verse number one that is placed upon prayer.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,080
We understand the importance of having some,

39
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,819
the importance of understanding the place of prayer,

40
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,199
the privilege of prayer,

41
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,860
and we understand that this morning.

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,760
We recognize that prayer

43
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,879
should be a vital part of our lives.

44
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,540
It's a unique privilege for every child of God

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,639
to go to the throne of grace and to seek the Lord

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,519
and to obtain favor and grace and help in time of need.

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,720
We find that prayer is not a mere religious exercise.

48
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,040
It's not rote religion.

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,180
It's not memorized prayers.

50
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,279
No, we are communing with our heavenly father.

51
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,960
What a unique privilege that is

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,039
that we can enter into his presence.

53
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,740
I believe that as you study the book of Acts

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,960
and the reason that we're taking

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,039
and looking at the book of Acts this morning,

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,440
we'll get back to 1 Timothy,

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,240
but as we look at the book of Acts,

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,399
we read of the church in the first century.

59
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,580
As you read of the first century church

60
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,479
and you have an opportunity to see

61
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,119
all that was accomplished as the Lord Jesus Christ

62
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,860
was working in and through them,

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,740
you find statements such as this,

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,399
that they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

65
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,919
You find statements such as this,

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,600
that they turned the world upside down.

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,520
And as you look at the advancement of the gospel,

68
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,039
as you study the book of Acts

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,720
and you see how the gospel there in Jerusalem

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,119
goes throughout the entire known world

71
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
and as God is using the disciples

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,779
and multitudes of people are being saved

73
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:56,639
and how God is at work,

74
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,600
you begin to look at these amazing accomplishments,

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,160
but you cannot ignore the reality

76
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,539
that the first century church is a praying church.

77
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,600
The first century church is a praying church.

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,520
I'm sure that you've probably heard

79
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,800
at some point someone speaking about,

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
we're in the 21st century, get with the times,

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,199
we need to be a 21st century church and so on and so forth.

82
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,559
And I'm thankful for the modern conveniences that we have

83
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,479
and that we're sitting in a room this morning

84
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,479
that has many of those modern conveniences.

85
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,080
But understand with me this morning

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,520
that the church needs to really be a first century church,

87
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,380
not a 21st century church.

88
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,360
The church today needs to be not an entertaining church,

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,839
but a praying church.

90
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,160
And unfortunately, all across our world

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,320
and all across our land in America,

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,279
you have assemblies that are taking place

93
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,839
where it's not much more than entertainment.

94
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,600
It's mindful of what C.H. Spurgeon said

95
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,919
a couple of hundred years ago

96
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,600
that they would be entertaining the goats.

97
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,119
That's exactly what's happening all across our land.

98
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,360
And the church needs to be a praying church.

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,919
As we look in Acts chapter number one,

100
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,720
we're gonna take a walkthrough, if you will.

101
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,960
And I want you to see,

102
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,380
as we look at the early church that's a praying church,

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,119
you see all of the great accomplishments

104
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,000
and how the gospel went forth

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,559
and churches were established and missionary journeys

106
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,839
and souls saved.

107
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,160
And I mean, multitudes of people that were saved.

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,959
And man, it's exciting.

109
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,559
But a vital part of all of that is prayer.

110
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,959
They're a praying church.

111
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:39,399
Paul says that first of all, prayers and supplications,

112
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,079
the priority, the emphasis on prayer.

113
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,480
Jesus said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

114
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,600
Here in Acts chapter number one,

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,239
notice in verse number 14,

116
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:55,380
the Bible says these all continued with one accord

117
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,200
in prayer and supplication with the women

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,279
and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren.

119
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,760
So you see that there,

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,399
just after the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ,

121
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,920
that's recorded for us in verses nine through 11,

122
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,799
Jesus goes to heaven after he'd walked upon earth,

123
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,920
after his resurrection and teaching and giving instruction.

124
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,640
And we find that he ascends to heaven

125
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,399
and the Bible says these all continued

126
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,720
with one accord in prayer and supplication.

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,779
In verse number 24, the Bible says, and they prayed.

128
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,959
Notice what they prayed.

129
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,079
They said, thou Lord, then notice this phrase,

130
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,559
which knowest the hearts of all men.

131
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,239
Aren't you thankful that you serve a God who's omniscient?

132
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,779
Aren't you thankful that you serve a God

133
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,920
who knows all things?

134
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,839
And the disciples as these are gathered here,

135
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,000
these that are praying 120, they're praying

136
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,679
and they say, God, we're praying to you

137
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:51,799
and you know the hearts of all men.

138
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,500
God knows your heart this morning.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
Motives matter.

140
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,519
God knows your heart.

141
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,119
The Bible tells us the heart is deceitful

142
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,000
and desperately wicked.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,839
Who can know it?

144
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,079
In the very next verse of Jeremiah 17,

145
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
that's verse nine and verse 10 says,

146
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,600
I, the Lord, I try the heart.

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,279
He knows our hearts.

148
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,100
Notice what they pray.

149
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,019
It says, show whether of these two thou hast chosen.

150
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:15,859
You know what they're praying for?

151
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,019
They're praying for divine direction.

152
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,660
They're praying, they don't wanna get in the way.

153
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,959
They don't wanna make their own decision, their own choice.

154
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,540
They're praying that God who is omniscient,

155
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,160
who knows all things, who knows the hearts of all men,

156
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,320
that God would give them divine direction.

157
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,660
Aren't you thankful today

158
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,339
that we can still pray that prayer?

159
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,619
We can still go to God.

160
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,260
Listen, there are many times in my life,

161
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,739
I think if you'd be honest this morning,

162
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,019
there are many times in your life

163
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,940
where you just don't know what to do.

164
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,140
You can't figure it out.

165
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,660
You don't have the ability to understand

166
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,220
and you pray for that wisdom.

167
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,760
The Bible says, if any man lack wisdom,

168
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,700
let him ask of God who gives all men liberally

169
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,440
and prayeth not.

170
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,339
We find here in Acts one, the praying.

171
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,019
Notice in chapter two in verse number 42,

172
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,179
after the day of Pentecost and over 3,000 are saved

173
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,820
and what an exciting day this is

174
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,260
in the early church history and looking at the start.

175
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,500
And we find that in verse number 42,

176
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,040
the Bible says this, and they continued steadfastly

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,619
in the apostles doctrine and fellowship

178
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:23,339
and in breaking of bread and in prayers.

179
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,339
Prayer was a central vital part of the early church.

180
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,420
The early church is a praying church.

181
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,660
Notice in chapter four in verse 31,

182
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,739
we're not looking at every reference

183
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,339
with regard to prayer in the book of Acts,

184
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,320
but I wanna highlight many of these.

185
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,160
Why?

186
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,140
Because I wanna prove a point this morning.

187
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,540
In Acts four, we find that the disciples

188
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
are dealing with the religious leaders

189
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,980
and it's in this text of scripture

190
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,540
where Peter stands up with great boldness and says,

191
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,100
"'Neither is there salvation in any other,

192
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,459
"'for there is none other name under heaven given among men

193
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,760
"'whereby we must be saved.'"

194
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,140
What a great declaration of the gospel

195
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

196
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,660
And we find that in this setting and in this meeting

197
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,899
and in this really trial, if you will,

198
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,980
as they're being interrogated,

199
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,380
that they are told by the religious leaders

200
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,260
that they are no longer to speak in the name of Jesus.

201
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,179
We find that hearing that rebuke

202
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,940
from those religious leaders,

203
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,820
what they do well, they go to prayer.

204
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,940
The Bible says in verse number 24,

205
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,459
that when they heard that Peter and John

206
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,260
come back and deliver to the company,

207
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,460
to the disciples, to the church, if you will,

208
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,580
what the religious leaders said,

209
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,900
and it says that they lifted up their voice to God

210
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,820
with one accord.

211
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,859
They begin to pray.

212
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,820
They begin to seek the face of God.

213
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,419
Notice what they say in verse 24,

214
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,859
"'Lord, thou art God,

215
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:54,859
"'which hast made heaven and earth and the sea

216
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,500
"'and all that in them is.'"

217
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,940
Aren't you thankful that when you pray,

218
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,260
you're praying to the creator God?

219
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,460
Praying to the God that said,

220
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,179
let there be light, and there was light.

221
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,219
Praying to the God that we read in Genesis chapter number one

222
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,219
and God said, and it was so.

223
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,260
He not only is omniscient,

224
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,140
that he knows the hearts of all men,

225
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,739
as we see in Acts chapter number one,

226
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:18,460
but here as we see the praying church,

227
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,299
that they understood that he's omnipotent,

228
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,780
that he has all power,

229
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,140
and given the circumstances that they're facing,

230
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,380
giving that rebuke that they've received,

231
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,820
they now go to God in prayer,

232
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,739
understanding that prayer is a privilege,

233
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,140
but understanding that God hears and answers prayer.

234
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:41,780
And they say, you're God, and you're the creator.

235
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,179
Notice in verse 31,

236
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,460
and when they had prayed,

237
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,580
you know what's interesting,

238
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,539
what they prayed was that God would give them boldness.

239
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,820
Singularly, that is their prayer request

240
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,179
in this text of scripture.

241
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,979
They did not pray for deliverance,

242
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:58,460
that God would judge the religious leaders,

243
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,539
that God would, no,

244
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,380
they just.

245
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
simply prayed for boldness.

246
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,820
In the midst of this threat, we've heard what's been said,

247
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,920
God, would you grant us boldness?

248
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,480
What a great prayer request.

249
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,860
And it says in verse 31,

250
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,960
and when they had prayed, the place was shaken

251
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,360
where they were assembled together

252
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,160
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost

253
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,160
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

254
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,500
God answered prayer, why?

255
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,840
Because we have a God who hears and answers prayer.

256
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,040
We have a God who at any time,

257
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,340
we can go before that throne and we have that access

258
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,840
and we can seek his face.

259
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,380
In the early church, they're facing a situation,

260
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
they're facing some opposition

261
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,020
and we find that they go to God and God answers.

262
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,360
We notice in Acts chapter number six,

263
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,560
notice what's happening in Acts six,

264
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,460
contextually, just very quickly,

265
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,400
the threat from without the, if you will,

266
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
the persecution from without is recorded

267
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,700
in Acts four and five and now all of a sudden

268
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,340
in chapter number six, there becomes some stirring within.

269
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,900
The enemy is trying to attack from without

270
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,340
but the enemy is attacking from within.

271
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,880
And we see that in Acts chapter number six.

272
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
And so what do they do in Acts six?

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Well, they pray.

274
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,020
Because the early church was a praying church.

275
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,220
And what did the church do?

276
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,180
Well, when they had a difficulty, they prayed.

277
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,820
When they had something that they're dealing with,

278
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,320
they prayed, notice in Acts six and verse number four,

279
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,180
this is what the disciples, the apostles say,

280
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,920
Peter here and he says,

281
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,260
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer

282
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,320
and to the ministry of the word.

283
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,860
If you skip down to verse number six,

284
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,060
it says whom they set before the apostles

285
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,940
and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

286
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,640
This is really the deacons that we read of here

287
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,140
in Acts chapter number six that are appointed

288
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,500
over these matters that are being dealt with.

289
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,460
And we find the central focus of prayer

290
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,540
in Acts chapter nine after the conversion of Saul.

291
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,860
At that time, his name is Saul.

292
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,440
Of course, we know him and it often referred to him

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,880
as Paul, the apostle, the apostle to the Gentiles

294
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,500
and what a great man of God.

295
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,840
But in Acts chapter nine, he's persecuting

296
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,779
and he's got authority, but he meets Jesus, hallelujah.

297
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,980
And he gets saved, he gets born again.

298
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,440
And we find that as he gets saved and he says,

299
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Lord, who art thou?

300
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,220
He says, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

301
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,520
And God's gonna use a man.

302
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,419
The man that he's gonna use is Ananias.

303
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,160
And Ananias, of course, we're not gonna deal

304
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,320
with the entire text, but Ananias has some concern

305
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,500
because he's heard about this man, Saul

306
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
and he has a testimony that goes before him,

307
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,160
this reputation, if you will.

308
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,720
But notice what God says in Acts chapter nine

309
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,419
in verse number 11, as the Lord answers Ananias,

310
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,860
the Bible says, arise and go into the street

311
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,400
which is called Strait and inquire in the house of Judas

312
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,559
for one called Saul of Tarsus,

313
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,800
notice, for behold, he prayeth.

314
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,980
Saul's saved for just, I mean, just a short period of time

315
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,840
at this particular time in history.

316
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
And what's he doing?

317
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,980
He's praying, he's praying.

318
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,340
And in Acts chapter number 12, excuse me, Acts chapter 13,

319
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,779
we're gonna deal with Acts 12 as our text this morning,

320
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,740
but notice in Acts chapter 13,

321
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,440
this is the first missionary journey.

322
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,279
The church at Antioch, they're gonna send forth

323
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,320
the first missionaries and we find that in verse number three

324
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,260
of Acts 13, the Bible says, and when they had fasted

325
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,600
and prayed and laid their hands on them,

326
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,960
they sent them away.

327
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,160
By the way, I believe that throughout the duration

328
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,919
of this missionary journey that the church was praying

329
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,960
for the missionaries because at the end of Acts 14,

330
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,260
when they receive word that the missionaries are returning

331
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,860
to deliver a report, the church shows up

332
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,760
and the church is there and they get to hear what God did.

333
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,660
I believe this, that they get to hear

334
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,100
how God answered their prayers,

335
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,040
how God used Paul and Silas on this, Barnabas, excuse me,

336
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,880
on this missionary journey and how God worked

337
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
and they have the opportunity to hear

338
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,300
in Acts chapter 14 and verse 23,

339
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,779
before they return to the church at Antioch,

340
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,380
these missionaries, they go back to the churches

341
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,679
that were established, four of them established

342
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,480
on this first missionary journey.

343
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,020
In Acts 14 and verse 23, it says,

344
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,720
and when they had ordained them elders in every church

345
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,399
and had prayed with fasting, they commended them

346
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,000
to the Lord on whom they believed.

347
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,160
In Acts chapter 16, we find that the Bible,

348
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,600
as they arrive in Philippi, now again,

349
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,700
as they receive the direction of the Lord

350
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,760
to go into Macedonia and during

351
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,540
this second missionary journey,

352
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,540
the Bible tells us here in Acts chapter 16 and verse 16,

353
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,779
and it came to pass as we went to prayer.

354
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,320
It's a central part of the local church.

355
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,580
It's a central part of the first century church.

356
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,119
In Acts chapter 20 and verse number 36,

357
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,980
notice what the Bible says.

358
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,619
As Paul is going to depart, he's called folks together

359
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,779
so he could deliver them a message.

360
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,660
He called for the leaders of the church at Ephesus here

361
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
in this particular text, and we find

362
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,800
that as he gives them instruction

363
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,220
and gives them a charge in verse 36, it says,

364
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,959
and when he had thus spoken,

365
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,200
he kneeled down and prayed with them all.

366
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,399
And they wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him.

367
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,559
Could you imagine the scene here

368
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,980
as they had this prayer meeting before Paul would head?

369
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,820
Where's he going?

370
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,320
Well, he's heading to Jerusalem.

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,839
That's why he called for the leaders

372
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,959
of the church at Ephesus to meet him there,

373
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,320
and he's on his way to Jerusalem,

374
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,000
and we find that they have this prayer meeting.

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,360
In chapter 21 and verse number five,

376
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,160
the Bible says, and when he had accomplished those days,

377
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
we departed and went our way,

378
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,880
and they all brought us on our way with wives and children

379
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,320
till we were out of the city, and what did they do?

380
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,559
Before they left, it says,

381
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,559
and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed and prayed.

382
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
We could look at more examples this morning,

383
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,239
but I hope at this point,

384
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,619
after reading this number of verses,

385
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,200
that you would agree with me

386
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,880
that the early church was a praying church,

387
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,200
that you would agree this morning

388
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,020
that the early church believed in,

389
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,279
but also practiced prayer.

390
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,880
You know, a lot of people can believe in things,

391
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,559
but never actually do it.

392
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,920
We believe in the power of prayer,

393
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,800
but how often do we pray?

394
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
How often do we pray?

395
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
Do we only pray when there's an urgent matter,

396
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,640
or are we people of prayer?

397
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,720
The Bible says that we're to pray always.

398
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,959
Pray without ceasing, in 1 Thessalonians.

399
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,320
Be dealing with that this Wednesday evening, actually.

400
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,440
Begin to look at this early church

401
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
and understand the fact that they believed in

402
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,040
and practiced, they believed in prayer,

403
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,239
individually and corporately.

404
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,360
You know, it's a blessing to be able

405
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,080
to go to God on your own.

406
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,399
There's one God and one mediator between God and man,

407
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,239
the man Christ Jesus.

408
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm thankful that any time, at any place,

409
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,220
for any reason, I can go to God in prayer, and so can you.

410
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,160
You don't need some intercessor.

411
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,040
You don't need to have some mediator.

412
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,480
No, Jesus Christ is our mediator,

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
and we go to the Father through the Son,

414
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,119
and what a blessing to understand that truth.

415
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,679
We find this morning that though we can gather,

416
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,040
or we can individually go to God in prayer,

417
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,160
we understand the emphasis as we look here

418
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,619
in the book of Acts, that prayer is not just individual,

419
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:48,160
but it's corporate, corporate prayer.

420
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,239
Turn over to Acts 12.

421
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,480
I asked you to begin there,

422
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
and we're gonna look at this text of Scripture.

423
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,160
For some, it's a familiar passage of Scripture.

424
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,080
We're gonna go through this passage of Scripture

425
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,279
here this morning, verses one through 19,

426
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,480
and I wanna look at a praying church.

427
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,100
In Acts 12, in verse number one,

428
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,940
the Bible says,

429
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,880
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands

430
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,800
to vex certain of the church,

431
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,679
and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.

432
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,440
And so we see the opposition again.

433
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,739
We see what's taking place,

434
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:25,520
and we see the death of James at the hand of Herod.

435
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,360
The Bible tells us in verse number three,

436
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,540
and because he, that's speaking of Herod,

437
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,440
saw that it, what's it?

438
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
Well, the killing of James,

439
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
this opposition that he led in this persecution,

440
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,419
this martyrdom, that it pleased the Jews.

441
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,080
The Jews are pleased at what's taking place.

442
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,880
The Bible says in verse number three

443
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
that he proceeded further to take Peter also.

444
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,119
James has been killed, according to verse number two,

445
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,559
and Herod, he says,

446
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,679
Man, this has pleased these people.

447
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,679
So guess what?

448
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,099
I'm gonna take Peter also.

449
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,479
Peter's a great leader in the church,

450
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,039
and so the Bible says that these then,

451
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,119
at the end of verse number three,

452
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,020
were the days of unleavened bread.

453
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,020
So God gives us insight with regard to the timing,

454
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,599
with regard to when this happened,

455
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,960
and it says when he had apprehended him.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,599
And so we find that Peter is apprehended by Herod,

457
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,080
according to verse number four,

458
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,520
and Herod puts him into prison.

459
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,119
It says he put him in prison

460
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,960
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers

461
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,479
to keep him.

462
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:41,200
Notice, intending after Easter

463
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,080
to bring him forth to the people.

464
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,039
When he's gonna bring him forth,

465
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,280
you know what he's gonna do?

466
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
He's gonna kill him.

467
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,919
That's what he's gonna do.

468
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,200
Because of what was going on,

469
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,479
he had killed James,

470
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,840
and the timing wasn't right to kill Peter,

471
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,919
but he saw that it pleased the Jews,

472
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,760
and so he says.

473
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:09,320
So I'm going to apprehend Peter and I'm going to incarcerate Peter so that I can kill Peter.

474
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,200
He delivers him to these soldiers and he's kept in ward.

475
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
He's in prison.

476
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,860
But I want you to notice verse number 5.

477
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,800
The Bible says Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing

478
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,400
of the church unto God for him.

479
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,960
We see in verses 1 through 4, really verses 1 through 5, the situation.

480
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,800
If you're taking notes this morning, notice the situation with me.

481
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,040
And here's what I want you to understand this morning.

482
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,320
The church, the early church, the first century church, they had situations the same way every

483
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,840
church, every individual has situations.

484
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,140
You're a family, you have situations, you have circumstances, you have difficulties

485
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
that arise.

486
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,680
You're a church family, you have situations, you have things that you deal with.

487
00:20:52,680 --> 00:21:00,360
As an individual, we have situations, matters, circumstances that we deal with.

488
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,340
And as we look here in Acts chapter number 12, we find that in the first five verses

489
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,960
that God allows us to have an insight and understanding, if you will, to the situation

490
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
that the church faced.

491
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,120
We mentioned already that in Acts chapter number 4, they were facing a different situation.

492
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,560
The situation was a threat that you no longer can speak in the name of Jesus.

493
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
So, at the circumstances that are presented in Acts chapter number 4, what did they do?

494
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Well, they went to prayer.

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,240
And here in Acts chapter number 5, as God reveals to us the situation, we see that it's

496
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,200
a serious matter.

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,080
I want you to think about, we're reading this as historical documentation.

498
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
This is an accurate historical account that God has given to us.

499
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,120
But I want you to think about being in this church.

500
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,800
I want you to think about being there and understanding what's taking place.

501
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,600
And I want you to consider with me this morning that you're in a situation and you've seen

502
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,280
James killed.

503
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,200
And you understand the power and the authority that Herod has, and you see that the Jews

504
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
are pleased with it.

505
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,480
And by the way, these are the same Jews that in chapter number 4 were saying, you can't

506
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,520
speak in his name any longer.

507
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,960
And they're pleased that Herod is now putting them to death.

508
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,080
And Peter, Peter is taken, he's incarcerated.

509
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,360
Peter's a leader of the church.

510
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,680
By the way, the enemy knows how to work.

511
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,240
The enemy knows how to work.

512
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,160
But I'm thankful that the church had been given some instruction, the church understood

513
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,800
some things, the people, they understand the importance of prayer, they see the circumstances,

514
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,360
they see what's taking place.

515
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
And in this situation, I want you to put yourselves there.

516
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
I want you to think about being there.

517
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
How would you feel?

518
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,680
What would your response be?

519
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,920
See oftentimes we'll use little catch phrases, if you will, cliches, that prayer should be

520
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,420
our first response and not our last resort and those types of things.

521
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:12,920
But the reality this morning is that in many of our lives, prayer is not our first response.

522
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,600
And there are many times in our lives that we lean on our own understanding that we try

523
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,120
to figure out how we can change the circumstances, how we can maybe manipulate the circumstances.

524
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
How can we get Peter out of here?

525
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,880
And maybe this morning if we're in this situation and collectively this is our church and we're

526
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,140
dealing with this situation and we have a meeting and we say, okay, we gotta come up

527
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
with a plan.

528
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,320
How are we gonna get our pastor, our leader out of prison?

529
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
What are we gonna do?

530
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
What are some things that we can do?

531
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,000
We begin to brainstorm, we begin to come up with ideas and we're gonna have this covert

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
operation and someone's...

533
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,120
Sometimes that's how we think.

534
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,560
Sometimes that's how we behave.

535
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,000
We lean on our own understanding.

536
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,760
We're trying to figure things out ourselves.

537
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,640
Listen, we're all guilty of it.

538
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,320
We've all been there.

539
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
We've all had situations.

540
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,120
We see the situation of the early church.

541
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,920
We understand in Acts 12 the stakes are high.

542
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Peter is going to be put to death.

543
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
Herod is not playing games.

544
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
What do we do?

545
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,600
How do we respond?

546
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm thankful for the privilege of prayer.

547
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,119
I'm thankful for a praying church because we see the situation but then we see the supplication

548
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,760
and really begins in verse number five and as we go through the text of Scripture, notice

549
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,559
the Bible says, therefore, Peter therefore was kept in prison.

550
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,440
But I want you to notice what the Bible says, but prayer was made notice without ceasing

551
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,680
of the church unto God for him.

552
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,839
You know how the church, the early church, the first century church, you know how they

553
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,839
respond to the situation?

554
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,839
They prayed.

555
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,720
They said, we gotta have a prayer meeting.

556
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,200
We gotta have a prayer meeting.

557
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
This is urgent.

558
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,040
By the way, I think a lot of people showed up for the prayer meeting.

559
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,720
They believed in prayer.

560
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,040
You know, that's fine that you're going to gather over there, but I'm just going to pray

561
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
at home.

562
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,360
No, there's something about corporate prayer.

563
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,800
They got together and they prayed.

564
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,200
We see in verse number six, this is when Herod would have brought him forth, Peter, what's

565
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,119
he bringing him forth for?

566
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,119
What's the purpose?

567
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,119
Well, to kill him.

568
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,720
And the Bible says the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers.

569
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,000
By the way, what a great picture of the peace of God.

570
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,180
Amen?

571
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,839
God tells us about a peace that passeth all understanding.

572
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,520
Jesus said, my peace I give unto thee, not as the world giveth give I unto thee.

573
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,320
He said, my peace, I think about the peace of God.

574
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,119
And Peter, he saw that James was killed.

575
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,220
He knew what Herod's purpose and intentions were.

576
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,080
And we find that Peter is asleep between a couple of soldiers.

577
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,040
The peace of God.

578
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
The peace of God.

579
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,640
Listen, I don't know what you're dealing with this morning, but I know the peace of God.

580
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
Peace does not mean the absence of trouble.

581
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,000
See, there's a lot of people that think that they could just have peace if all of their

582
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,680
troubles would go away.

583
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,920
Peace is not found in the absence of trouble.

584
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Peace is found in the person of Jesus Christ.

585
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,279
He is our peace.

586
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,640
And the Bible tells us, commands us in the book of Colossians that we're to let the peace

587
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,440
of God rule in our hearts.

588
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
You know what that means?

589
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,040
That's an action we have to take.

590
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Why?

591
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,080
Because sometimes we're dealing with situations where chaos wants to rule in your heart.

592
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,000
Where doubt wants to rule in your heart.

593
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,200
God says let the peace of God rule in your heart.

594
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,119
Wow, hallelujah, for the peace of God.

595
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,119
He's sleeping.

596
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:11,660
And the Bible says in verse number 6 that He's bound with two chains in the keepers

597
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,320
before the door kept the prison.

598
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,760
And so again in your mind's eye if you can see the situation we're told of four soldiers

599
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,920
in verse number 4 and what's happening is Peter is in this cell and he's got two soldiers

600
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,520
that are chained to him and then there are two soldiers that are watching guard at the

601
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,559
door.

602
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,279
You think Herod was serious?

603
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,279
You think he wanted to make sure he was going to be able to fulfill his desire in killing

604
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,279
Peter?

605
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,279
Absolutely.

606
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,680
He puts everything in place that he could.

607
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,580
By the way it reminds me of what happened a little while earlier with the Lord Jesus

608
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,320
Christ and they came to Pilate and they said, they called our Savior a deceiver and how

609
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,740
terrible that is.

610
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,200
But they say we know what this deceiver said before he died.

611
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
He said that he was going to rise again and so we want you to set a watch and make it

612
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
sure.

613
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,279
And Pilate said you have it, set it as sure as you can and they did everything they could.

614
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,279
But guess what?

615
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,800
The stone rolled away.

616
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,960
Hallelujah.

617
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,520
The grave it could not keep him.

618
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,260
They did everything they could.

619
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,800
But Christ rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

620
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,160
And here Herod he makes every preparation possible to keep Peter secure within this

621
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,920
particular prison cell and we find that he's got two soldiers that are chained to him.

622
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,520
He's got two soldiers that are outside of the cell door and the Bible says in verse

623
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:34,640
7, and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and light shined in the prison and he

624
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
smote Peter on the side.

625
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
I like it when it says that.

626
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,799
You ever have to smite someone to wake them up?

627
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,799
Amen?

628
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,799
I remember Elijah, he's here this morning.

629
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,880
We were at camp several years ago.

630
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,320
You guys were just junior campers and his cousin went with us and his cousin wouldn't

631
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,479
get up one morning and he said I got it and he went in there and he just smacked that

632
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,200
young man and woke him up.

633
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Got him out of bed.

634
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Amen?

635
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,239
And I wasn't going to get away with that but Elijah took care of it and that young man

636
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,239
got up out of bed.

637
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,239
Amen?

638
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:06,640
And the Bible says here that he smote Peter on the side and raised him up saying arise

639
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,000
up quickly.

640
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Notice the Bible says that his chains fell off from his hands.

641
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,720
And the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did.

642
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,040
And he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me.

643
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,320
And he went out and he followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the

644
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,520
angel but thought he saw a vision.

645
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,040
You ever dream at night and your dream might be so vivid that you think it's real?

646
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,239
I mean Peter's in a position here where he almost thinks he's dreaming, he's having a

647
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,840
vision.

648
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,400
And I want you to see that in verse number 10 it says and when they were past the first

649
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,400
and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city, notice what

650
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,080
it says, which opened to them of his own accord.

651
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,799
They went out and passed on through one street.

652
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,239
forthwith the angel departed from him." You say, that's just not possible. You don't know

653
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:11,119
the God that I know. He's the God of the impossible. He's the God of the impossible. He said, nothing

654
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:17,719
is too hard for me. How did the gate open? God opened the gate. That's what God can do.

655
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:24,439
I want you to understand why all of this is taking place. The church is praying. The church

656
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:30,079
is praying. They're in a prayer meeting. They don't know at this moment as we're reading

657
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,319
the text of Scripture, they don't know what's happening in the prison cell. They don't know

658
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,079
that Peter was asleep between two prison guards and that the angel of the Lord came and smote

659
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:45,079
him and the chains fell off and he's walking. They don't know that. They're praying. They're

660
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:51,399
praying. I don't know exactly what they're praying. All of us can use our sanctified

661
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,959
imaginations and we can be creative to think of different things that they might have been

662
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:59,719
praying. But I'm not sure that any of them prayed that God would you just smite them

663
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:04,479
and cause those chains to fall off and just open the gates and let them. I don't know

664
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:09,319
that they prayed exactly that way. But that's why we take and cherish the prayer promise

665
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,719
that God gives us in Ephesians 3.20, now unto him that is able to exceeding abundantly above

666
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:21,479
all that we ask or think. I don't know if I were, now that we have the record of Acts

667
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:27,359
12, we may pray this way. But without the record of Acts 12, we may not pray in that

668
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,959
same regard, but we have a God who's able to do exceeding abundantly above. And we find

669
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:38,559
that as the church is having this prayer meeting and we see that God is working again, they

670
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,439
do not even know what God is doing and how God has answered their prayer. We find in

671
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:48,519
verse number 11 that when Peter was come to himself, now think about that. He's been smitten

672
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,999
by the angel of the Lord to wake up and to get out of that prison. He goes out and I

673
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:57,159
mean the doors open and the gate opens and the Bible says in verse number 12, when he

674
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:04,159
came to himself. No, this isn't a vision. No, this isn't a dream. No, this is reality.

675
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:12,999
I'm delivered. I'm not in that cell anymore. Man, hallelujah. The Bible says in verse 12,

676
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:20,879
here's what he said. Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath

677
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:28,599
delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of

678
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:35,599
the Jews. He says this in verse 12, and when he had considered the thing, he came to the

679
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:42,759
house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark. Now notice this, where many were

680
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:50,079
gathered together praying. The Bible told us in verse number 5, but prayer was made

681
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,079
without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And the Bible tells us that after God

682
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,959
heard their prayer, after God was working miraculously, after he's answered their prayer

683
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:08,039
and he's delivered Peter in such a miraculous way as we've read the text of Scripture, that

684
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,199
Peter considers the thing and he says, I'm going to go over here to this particular house

685
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:17,399
and he goes, and the Bible tells us that there are many that are there praying. They're

686
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:22,999
gathered together and they're praying. It's an all-night prayer meeting. An all-night

687
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:28,759
prayer meeting. What a blessing. You know, there was a time in our nation's history that

688
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,719
our churches had all-night prayer meetings. There are some that still do today, and I'm

689
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:41,719
thankful for that. An all-night prayer meeting. By the way, I don't think it's a prayer meeting

690
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:49,199
is a bad idea. We need prayer. We need to be a praying church. We have a one-hour prayer

691
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,359
meeting on Wednesday evening. And I don't mean to insult anyone, but I said this a few

692
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:02,359
weeks ago, you have a one-hour prayer meeting and half the people show up. Our actions speak

693
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,679
louder than our words. What do we believe about prayer? We're a praying church. We

694
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:15,959
go to a conference every year in July. We're just at a retreat for a pastor retreat. We

695
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:21,799
go to a pastor's conference. Completely different. I mean, as far from one end of the spectrum

696
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:26,239
to the other are these two meetings that we go to. But this meeting that we go to in July,

697
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,079
it's a pastor's conference. Super, super busy schedule. Lots of preaching and all sorts

698
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,239
of instructional classes and different things that we go to. And it's an exciting time.

699
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,959
But that church up there, it's where Breonna's going to college right now. That church up

700
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:46,720
there in preparation for that pastor's conference, they have an all-night prayer meeting. Leading

701
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,319
up to that all-night prayer meeting, they have a 24-hour prayer thing that's going on

702
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:56,479
where they're not gathered at the local church, but they have people that sign up for certain

703
00:34:56,479 --> 00:35:01,399
times of the day and they're praying. They have time slots. I'm going to pray from 2

704
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:06,639
to 3 a.m. I'm going to pray from 7 to 8 p.m., whatever the times are. And they have that

705
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,479
set up. And then they finish that week of those prayer meetings and people praying individually

706
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:18,519
at certain times and they come together and they have an all-night church prayer meeting.

707
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:25,399
God hears and answers prayer. Prayer is a unique privilege as a child of God. I fear

708
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:32,559
this morning that prayer is neglected in our society today. It's probably 25 years ago

709
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,720
now. It was actually 26 years ago now. I've told this story before, but 26 years ago my

710
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,720
dad was doing a men's prayer breakfast and he was teaching at that men's prayer breakfast.

711
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
He was teaching on prayer and he went to a Bible bookstore. He'd only been saved for

712
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,720
a short time. He was going to a Bible bookstore to try to pick up a book on prayer in order

713
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,319
to be able to use some things and teach on the subject of prayer. And as he was looking

714
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:02,279
in that Christian bookstore, he found a book that was titled, How to Pray, in nine minutes

715
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:11,159
and 59 seconds. And really what was communicated even through the title of that book was really

716
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,440
indicative of the society, the culture that we live in. We want everything to be right

717
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:28,559
now. Prayer is work. Prayer is labor. How many of you know the song, Sweet Hour of Prayer?

718
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:36,759
Sweet Hour of Prayer. I've said this before as well. Unfortunately in the 21st century,

719
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:42,679
it's as if we've exchanged a sweet hour of prayer for just a little talk with Jesus.

720
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:49,279
And that's another song that you may be familiar with. Sweet Hour of Prayer. Sweet Hour of

721
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:55,720
Prayer. It's interesting to me in Acts chapter number 12 that Peter is in prison. The church

722
00:36:55,759 --> 00:37:02,440
is assembled, as the Bible tells us here, at the house of Mary, the mother of John.

723
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,359
And they're assembled there and praying. And Peter's in prison. They don't know what's

724
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,440
going on with Peter. And Peter doesn't know all that's going on there. But he comes to

725
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,119
the house. And in verse number 13, the Bible says, As Peter knocked at the door of the

726
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,559
gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And so Peter is there knocking at the door

727
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,559
of the gate. And Rhoda comes to answer, I don't know the time. We find that as you

728
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:32,399
look throughout the text of Scripture, that the Bible would tell us that Peter is there.

729
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:37,639
He's sleeping. He's in between those soldiers and all that's taking place. And we find that

730
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,839
he's knocking at the door. And in verse number 14, it says, And when she knew Peter's voice,

731
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,759
how many of you ever had somebody knock at your door, especially at an unexpected time,

732
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:50,319
an unexpected hour, you're not expecting someone, someone knocks and you might say something

733
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:54,679
like this. We have rings today. I get it. But maybe, if you can think back a few years,

734
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:59,919
you say, who's there? Any of you remember that? One day I'll be preaching in 25 years

735
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:03,839
and I'll use something like that. And young people are going to look at me like, why would

736
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,199
you say who's there? Just take out your phone and look at your da-da-da-da, right? I mean,

737
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:14,000
you understand what I'm saying? But many of us still today, we can recall saying, who's

738
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,559
there? The Bible says that when she knew Peter's voice. You ever been in a situation

739
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,720
where you can know who the person is just by hearing their voice? You know their voice.

740
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,399
You're familiar with their voice. And she knew the voice and notice what the Bible says.

741
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:38,119
She opened not the gate for gladness. That always makes me laugh when I read verse 14.

742
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,959
But it says that she ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate. I see this young lady,

743
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:49,839
this damsel. I don't know her specific age, but she's so filled with excitement. She's

744
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,320
so overjoyed that she doesn't open the door. She goes and runs and tells those that are

745
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,959
praying. Remember, they were gathered together praying. They weren't sitting around watching

746
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:06,039
something. I know they didn't have TV, but they're not sitting around playing games and

747
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:15,799
doing whatever. No, they're praying. They're praying. And Rhoda says that Peter stood before

748
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:23,479
the gate. Notice the response. It says in verse 15, and they said unto her, Thou art

749
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:38,440
mad. Crazy. Crazy. You ever pray and God answers and you just can't maybe believe it?

750
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,919
God likes to answer that way, by the way. Prove His power. They say, Thou art mad. But

751
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:51,000
notice what it says. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is

752
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,359
His angel. But Peter continued knocking. Think about the persistence of Peter. He just continued

753
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,839
knocking. I'm not sure how long the conversation took. I'm not sure.

754
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:05,699
of all the interaction, but the Bible says that he continued knocking there and the Bible

755
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:14,699
says that when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. They were astonished.

756
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:20,459
Listen, I understand sometimes today we may act like and we may pretend that we're not

757
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,139
astonished when God answers prayer because we know that God is able to. Listen, when

758
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:31,579
God answers in a great way, you'll be astonished. Your faith will be increased. You will have

759
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:37,799
joy. It's not that you were praying with unbelief. It's not that you were praying with doubting.

760
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:45,459
You're just astonished to see what God was able to do because God often works in such

761
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:52,659
a way that would cause his people to stand in awe of who he is. And that's what I believe

762
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:59,699
happens here. Notice what happens in verse 17. They were astonished. I'm not sure how,

763
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,699
what they said, but in verse 17 it says, but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold

764
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:08,819
their peace. I think there were a lot of questions. There was some, you ever, I mean, what's going,

765
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:14,459
Peter, what happened? How did you? I think that's what happens. That's what I would be

766
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:20,659
wondering. Peter, what happened? How did you get here? And it says that he was beckoning

767
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:25,579
unto them to hold their peace. And then notice the Bible says he declared unto them how the

768
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:30,859
Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, go, show these things unto James

769
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:34,859
and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place. Obviously there's a, it's

770
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,019
a different James. It's not the James that was killed at the beginning of the text. But

771
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:46,939
we find here that, that Peter, the verse 17 is a short verse. But what we read from verse

772
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:53,219
six down through verse number 11 is what Peter's rehearsing to them. What God did.

773
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,539
Because it says that he declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

774
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:04,619
Isn't it exciting when God answers prayer? In verse 18 it says, now as soon as it was

775
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:09,559
day, there was no small stir among the soldiers that was become, what was become of Peter.

776
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:20,319
Can you imagine the soldiers when they awakened? I mean, if you were chained to Peter and you

777
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:28,679
opened your eyes and Peter wasn't there, how would you feel? Knowing that you're going

778
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,999
to have to give an account, by the way. Maybe you'd ask the two guys that were watching

779
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:38,199
the door, hey, what happened to Peter? Did you see him leave? What's going on? I mean,

780
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:51,119
could there be confusion? A level of concern? Stress? It says, there was no small stir

781
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,919
among the soldiers. Verse 19, and when Herod had sought for him and found him not, he examined

782
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,959
the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to

783
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:08,639
Caesarea and their abode. Why did he command that they be put to death? Because they had

784
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,999
a prisoner that was no longer there. It was a serious consequence. I want you to understand

785
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:23,439
this morning that God is able to work in such a way, not only would He cause us to rejoice,

786
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:29,559
but the lost people are able to sit there and say, I don't know how this happened. Previously,

787
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,959
if you look in Acts 4 and Acts 5, those that were apprehended, they weren't there. Where

788
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:40,559
are they? Well, they're preaching. How'd they get there? God delivered them. This morning,

789
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,879
I said it in the beginning of the message, the 21st century church, we need to stop trying

790
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:58,599
to be an entertaining church. We need to be a praying church. A praying church. This morning,

791
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:05,359
as we look at the admonition from 1 Timothy chapter 2, and we've studied it the last several

792
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,999
weeks, Paul makes it very clear in the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, I exhort therefore that

793
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:17,799
first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

794
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:21,999
You skip down to verse 8, it says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting

795
00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:28,959
up holy hands without wrath and doubting. As you study the book of Acts, you say, man,

796
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:35,319
how did they accomplish everything that they accomplished? Well, there are several keys

797
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:39,199
I believe that God gives us as we study the book of Acts. They were filled with the Spirit

798
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,799
of God. They believed in imminent return after they saw Him ascend and heard the angel say

799
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:51,919
He's coming back. But I want you to understand they were a praying church. And God hears

800
00:44:51,919 --> 00:45:00,799
and answers prayer. God delights in showing Himself mighty. And we, we need to be a praying

801
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:08,959
church, individually and corporately. A praying church. I believe this morning, this book,

802
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:15,959
there are many prayer promises that God gives us. Many accounts of God's people praying

803
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:21,839
and God answering. What we need, we need to see God work. It is time, the psalmist said,

804
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,399
for thee, O Lord, to work. You know what moves the hand of God? The prayers of His

805
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:32,879
people. The prayers of His people. This morning, just like the book of Acts and the first century

806
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:38,959
church was a praying church, we today, in 2024, we need to be a praying church. A praying

807
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:45,119
church. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank

808
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,399
You for the privilege of being able to have a Bible, to be able to study Thy Word, to

809
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:55,159
go through and to see how You worked and what You did. Lord, we stand in awe of reading

810
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:01,099
this account in Acts 12. For some this morning, they've heard it before. For others, perhaps,

811
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:06,119
this morning is the first time they ever heard this passage of Scripture. They heard about

812
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,919
the persecution, but they heard, as you think about the situation there that the church

813
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:18,959
was facing, and they had the opportunity to hear about the supplication, the church praying.

814
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:24,519
You working and answering and delivering miraculously. God, how we stand in awe of

815
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:33,399
who You are. I pray this morning that we would respond, just as we've been ready to receive.

816
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:36,879
God that You would challenge us in our own personal lives, corporately that You would

817
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:45,319
challenge us with this area of prayer. That as the early church is characterized as being

818
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:50,479
a praying church, the Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton would be characterized as

819
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:58,519
being a praying church. God, we believe this morning that You hear and answer prayer. And

820
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:05,079
I pray that that belief would be evidenced in our behavior because what we do speaks

821
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:13,079
louder than what we say. God, I pray that our families, that their children would see

822
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:23,039
their parents' belief in prayer. Prayer is a vital part of our lives. I pray that in

823
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,719
these moments of invitation, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they do not know

824
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,679
with 100% confidence that heaven is their home. And I pray that we'd have an opportunity

825
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,039
to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home. God,

826
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,599
I pray for every child of God. Would You help us to be responsive this morning? We'll give

827
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,759
You the honor and glory for all that You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would

828
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:50,559
You stand with me? At the end of each of our services, we have an invitation where we give
