WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
is memorizing verses, singing the song,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.519
and what a blessing.

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:06.280
I'm thankful for the blood that was shed for me,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.440
and the blood that was shed for you.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.920
We all have a sin problem.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.720
All men are born sinners in need of the only savior,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.039
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.540
And I am so thankful that someone gave me that message

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.000
and told me that I could go to heaven,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.079
not because of anything I could do,

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.360
but all because of what Jesus had already done.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.639
Isn't that wonderful?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.719
And so many today are trying to do all sorts of things

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.000
to try to get to heaven,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and it's never gonna work because Jesus already did it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.919
and we just accept that free gift of eternal life.

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:41.599
Certainly thankful for the opportunity

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.279
to open up the Word of God, Acts chapter number 12,

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:45.119
this morning.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.319
Hold your place there,

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.240
and then turn over to Acts chapter number one.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.200
Before we get into the text of scripture, Acts chapter 12,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
we're gonna kinda walk through the book of Acts

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.439
and look at a number of references,

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.720
and then land in Acts chapter number 12.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.159
As you know, over the last several weeks,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.300
we have been in 1 Timothy chapter number two,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.440
and our theme for this year is continue.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.000
We're preaching through 1 and 2 Timothy on Sunday mornings,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.319
and here we find ourselves in the book of Acts.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.480
The reason that we're in the book of Acts this morning

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.620
is because in 1 Timothy chapter two,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.839
as we've looked at for the last few weeks,

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:23.319
we have addressed the subject of prayer

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.360
and how important prayer is.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.559
We find that there's a priority in 1 Timothy two

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:30.800
and verse number one that is placed upon prayer.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.080
We understand the importance of having some,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.819
the importance of understanding the place of prayer,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.199
the privilege of prayer,

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.860
and we understand that this morning.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.760
We recognize that prayer

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.879
should be a vital part of our lives.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.540
It's a unique privilege for every child of God

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.639
to go to the throne of grace and to seek the Lord

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.519
and to obtain favor and grace and help in time of need.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:59.720
We find that prayer is not a mere religious exercise.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.040
It's not rote religion.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.180
It's not memorized prayers.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.279
No, we are communing with our heavenly father.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.960
What a unique privilege that is

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.039
that we can enter into his presence.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.740
I believe that as you study the book of Acts

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.960
and the reason that we're taking

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.039
and looking at the book of Acts this morning,

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.440
we'll get back to 1 Timothy,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.240
but as we look at the book of Acts,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.399
we read of the church in the first century.

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.580
As you read of the first century church

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.479
and you have an opportunity to see

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.119
all that was accomplished as the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.860
was working in and through them,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740
you find statements such as this,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.399
that they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.919
You find statements such as this,

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.600
that they turned the world upside down.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.520
And as you look at the advancement of the gospel,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.039
as you study the book of Acts

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.720
and you see how the gospel there in Jerusalem

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.119
goes throughout the entire known world

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.440
and as God is using the disciples

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.779
and multitudes of people are being saved

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.639
and how God is at work,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.600
you begin to look at these amazing accomplishments,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.160
but you cannot ignore the reality

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.539
that the first century church is a praying church.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.600
The first century church is a praying church.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.520
I'm sure that you've probably heard

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.800
at some point someone speaking about,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.440
we're in the 21st century, get with the times,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.199
we need to be a 21st century church and so on and so forth.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.559
And I'm thankful for the modern conveniences that we have

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:28.479
and that we're sitting in a room this morning

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.479
that has many of those modern conveniences.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.080
But understand with me this morning

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.520
that the church needs to really be a first century church,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.380
not a 21st century church.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.360
The church today needs to be not an entertaining church,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.839
but a praying church.

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.160
And unfortunately, all across our world

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.320
and all across our land in America,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.279
you have assemblies that are taking place

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.839
where it's not much more than entertainment.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.600
It's mindful of what C.H. Spurgeon said

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.919
a couple of hundred years ago

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.600
that they would be entertaining the goats.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.119
That's exactly what's happening all across our land.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.360
And the church needs to be a praying church.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.919
As we look in Acts chapter number one,

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.720
we're gonna take a walkthrough, if you will.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.960
And I want you to see,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.380
as we look at the early church that's a praying church,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.119
you see all of the great accomplishments

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:20.000
and how the gospel went forth

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.559
and churches were established and missionary journeys

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:23.839
and souls saved.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.160
And I mean, multitudes of people that were saved.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.959
And man, it's exciting.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.559
But a vital part of all of that is prayer.

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:34.959
They're a praying church.

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:39.399
Paul says that first of all, prayers and supplications,

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:43.079
the priority, the emphasis on prayer.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.480
Jesus said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:49.600
Here in Acts chapter number one,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.239
notice in verse number 14,

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:55.380
the Bible says these all continued with one accord

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.200
in prayer and supplication with the women

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.279
and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.760
So you see that there,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.399
just after the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.920
that's recorded for us in verses nine through 11,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.799
Jesus goes to heaven after he'd walked upon earth,

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:15.920
after his resurrection and teaching and giving instruction.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.640
And we find that he ascends to heaven

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.399
and the Bible says these all continued

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.720
with one accord in prayer and supplication.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.779
In verse number 24, the Bible says, and they prayed.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:27.959
Notice what they prayed.

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:31.079
They said, thou Lord, then notice this phrase,

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:34.559
which knowest the hearts of all men.

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.239
Aren't you thankful that you serve a God who's omniscient?

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:38.779
Aren't you thankful that you serve a God

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:39.920
who knows all things?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.839
And the disciples as these are gathered here,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.000
these that are praying 120, they're praying

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.679
and they say, God, we're praying to you

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.799
and you know the hearts of all men.

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:53.500
God knows your heart this morning.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.920
Motives matter.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.519
God knows your heart.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.119
The Bible tells us the heart is deceitful

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:00.000
and desperately wicked.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.839
Who can know it?

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.079
In the very next verse of Jeremiah 17,

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.519
that's verse nine and verse 10 says,

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:06.600
I, the Lord, I try the heart.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.279
He knows our hearts.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.100
Notice what they pray.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.019
It says, show whether of these two thou hast chosen.

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.859
You know what they're praying for?

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:18.019
They're praying for divine direction.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.660
They're praying, they don't wanna get in the way.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.959
They don't wanna make their own decision, their own choice.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.540
They're praying that God who is omniscient,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.160
who knows all things, who knows the hearts of all men,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.320
that God would give them divine direction.

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:32.660
Aren't you thankful today

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.339
that we can still pray that prayer?

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:35.619
We can still go to God.

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.260
Listen, there are many times in my life,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.739
I think if you'd be honest this morning,

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:40.019
there are many times in your life

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.940
where you just don't know what to do.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.140
You can't figure it out.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.660
You don't have the ability to understand

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.220
and you pray for that wisdom.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.760
The Bible says, if any man lack wisdom,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.700
let him ask of God who gives all men liberally

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.440
and prayeth not.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.339
We find here in Acts one, the praying.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.019
Notice in chapter two in verse number 42,

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:03.179
after the day of Pentecost and over 3,000 are saved

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:05.820
and what an exciting day this is

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.260
in the early church history and looking at the start.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.500
And we find that in verse number 42,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.040
the Bible says this, and they continued steadfastly

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.619
in the apostles doctrine and fellowship

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:23.339
and in breaking of bread and in prayers.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:28.339
Prayer was a central vital part of the early church.

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.420
The early church is a praying church.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.660
Notice in chapter four in verse 31,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.739
we're not looking at every reference

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:37.339
with regard to prayer in the book of Acts,

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.320
but I wanna highlight many of these.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.160
Why?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.140
Because I wanna prove a point this morning.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.540
In Acts four, we find that the disciples

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540
are dealing with the religious leaders

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.980
and it's in this text of scripture

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.540
where Peter stands up with great boldness and says,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.100
"'Neither is there salvation in any other,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.459
"'for there is none other name under heaven given among men

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:59.760
"'whereby we must be saved.'"

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.140
What a great declaration of the gospel

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.140
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.660
And we find that in this setting and in this meeting

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.899
and in this really trial, if you will,

00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:11.980
as they're being interrogated,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.380
that they are told by the religious leaders

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.260
that they are no longer to speak in the name of Jesus.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.179
We find that hearing that rebuke

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:22.940
from those religious leaders,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.820
what they do well, they go to prayer.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.940
The Bible says in verse number 24,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.459
that when they heard that Peter and John

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:31.260
come back and deliver to the company,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.460
to the disciples, to the church, if you will,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.580
what the religious leaders said,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.900
and it says that they lifted up their voice to God

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.820
with one accord.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.859
They begin to pray.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.820
They begin to seek the face of God.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.419
Notice what they say in verse 24,

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:50.859
"'Lord, thou art God,

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:54.859
"'which hast made heaven and earth and the sea

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:57.500
"'and all that in them is.'"

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.940
Aren't you thankful that when you pray,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.260
you're praying to the creator God?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.460
Praying to the God that said,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.179
let there be light, and there was light.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.219
Praying to the God that we read in Genesis chapter number one

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:09.219
and God said, and it was so.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.260
He not only is omniscient,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.140
that he knows the hearts of all men,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.739
as we see in Acts chapter number one,

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:18.460
but here as we see the praying church,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.299
that they understood that he's omnipotent,

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:22.780
that he has all power,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.140
and given the circumstances that they're facing,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.380
giving that rebuke that they've received,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.820
they now go to God in prayer,

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:33.739
understanding that prayer is a privilege,

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:37.140
but understanding that God hears and answers prayer.

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:41.780
And they say, you're God, and you're the creator.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.179
Notice in verse 31,

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:45.460
and when they had prayed,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.580
you know what's interesting,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.539
what they prayed was that God would give them boldness.

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:52.820
Singularly, that is their prayer request

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.179
in this text of scripture.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:55.979
They did not pray for deliverance,

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:58.460
that God would judge the religious leaders,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.539
that God would, no,

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:00.380
they just.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.380
simply prayed for boldness.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.820
In the midst of this threat, we've heard what's been said,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.920
God, would you grant us boldness?

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.480
What a great prayer request.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.860
And it says in verse 31,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.960
and when they had prayed, the place was shaken

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.360
where they were assembled together

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.160
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.160
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.500
God answered prayer, why?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.840
Because we have a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.040
We have a God who at any time,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.340
we can go before that throne and we have that access

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.840
and we can seek his face.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.380
In the early church, they're facing a situation,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.380
they're facing some opposition

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.020
and we find that they go to God and God answers.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.360
We notice in Acts chapter number six,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.560
notice what's happening in Acts six,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.460
contextually, just very quickly,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.400
the threat from without the, if you will,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.600
the persecution from without is recorded

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.700
in Acts four and five and now all of a sudden

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.340
in chapter number six, there becomes some stirring within.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.900
The enemy is trying to attack from without

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.340
but the enemy is attacking from within.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.880
And we see that in Acts chapter number six.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000
And so what do they do in Acts six?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.840
Well, they pray.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.020
Because the early church was a praying church.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.220
And what did the church do?

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.180
Well, when they had a difficulty, they prayed.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.820
When they had something that they're dealing with,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.320
they prayed, notice in Acts six and verse number four,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.180
this is what the disciples, the apostles say,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.920
Peter here and he says,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.260
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.320
and to the ministry of the word.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.860
If you skip down to verse number six,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.060
it says whom they set before the apostles

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.940
and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.640
This is really the deacons that we read of here

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.140
in Acts chapter number six that are appointed

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.500
over these matters that are being dealt with.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.460
And we find the central focus of prayer

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.540
in Acts chapter nine after the conversion of Saul.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.860
At that time, his name is Saul.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.440
Of course, we know him and it often referred to him

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.880
as Paul, the apostle, the apostle to the Gentiles

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.500
and what a great man of God.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.840
But in Acts chapter nine, he's persecuting

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.779
and he's got authority, but he meets Jesus, hallelujah.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.980
And he gets saved, he gets born again.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.440
And we find that as he gets saved and he says,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.440
Lord, who art thou?

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:33.220
He says, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.520
And God's gonna use a man.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.419
The man that he's gonna use is Ananias.

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:41.160
And Ananias, of course, we're not gonna deal

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.320
with the entire text, but Ananias has some concern

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.500
because he's heard about this man, Saul

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.500
and he has a testimony that goes before him,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.160
this reputation, if you will.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.720
But notice what God says in Acts chapter nine

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.419
in verse number 11, as the Lord answers Ananias,

00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:58.860
the Bible says, arise and go into the street

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.400
which is called Strait and inquire in the house of Judas

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.559
for one called Saul of Tarsus,

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:07.800
notice, for behold, he prayeth.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.980
Saul's saved for just, I mean, just a short period of time

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.840
at this particular time in history.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.680
And what's he doing?

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.980
He's praying, he's praying.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.340
And in Acts chapter number 12, excuse me, Acts chapter 13,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.779
we're gonna deal with Acts 12 as our text this morning,

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.740
but notice in Acts chapter 13,

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.440
this is the first missionary journey.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.279
The church at Antioch, they're gonna send forth

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.320
the first missionaries and we find that in verse number three

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.260
of Acts 13, the Bible says, and when they had fasted

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.600
and prayed and laid their hands on them,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.960
they sent them away.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.160
By the way, I believe that throughout the duration

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.919
of this missionary journey that the church was praying

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:52.960
for the missionaries because at the end of Acts 14,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.260
when they receive word that the missionaries are returning

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.860
to deliver a report, the church shows up

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.760
and the church is there and they get to hear what God did.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.660
I believe this, that they get to hear

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.100
how God answered their prayers,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.040
how God used Paul and Silas on this, Barnabas, excuse me,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.880
on this missionary journey and how God worked

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.080
and they have the opportunity to hear

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.300
in Acts chapter 14 and verse 23,

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.779
before they return to the church at Antioch,

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:23.380
these missionaries, they go back to the churches

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.679
that were established, four of them established

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.480
on this first missionary journey.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.020
In Acts 14 and verse 23, it says,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.720
and when they had ordained them elders in every church

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.399
and had prayed with fasting, they commended them

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:41.000
to the Lord on whom they believed.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.160
In Acts chapter 16, we find that the Bible,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.600
as they arrive in Philippi, now again,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.700
as they receive the direction of the Lord

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.760
to go into Macedonia and during

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.540
this second missionary journey,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.540
the Bible tells us here in Acts chapter 16 and verse 16,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.779
and it came to pass as we went to prayer.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.320
It's a central part of the local church.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.580
It's a central part of the first century church.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.119
In Acts chapter 20 and verse number 36,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.980
notice what the Bible says.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.619
As Paul is going to depart, he's called folks together

00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:16.779
so he could deliver them a message.

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:19.660
He called for the leaders of the church at Ephesus here

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.660
in this particular text, and we find

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.800
that as he gives them instruction

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.220
and gives them a charge in verse 36, it says,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.959
and when he had thus spoken,

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:32.200
he kneeled down and prayed with them all.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.399
And they wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him.

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.559
Could you imagine the scene here

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:41.980
as they had this prayer meeting before Paul would head?

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.820
Where's he going?

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.320
Well, he's heading to Jerusalem.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.839
That's why he called for the leaders

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.959
of the church at Ephesus to meet him there,

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.320
and he's on his way to Jerusalem,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.000
and we find that they have this prayer meeting.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.360
In chapter 21 and verse number five,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.160
the Bible says, and when he had accomplished those days,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.600
we departed and went our way,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.880
and they all brought us on our way with wives and children

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.320
till we were out of the city, and what did they do?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.559
Before they left, it says,

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:10.559
and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed and prayed.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
We could look at more examples this morning,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.239
but I hope at this point,

00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:17.619
after reading this number of verses,

00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:19.200
that you would agree with me

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.880
that the early church was a praying church,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.200
that you would agree this morning

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.020
that the early church believed in,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.279
but also practiced prayer.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.880
You know, a lot of people can believe in things,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.559
but never actually do it.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.920
We believe in the power of prayer,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.800
but how often do we pray?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.160
How often do we pray?

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.959
Do we only pray when there's an urgent matter,

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.640
or are we people of prayer?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.720
The Bible says that we're to pray always.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.959
Pray without ceasing, in 1 Thessalonians.

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:55.320
Be dealing with that this Wednesday evening, actually.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.440
Begin to look at this early church

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.399
and understand the fact that they believed in

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.040
and practiced, they believed in prayer,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.239
individually and corporately.

00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:07.360
You know, it's a blessing to be able

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.080
to go to God on your own.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.399
There's one God and one mediator between God and man,

00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:13.239
the man Christ Jesus.

00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:15.800
I'm thankful that any time, at any place,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.220
for any reason, I can go to God in prayer, and so can you.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.160
You don't need some intercessor.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.040
You don't need to have some mediator.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.480
No, Jesus Christ is our mediator,

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.640
and we go to the Father through the Son,

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:32.119
and what a blessing to understand that truth.

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:35.679
We find this morning that though we can gather,

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.040
or we can individually go to God in prayer,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.160
we understand the emphasis as we look here

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.619
in the book of Acts, that prayer is not just individual,

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:48.160
but it's corporate, corporate prayer.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.239
Turn over to Acts 12.

00:17:49.239 --> 00:17:50.480
I asked you to begin there,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.559
and we're gonna look at this text of Scripture.

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.160
For some, it's a familiar passage of Scripture.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.080
We're gonna go through this passage of Scripture

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.279
here this morning, verses one through 19,

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:03.480
and I wanna look at a praying church.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.100
In Acts 12, in verse number one,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.940
the Bible says,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.880
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.800
to vex certain of the church,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.679
and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:20.440
And so we see the opposition again.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.739
We see what's taking place,

00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:25.520
and we see the death of James at the hand of Herod.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.360
The Bible tells us in verse number three,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.540
and because he, that's speaking of Herod,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.440
saw that it, what's it?

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.960
Well, the killing of James,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.520
this opposition that he led in this persecution,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.419
this martyrdom, that it pleased the Jews.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.080
The Jews are pleased at what's taking place.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.880
The Bible says in verse number three

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.880
that he proceeded further to take Peter also.

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.119
James has been killed, according to verse number two,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.559
and Herod, he says,

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:59.679
Man, this has pleased these people.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:00.679
So guess what?

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:02.099
I'm gonna take Peter also.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:04.479
Peter's a great leader in the church,

00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:07.039
and so the Bible says that these then,

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.119
at the end of verse number three,

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:12.020
were the days of unleavened bread.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.020
So God gives us insight with regard to the timing,

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.599
with regard to when this happened,

00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:23.960
and it says when he had apprehended him.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.599
And so we find that Peter is apprehended by Herod,

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.080
according to verse number four,

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.520
and Herod puts him into prison.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.119
It says he put him in prison

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:36.960
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.479
to keep him.

00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:41.200
Notice, intending after Easter

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.080
to bring him forth to the people.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.039
When he's gonna bring him forth,

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.280
you know what he's gonna do?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280
He's gonna kill him.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.919
That's what he's gonna do.

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:53.200
Because of what was going on,

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.479
he had killed James,

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:57.840
and the timing wasn't right to kill Peter,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.919
but he saw that it pleased the Jews,

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:00.760
and so he says.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:09.320
So I'm going to apprehend Peter and I'm going to incarcerate Peter so that I can kill Peter.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.200
He delivers him to these soldiers and he's kept in ward.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.200
He's in prison.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.860
But I want you to notice verse number 5.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.800
The Bible says Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.400
of the church unto God for him.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.960
We see in verses 1 through 4, really verses 1 through 5, the situation.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.800
If you're taking notes this morning, notice the situation with me.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.040
And here's what I want you to understand this morning.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.320
The church, the early church, the first century church, they had situations the same way every

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.840
church, every individual has situations.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.140
You're a family, you have situations, you have circumstances, you have difficulties

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.140
that arise.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.680
You're a church family, you have situations, you have things that you deal with.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:21:00.360
As an individual, we have situations, matters, circumstances that we deal with.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.340
And as we look here in Acts chapter number 12, we find that in the first five verses

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.960
that God allows us to have an insight and understanding, if you will, to the situation

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.480
that the church faced.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.120
We mentioned already that in Acts chapter number 4, they were facing a different situation.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.560
The situation was a threat that you no longer can speak in the name of Jesus.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.280
So, at the circumstances that are presented in Acts chapter number 4, what did they do?

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.480
Well, they went to prayer.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.240
And here in Acts chapter number 5, as God reveals to us the situation, we see that it's

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.200
a serious matter.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.080
I want you to think about, we're reading this as historical documentation.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.080
This is an accurate historical account that God has given to us.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.120
But I want you to think about being in this church.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.800
I want you to think about being there and understanding what's taking place.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.600
And I want you to consider with me this morning that you're in a situation and you've seen

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.280
James killed.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.200
And you understand the power and the authority that Herod has, and you see that the Jews

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200
are pleased with it.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.480
And by the way, these are the same Jews that in chapter number 4 were saying, you can't

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.520
speak in his name any longer.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.960
And they're pleased that Herod is now putting them to death.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.080
And Peter, Peter is taken, he's incarcerated.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.360
Peter's a leader of the church.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.680
By the way, the enemy knows how to work.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.240
The enemy knows how to work.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.160
But I'm thankful that the church had been given some instruction, the church understood

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.800
some things, the people, they understand the importance of prayer, they see the circumstances,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.360
they see what's taking place.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.720
And in this situation, I want you to put yourselves there.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.760
I want you to think about being there.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.600
How would you feel?

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.680
What would your response be?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.920
See oftentimes we'll use little catch phrases, if you will, cliches, that prayer should be

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.420
our first response and not our last resort and those types of things.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:12.920
But the reality this morning is that in many of our lives, prayer is not our first response.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.600
And there are many times in our lives that we lean on our own understanding that we try

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:23.120
to figure out how we can change the circumstances, how we can maybe manipulate the circumstances.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.200
How can we get Peter out of here?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.880
And maybe this morning if we're in this situation and collectively this is our church and we're

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.140
dealing with this situation and we have a meeting and we say, okay, we gotta come up

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.140
with a plan.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.320
How are we gonna get our pastor, our leader out of prison?

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320
What are we gonna do?

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800
What are some things that we can do?

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.000
We begin to brainstorm, we begin to come up with ideas and we're gonna have this covert

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.400
operation and someone's...

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.120
Sometimes that's how we think.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.560
Sometimes that's how we behave.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.000
We lean on our own understanding.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760
We're trying to figure things out ourselves.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.640
Listen, we're all guilty of it.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.320
We've all been there.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.640
We've all had situations.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.120
We see the situation of the early church.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.920
We understand in Acts 12 the stakes are high.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.400
Peter is going to be put to death.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.960
Herod is not playing games.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.320
What do we do?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.600
How do we respond?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.400
I'm thankful for the privilege of prayer.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:35.119
I'm thankful for a praying church because we see the situation but then we see the supplication

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.760
and really begins in verse number five and as we go through the text of Scripture, notice

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.559
the Bible says, therefore, Peter therefore was kept in prison.

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:50.440
But I want you to notice what the Bible says, but prayer was made notice without ceasing

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.680
of the church unto God for him.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.839
You know how the church, the early church, the first century church, you know how they

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:00.839
respond to the situation?

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:01.839
They prayed.

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:04.720
They said, we gotta have a prayer meeting.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.200
We gotta have a prayer meeting.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.720
This is urgent.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.040
By the way, I think a lot of people showed up for the prayer meeting.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.720
They believed in prayer.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.040
You know, that's fine that you're going to gather over there, but I'm just going to pray

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040
at home.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.360
No, there's something about corporate prayer.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.800
They got together and they prayed.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:30.200
We see in verse number six, this is when Herod would have brought him forth, Peter, what's

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.119
he bringing him forth for?

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:33.119
What's the purpose?

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:34.119
Well, to kill him.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.720
And the Bible says the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.000
By the way, what a great picture of the peace of God.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.180
Amen?

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.839
God tells us about a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:52.520
Jesus said, my peace I give unto thee, not as the world giveth give I unto thee.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.320
He said, my peace, I think about the peace of God.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.119
And Peter, he saw that James was killed.

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:02.220
He knew what Herod's purpose and intentions were.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.080
And we find that Peter is asleep between a couple of soldiers.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.040
The peace of God.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040
The peace of God.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:17.640
Listen, I don't know what you're dealing with this morning, but I know the peace of God.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.680
Peace does not mean the absence of trouble.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.000
See, there's a lot of people that think that they could just have peace if all of their

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.680
troubles would go away.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.920
Peace is not found in the absence of trouble.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.880
Peace is found in the person of Jesus Christ.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.279
He is our peace.

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.640
And the Bible tells us, commands us in the book of Colossians that we're to let the peace

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.440
of God rule in our hearts.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.680
You know what that means?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.040
That's an action we have to take.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040
Why?

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.080
Because sometimes we're dealing with situations where chaos wants to rule in your heart.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.000
Where doubt wants to rule in your heart.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.200
God says let the peace of God rule in your heart.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.119
Wow, hallelujah, for the peace of God.

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:06.119
He's sleeping.

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:11.660
And the Bible says in verse number 6 that He's bound with two chains in the keepers

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.320
before the door kept the prison.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.760
And so again in your mind's eye if you can see the situation we're told of four soldiers

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.920
in verse number 4 and what's happening is Peter is in this cell and he's got two soldiers

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.520
that are chained to him and then there are two soldiers that are watching guard at the

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.559
door.

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:29.279
You think Herod was serious?

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:33.279
You think he wanted to make sure he was going to be able to fulfill his desire in killing

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.279
Peter?

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.279
Absolutely.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.680
He puts everything in place that he could.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.580
By the way it reminds me of what happened a little while earlier with the Lord Jesus

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:47.320
Christ and they came to Pilate and they said, they called our Savior a deceiver and how

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.740
terrible that is.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.200
But they say we know what this deceiver said before he died.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200
He said that he was going to rise again and so we want you to set a watch and make it

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200
sure.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.279
And Pilate said you have it, set it as sure as you can and they did everything they could.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.279
But guess what?

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.800
The stone rolled away.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.960
Hallelujah.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.520
The grave it could not keep him.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.260
They did everything they could.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.800
But Christ rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.160
And here Herod he makes every preparation possible to keep Peter secure within this

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.920
particular prison cell and we find that he's got two soldiers that are chained to him.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.520
He's got two soldiers that are outside of the cell door and the Bible says in verse

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:34.640
7, and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and light shined in the prison and he

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.200
smote Peter on the side.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.600
I like it when it says that.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.799
You ever have to smite someone to wake them up?

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:41.799
Amen?

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:42.799
I remember Elijah, he's here this morning.

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.880
We were at camp several years ago.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.320
You guys were just junior campers and his cousin went with us and his cousin wouldn't

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.479
get up one morning and he said I got it and he went in there and he just smacked that

00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:55.200
young man and woke him up.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200
Got him out of bed.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200
Amen?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.239
And I wasn't going to get away with that but Elijah took care of it and that young man

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:01.239
got up out of bed.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.239
Amen?

00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:06.640
And the Bible says here that he smote Peter on the side and raised him up saying arise

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.000
up quickly.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.600
Notice the Bible says that his chains fell off from his hands.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.720
And the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.040
And he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.320
And he went out and he followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.520
angel but thought he saw a vision.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.040
You ever dream at night and your dream might be so vivid that you think it's real?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.239
I mean Peter's in a position here where he almost thinks he's dreaming, he's having a

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:43.840
vision.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.400
And I want you to see that in verse number 10 it says and when they were past the first

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.400
and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city, notice what

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.080
it says, which opened to them of his own accord.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.799
They went out and passed on through one street.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:05.239
forthwith the angel departed from him." You say, that's just not possible. You don't know

00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:11.119
the God that I know. He's the God of the impossible. He's the God of the impossible. He said, nothing

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:17.719
is too hard for me. How did the gate open? God opened the gate. That's what God can do.

00:30:17.719 --> 00:30:24.439
I want you to understand why all of this is taking place. The church is praying. The church

00:30:24.439 --> 00:30:30.079
is praying. They're in a prayer meeting. They don't know at this moment as we're reading

00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:34.319
the text of Scripture, they don't know what's happening in the prison cell. They don't know

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:39.079
that Peter was asleep between two prison guards and that the angel of the Lord came and smote

00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:45.079
him and the chains fell off and he's walking. They don't know that. They're praying. They're

00:30:45.079 --> 00:30:51.399
praying. I don't know exactly what they're praying. All of us can use our sanctified

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:54.959
imaginations and we can be creative to think of different things that they might have been

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:59.719
praying. But I'm not sure that any of them prayed that God would you just smite them

00:30:59.719 --> 00:31:04.479
and cause those chains to fall off and just open the gates and let them. I don't know

00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:09.319
that they prayed exactly that way. But that's why we take and cherish the prayer promise

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:14.719
that God gives us in Ephesians 3.20, now unto him that is able to exceeding abundantly above

00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:21.479
all that we ask or think. I don't know if I were, now that we have the record of Acts

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:27.359
12, we may pray this way. But without the record of Acts 12, we may not pray in that

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:32.959
same regard, but we have a God who's able to do exceeding abundantly above. And we find

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:38.559
that as the church is having this prayer meeting and we see that God is working again, they

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:43.439
do not even know what God is doing and how God has answered their prayer. We find in

00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:48.519
verse number 11 that when Peter was come to himself, now think about that. He's been smitten

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:52.999
by the angel of the Lord to wake up and to get out of that prison. He goes out and I

00:31:52.999 --> 00:31:57.159
mean the doors open and the gate opens and the Bible says in verse number 12, when he

00:31:57.159 --> 00:32:04.159
came to himself. No, this isn't a vision. No, this isn't a dream. No, this is reality.

00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:12.999
I'm delivered. I'm not in that cell anymore. Man, hallelujah. The Bible says in verse 12,

00:32:13.879 --> 00:32:20.879
here's what he said. Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:28.599
delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of

00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:35.599
the Jews. He says this in verse 12, and when he had considered the thing, he came to the

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:42.759
house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark. Now notice this, where many were

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:50.079
gathered together praying. The Bible told us in verse number 5, but prayer was made

00:32:51.159 --> 00:32:56.079
without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And the Bible tells us that after God

00:32:56.079 --> 00:33:01.959
heard their prayer, after God was working miraculously, after he's answered their prayer

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:08.039
and he's delivered Peter in such a miraculous way as we've read the text of Scripture, that

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:12.199
Peter considers the thing and he says, I'm going to go over here to this particular house

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:17.399
and he goes, and the Bible tells us that there are many that are there praying. They're

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:22.999
gathered together and they're praying. It's an all-night prayer meeting. An all-night

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:28.759
prayer meeting. What a blessing. You know, there was a time in our nation's history that

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:34.719
our churches had all-night prayer meetings. There are some that still do today, and I'm

00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:41.719
thankful for that. An all-night prayer meeting. By the way, I don't think it's a prayer meeting

00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:49.199
is a bad idea. We need prayer. We need to be a praying church. We have a one-hour prayer

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:55.359
meeting on Wednesday evening. And I don't mean to insult anyone, but I said this a few

00:33:55.359 --> 00:34:02.359
weeks ago, you have a one-hour prayer meeting and half the people show up. Our actions speak

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:09.679
louder than our words. What do we believe about prayer? We're a praying church. We

00:34:12.319 --> 00:34:15.959
go to a conference every year in July. We're just at a retreat for a pastor retreat. We

00:34:15.959 --> 00:34:21.799
go to a pastor's conference. Completely different. I mean, as far from one end of the spectrum

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:26.239
to the other are these two meetings that we go to. But this meeting that we go to in July,

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:31.079
it's a pastor's conference. Super, super busy schedule. Lots of preaching and all sorts

00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:36.239
of instructional classes and different things that we go to. And it's an exciting time.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.959
But that church up there, it's where Breonna's going to college right now. That church up

00:34:39.959 --> 00:34:46.720
there in preparation for that pastor's conference, they have an all-night prayer meeting. Leading

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.319
up to that all-night prayer meeting, they have a 24-hour prayer thing that's going on

00:34:52.319 --> 00:34:56.479
where they're not gathered at the local church, but they have people that sign up for certain

00:34:56.479 --> 00:35:01.399
times of the day and they're praying. They have time slots. I'm going to pray from 2

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:06.639
to 3 a.m. I'm going to pray from 7 to 8 p.m., whatever the times are. And they have that

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:11.479
set up. And then they finish that week of those prayer meetings and people praying individually

00:35:11.479 --> 00:35:18.519
at certain times and they come together and they have an all-night church prayer meeting.

00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:25.399
God hears and answers prayer. Prayer is a unique privilege as a child of God. I fear

00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:32.559
this morning that prayer is neglected in our society today. It's probably 25 years ago

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:38.720
now. It was actually 26 years ago now. I've told this story before, but 26 years ago my

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.720
dad was doing a men's prayer breakfast and he was teaching at that men's prayer breakfast.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.720
He was teaching on prayer and he went to a Bible bookstore. He'd only been saved for

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.720
a short time. He was going to a Bible bookstore to try to pick up a book on prayer in order

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.319
to be able to use some things and teach on the subject of prayer. And as he was looking

00:35:57.319 --> 00:36:02.279
in that Christian bookstore, he found a book that was titled, How to Pray, in nine minutes

00:36:02.279 --> 00:36:11.159
and 59 seconds. And really what was communicated even through the title of that book was really

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:16.440
indicative of the society, the culture that we live in. We want everything to be right

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:28.559
now. Prayer is work. Prayer is labor. How many of you know the song, Sweet Hour of Prayer?

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:36.759
Sweet Hour of Prayer. I've said this before as well. Unfortunately in the 21st century,

00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:42.679
it's as if we've exchanged a sweet hour of prayer for just a little talk with Jesus.

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:49.279
And that's another song that you may be familiar with. Sweet Hour of Prayer. Sweet Hour of

00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:55.720
Prayer. It's interesting to me in Acts chapter number 12 that Peter is in prison. The church

00:36:55.759 --> 00:37:02.440
is assembled, as the Bible tells us here, at the house of Mary, the mother of John.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.359
And they're assembled there and praying. And Peter's in prison. They don't know what's

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:10.440
going on with Peter. And Peter doesn't know all that's going on there. But he comes to

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.119
the house. And in verse number 13, the Bible says, As Peter knocked at the door of the

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:21.559
gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And so Peter is there knocking at the door

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:26.559
of the gate. And Rhoda comes to answer, I don't know the time. We find that as you

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:32.399
look throughout the text of Scripture, that the Bible would tell us that Peter is there.

00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:37.639
He's sleeping. He's in between those soldiers and all that's taking place. And we find that

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:42.839
he's knocking at the door. And in verse number 14, it says, And when she knew Peter's voice,

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:46.759
how many of you ever had somebody knock at your door, especially at an unexpected time,

00:37:46.759 --> 00:37:50.319
an unexpected hour, you're not expecting someone, someone knocks and you might say something

00:37:50.319 --> 00:37:54.679
like this. We have rings today. I get it. But maybe, if you can think back a few years,

00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:59.919
you say, who's there? Any of you remember that? One day I'll be preaching in 25 years

00:37:59.919 --> 00:38:03.839
and I'll use something like that. And young people are going to look at me like, why would

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:08.199
you say who's there? Just take out your phone and look at your da-da-da-da, right? I mean,

00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:14.000
you understand what I'm saying? But many of us still today, we can recall saying, who's

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.559
there? The Bible says that when she knew Peter's voice. You ever been in a situation

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:27.720
where you can know who the person is just by hearing their voice? You know their voice.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.399
You're familiar with their voice. And she knew the voice and notice what the Bible says.

00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:38.119
She opened not the gate for gladness. That always makes me laugh when I read verse 14.

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:43.959
But it says that she ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate. I see this young lady,

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:49.839
this damsel. I don't know her specific age, but she's so filled with excitement. She's

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:56.320
so overjoyed that she doesn't open the door. She goes and runs and tells those that are

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.959
praying. Remember, they were gathered together praying. They weren't sitting around watching

00:39:01.959 --> 00:39:06.039
something. I know they didn't have TV, but they're not sitting around playing games and

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:15.799
doing whatever. No, they're praying. They're praying. And Rhoda says that Peter stood before

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:23.479
the gate. Notice the response. It says in verse 15, and they said unto her, Thou art

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:38.440
mad. Crazy. Crazy. You ever pray and God answers and you just can't maybe believe it?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.919
God likes to answer that way, by the way. Prove His power. They say, Thou art mad. But

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:51.000
notice what it says. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.359
His angel. But Peter continued knocking. Think about the persistence of Peter. He just continued

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:00.839
knocking. I'm not sure how long the conversation took. I'm not sure.

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:05.699
of all the interaction, but the Bible says that he continued knocking there and the Bible

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:14.699
says that when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. They were astonished.

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:20.459
Listen, I understand sometimes today we may act like and we may pretend that we're not

00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:24.139
astonished when God answers prayer because we know that God is able to. Listen, when

00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:31.579
God answers in a great way, you'll be astonished. Your faith will be increased. You will have

00:40:31.579 --> 00:40:37.799
joy. It's not that you were praying with unbelief. It's not that you were praying with doubting.

00:40:37.799 --> 00:40:45.459
You're just astonished to see what God was able to do because God often works in such

00:40:45.459 --> 00:40:52.659
a way that would cause his people to stand in awe of who he is. And that's what I believe

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:59.699
happens here. Notice what happens in verse 17. They were astonished. I'm not sure how,

00:40:59.699 --> 00:41:03.699
what they said, but in verse 17 it says, but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:08.819
their peace. I think there were a lot of questions. There was some, you ever, I mean, what's going,

00:41:08.819 --> 00:41:14.459
Peter, what happened? How did you? I think that's what happens. That's what I would be

00:41:14.459 --> 00:41:20.659
wondering. Peter, what happened? How did you get here? And it says that he was beckoning

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:25.579
unto them to hold their peace. And then notice the Bible says he declared unto them how the

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:30.859
Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, go, show these things unto James

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:34.859
and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place. Obviously there's a, it's

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:38.019
a different James. It's not the James that was killed at the beginning of the text. But

00:41:38.019 --> 00:41:46.939
we find here that, that Peter, the verse 17 is a short verse. But what we read from verse

00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:53.219
six down through verse number 11 is what Peter's rehearsing to them. What God did.

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:58.539
Because it says that he declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

00:41:58.539 --> 00:42:04.619
Isn't it exciting when God answers prayer? In verse 18 it says, now as soon as it was

00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:09.559
day, there was no small stir among the soldiers that was become, what was become of Peter.

00:42:09.559 --> 00:42:20.319
Can you imagine the soldiers when they awakened? I mean, if you were chained to Peter and you

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:28.679
opened your eyes and Peter wasn't there, how would you feel? Knowing that you're going

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:32.999
to have to give an account, by the way. Maybe you'd ask the two guys that were watching

00:42:32.999 --> 00:42:38.199
the door, hey, what happened to Peter? Did you see him leave? What's going on? I mean,

00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:51.119
could there be confusion? A level of concern? Stress? It says, there was no small stir

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:57.919
among the soldiers. Verse 19, and when Herod had sought for him and found him not, he examined

00:42:57.919 --> 00:43:02.959
the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to

00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:08.639
Caesarea and their abode. Why did he command that they be put to death? Because they had

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:14.999
a prisoner that was no longer there. It was a serious consequence. I want you to understand

00:43:14.999 --> 00:43:23.439
this morning that God is able to work in such a way, not only would He cause us to rejoice,

00:43:23.439 --> 00:43:29.559
but the lost people are able to sit there and say, I don't know how this happened. Previously,

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:33.959
if you look in Acts 4 and Acts 5, those that were apprehended, they weren't there. Where

00:43:33.959 --> 00:43:40.559
are they? Well, they're preaching. How'd they get there? God delivered them. This morning,

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:47.879
I said it in the beginning of the message, the 21st century church, we need to stop trying

00:43:47.879 --> 00:43:58.599
to be an entertaining church. We need to be a praying church. A praying church. This morning,

00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:05.359
as we look at the admonition from 1 Timothy chapter 2, and we've studied it the last several

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:10.999
weeks, Paul makes it very clear in the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, I exhort therefore that

00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:17.799
first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:21.999
You skip down to verse 8, it says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:28.959
up holy hands without wrath and doubting. As you study the book of Acts, you say, man,

00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:35.319
how did they accomplish everything that they accomplished? Well, there are several keys

00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:39.199
I believe that God gives us as we study the book of Acts. They were filled with the Spirit

00:44:39.199 --> 00:44:44.799
of God. They believed in imminent return after they saw Him ascend and heard the angel say

00:44:44.799 --> 00:44:51.919
He's coming back. But I want you to understand they were a praying church. And God hears

00:44:51.919 --> 00:45:00.799
and answers prayer. God delights in showing Himself mighty. And we, we need to be a praying

00:45:00.799 --> 00:45:08.959
church, individually and corporately. A praying church. I believe this morning, this book,

00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:15.959
there are many prayer promises that God gives us. Many accounts of God's people praying

00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:21.839
and God answering. What we need, we need to see God work. It is time, the psalmist said,

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:26.399
for thee, O Lord, to work. You know what moves the hand of God? The prayers of His

00:45:26.399 --> 00:45:32.879
people. The prayers of His people. This morning, just like the book of Acts and the first century

00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:38.959
church was a praying church, we today, in 2024, we need to be a praying church. A praying

00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:45.119
church. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:49.399
You for the privilege of being able to have a Bible, to be able to study Thy Word, to

00:45:49.399 --> 00:45:55.159
go through and to see how You worked and what You did. Lord, we stand in awe of reading

00:45:55.159 --> 00:46:01.099
this account in Acts 12. For some this morning, they've heard it before. For others, perhaps,

00:46:01.099 --> 00:46:06.119
this morning is the first time they ever heard this passage of Scripture. They heard about

00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:11.919
the persecution, but they heard, as you think about the situation there that the church

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:18.959
was facing, and they had the opportunity to hear about the supplication, the church praying.

00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:24.519
You working and answering and delivering miraculously. God, how we stand in awe of

00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:33.399
who You are. I pray this morning that we would respond, just as we've been ready to receive.

00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:36.879
God that You would challenge us in our own personal lives, corporately that You would

00:46:36.879 --> 00:46:45.319
challenge us with this area of prayer. That as the early church is characterized as being

00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:50.479
a praying church, the Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton would be characterized as

00:46:50.479 --> 00:46:58.519
being a praying church. God, we believe this morning that You hear and answer prayer. And

00:46:58.519 --> 00:47:05.079
I pray that that belief would be evidenced in our behavior because what we do speaks

00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:13.079
louder than what we say. God, I pray that our families, that their children would see

00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:23.039
their parents' belief in prayer. Prayer is a vital part of our lives. I pray that in

00:47:23.039 --> 00:47:27.719
these moments of invitation, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they do not know

00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:32.679
with 100% confidence that heaven is their home. And I pray that we'd have an opportunity

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:37.039
to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home. God,

00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:43.599
I pray for every child of God. Would You help us to be responsive this morning? We'll give

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.759
You the honor and glory for all that You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would

00:47:46.759 --> 00:47:50.559
You stand with me? At the end of each of our services, we have an invitation where we give

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:51.359
you an opportunity.
