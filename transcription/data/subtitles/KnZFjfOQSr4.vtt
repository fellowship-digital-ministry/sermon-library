WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
number 3 and be looking at verses 7 down through verse number 13

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.840
and Revelation chapter 3 tonight verses 7 through 13. The church in

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.920
Philadelphia

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.880
the sixth church that is addressed here in the book of Revelation was located in

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.760
this city, the city of Philadelphia.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.399
It was located about 38 miles southeast of Sardis and of course that was

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.000
the subject in which we studied a couple of Sunday nights ago

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.200
there in verses 1 through 6 of chapter number 3

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.600
and the name Philadelphia, who knows what it means?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.319
Yeah, city of brotherly love.

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.279
Not shove, if you're there it seems like it's the brother of shove, right? The

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.240
brotherly shove.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.279
But it's the brotherly love and it's the same

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:46.200
as our Philadelphia up in Pennsylvania just a few hours from here

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
and that's what the name means. The city was intended to play an important role

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or part

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.400
in spreading the Greek language culture in manners throughout

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.119
Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey where this church was located.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.319
We mentioned back several weeks ago in chapter number 2 when we looked in the

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.760
church in Smyrna

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.160
we said this of the church in Smyrna that it was known as the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.720
poor rich church. Why did we say that? Well in verse number 9 of Revelation 2

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.480
the Bible says I know thy works in tribulation and poverty

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.080
thy poverty but thou art rich and so we said that the church in Smyrna was known

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.559
as the poor

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:33.800
rich church. From many's perspective they had great poverty, God mentions that in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.360
the letter

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.680
but they were rich and I mentioned this when we studied through that portion of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.440
scripture

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.319
just to understand that we are rich in Christ. Think about the memory verse for

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.480
this month, 2nd Corinthians 8 and verse 9.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.639
He left the throne room of heaven, right? He became poor

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:54.959
so that we might be rich and what a blessing to understand what we have in

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.239
Christ. You know that you have in Christ what money cannot buy.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.279
Amen? And what a blessing.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.879
And we come to this church in Philadelphia in Revelation chapter 3

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.559
and verses 7 through 13

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.199
and we could refer to this church as being the weak

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:15.160
strong church and why would we say that? Well notice in verse 7 it says unto the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.880
angel of the church in Philadelphia write

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.880
these things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.639
he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth. Verse 8, I know thy

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.600
works

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.000
behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it. Notice this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.360
for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.679
my name. It would seem and as you study various portions of

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.960
history that the church was not an extremely large

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.440
church in number but I'm thankful that though they might have little strength

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320
physically or numerically

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.080
that they had the power of God resting upon them as you study through this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.559
portion of scripture

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:03.759
you find that this church like the church in Smyrna in fact the only two

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.320
churches of the seven

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.240
that are addressed here in Revelation we find that there are no corrections that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.360
are given

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.360
to the church in Philadelphia and what a blessing to think about that. We

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320
mentioned as we've studied through these seven churches at this point number six

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.080
but as we've studied on the churches that are being addressed in Revelations

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.119
two and three

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.199
and we find that in these two chapters these churches that are addressed that

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.639
are local churches

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.759
but we find that the Lord Jesus Christ who is the head of the church is writing

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.639
to them

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.559
and really if we could call it an evaluation, an examination

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.639
and we've tried to say this and to be mindful of this truth throughout

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.160
each of the studies here on Sunday nights of these churches they

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.520
each end with the statement he that hath an ear

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.600
let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600
churches plural and the reality is that we need to have

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.160
ears to hear and we need to apply truth in our lives

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.080
and we need to understand this evening that just as these local churches were

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.839
being evaluated by

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.160
the Lord Jesus Christ who is the head of the church that the Lord

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.760
it's still his church and he evaluates and by the way his evaluation is

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.000
correct and there are times in which we looked at some of these and you look at

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.279
Ephesus and say no no we've not left our first love no no

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.079
Jesus Christ said you left your first love

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:34.119
so guess what? It's true. They left their first love.

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.720
His evaluation is true. In fact next week

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.799
actually we have a missionary next week but in two weeks when we look at the church

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:44.559
of the Laodiceans as it's called in verse number 14

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.239
though they had a perspective of their

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:51.359
particular situation they

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:55.440
they were wrong on their perspective. They said

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.040
but then God said. We'll look at that in a couple of weeks and so as we look at this

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.000
church in Philadelphia there's some things that we learned that are

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.200
important for us to

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.040
to consider as we look at this local church but then obviously looking at our

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.000
own lives and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.079
yes we ought to examine and evaluate ourselves personally individually then

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.359
corporately as a church

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:17.200
and understand that the Lord Jesus Christ is evaluating his church.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.959
I wanna have in my life personally and in our church corporately

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.040
I want God's favor upon our lives.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.440
Don't you want God's favor?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.000
In my life personally and in our church corporately

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.239
I want God's blessing. I want God's favor.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.079
I wanna be in a place where God is

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:45.320
pleased with us. That God is pleased to

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.480
add people, to bring people, to know that we will be faithful to

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.119
preach his word and to to carry the truth of the gospel. I want to be a

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.880
church that pleases the Lord.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.359
We find that here the church in Philadelphia if you're taking notes

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.559
number one Christ

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.239
reminds them. Christ reminds them. Don't you notice a few things in verses seven and

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.519
eight that the Lord reminds this church of and by the way

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:13.279
there are times in which we need to be reminded. We're prone to forget.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:18.040
It's not maybe that we've forgotten entirely but we just need to be reminded

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.040
of something brought to the forefront of our attention.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.920
In fact Peter says that he was gonna stir up the people by putting them in

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.079
remembrance. He says

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:29.959
though you know these things I'm gonna stir you up by putting you in

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:31.799
remembrance of these things

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:35.799
and so the Lord reminds the church really of five things in these first

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.279
couple of verses, verse seven and eight. Number one he reminds them, notice, these

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.839
things saith he

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.600
that is holy. He that is holy.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.480
You know what God reminds the church in Philadelphia? He reminds them that he's holy.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.079
Can I tell you this evening we need to be reminded that our God is holy.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:07:00.399
He's holy. I was thanking the Lord this morning. You know the psalmist talks about that

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.359
we're to give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.760
I was thanking God this morning. I was sitting right there early this morning before the

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.320
service. I was thanking God that he's holy.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.000
He says to his people not only in the Old Testament but again in the New Testament

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.679
that we're to be holy.

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:21.160
Why? Because he is holy. I think about Isaiah when he sees the Lord

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.839
high holy and lifted up and he sees in Isaiah chapter number six

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:29.600
and the angels are there, holy, holy, holy. In just a few

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.480
verses of scripture we get into the fourth chapter. You get into the scene room of

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.200
heaven and you see holy,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.600
holy, holy. You know as a church we need to be reminded that our God is holy.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.559
He's holy. He's not becoming holy, he is holy.

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:49.880
We find this evening that he first reminds them that he's holy, second he

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.799
reminds them,

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:55.440
notice it says into the angel of the church in Philadelphia, right, these

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.600
things saith he that is

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.959
holy and that is true. Jesus Christ said

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:07.760
I am the way, the truth, and the life. He has a name, you read Revelation 19, truth,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.160
and

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.359
you begin to think about the fact that he is true. Let God be true and let

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:17.040
every man be a liar, right? Our God cannot lie. Titus chapter number one

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.839
talking about the hope of eternal life that God who cannot lie has promised to

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.119
us. He is true.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.760
He is truth. This evening we must be reminded as the church in Philadelphia

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.239
is reminded that our God is true. Listen, we have so many things that are

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:39.559
bombarding us this evening in the world in which we live. Someone, and not to

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.479
point it out in being a negative way, but someone asked a question about how

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.799
things are in a certain part and they said that AI was providing an answer. How

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:51.760
many of you have gone on Google recently and the first answers are AI generated?

00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:57.960
It's what's happening, right? Do you know that that's not always true? Do you know

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.599
how the algorithms work? I don't know, I'm not real deep into it, but algorithms on

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:07.200
Google searches, etc. work different than what you might think. Have you ever heard

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.159
somebody say, well I saw it on the Internet? You know, I'm amazed. You know it

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:18.000
used to be that if you showed somebody a picture that was evidence of something

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.479
that truly happened, right? It's not true anymore. You know how easy it is to

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:35.320
manipulate pictures today? They advertise, they market phones and one of the points

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.840
of marketing the phone is on the ability to edit a photo immediately. You can see

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.239
a parent throwing a child up in the air and it's only, you know, 14, 18 inches

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:51.359
away and then all of a sudden the picture shows the kid like five feet in the air.

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:58.200
No, no, no, no. That's not true. It didn't happen. But our God is true. Everything that

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.679
you read in this Bible.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:11.079
is true. God has given us a pure, true record and He is truth. You remember Pilate? What

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:18.099
is truth? Truth was standing before him and unfortunately he didn't stick around long

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:24.639
enough to get an answer to the question that he posed. He says to the church, I'm holy,

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:32.519
I'm true. Notice, he reminds them that he is king. He says, he that hath the key of

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:37.959
David. You know, think about the Davidic covenant. You begin to think about the role that Christ

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:42.719
will play as king of kings, lord of lords during the millennial reign. He is the rightful

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:49.319
heir to the throne and he will rule and reign. He is king. He then says this in verse number

00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:54.519
7. Notice, it says, he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:11:00.999
The authority that our God has. You know, he has all authority. He has all power and

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:05.559
all authority. Begin to think about that this evening in these reminders. There's one more

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:09.239
that we'll look at in verse number 8. We begin to think about the authority that our God

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:18.559
has. He says that he openeth and no man shutteth and he shutteth and no man openeth. What a

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:23.599
great way to describe the authority that he has. We come to verse number 8. He says,

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:29.839
I know thy works. Isn't that a phrase that we've read to each of these churches? It reminds

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:34.599
us of the fifth truth that we find in these couple of verses of scripture. What does Christ

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:40.479
remind them of? It reminds them that he's omniscient. I know thy works. You know, he

00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:44.639
knows everything about you. He knows everything about me. He knows everything about us. He

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:48.519
knows why we do the things that we do. He knows the motives and all of it. He knows

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:56.079
your heart. He knows your thoughts. He's omniscient. We begin to think about these truths that

00:11:56.079 --> 00:12:00.879
are given to us in verse 7 and 8 of what Christ reminds this church of that he's holy and

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:04.639
true and that he's king and that he has all authority and that he's omniscient. Listen,

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:11.019
this ought to cause us to rejoice. Why? Because that's my savior. That's the head of the church.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:19.819
When he is all of these things, then he reminds his people, we're not serving some man. We're

00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:27.539
not serving some dead little G-O-D. No, we're serving the living God who is holy and true

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:32.579
and he has all power and authority. He is king and he is omniscient. It ought to cause

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:40.519
us to rejoice because we know who he is. And here, as he begins addressing the church in

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:45.319
Philadelphia, he reminds them of these truths. Listen, there are times in which we go through

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:52.319
life and we face a difficulty. We face some uncertainty and we may be led to think that

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:57.479
God doesn't understand or that God doesn't know or that God doesn't… No, he is very

00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:03.279
aware of what we're dealing with. He has a purpose and he has a plan and we trust him

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:09.839
and we serve him and we find that it's his church. He is the head of the church. He reminds

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:15.000
them. Number two, I would say this tonight in verse number eight, Christ commends them.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.639
He commends them. Notice immediately in verse number eight, he commends them for their work.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:25.159
He says, I know thy works. They were serving the Lord. They were involved in doing what

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:29.359
God had called them to do. They were faithful. We'll look at that in just a moment, but I

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:34.199
want you to notice this in verse number eight. He says, I know thy works. Behold, notice

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:41.919
I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it. I want you to think about

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:45.879
that just for a moment. It's a little bit different than what he said in verse seven.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:49.159
In speaking of the authority in verse seven, he says, he that openeth and no man shutteth

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:54.519
and shutteth and no man openeth. And that's a general truth, a statement that is given.

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:59.000
But in verse number eight, while speaking to this church in Philadelphia, he says, I

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it. You think about an open door.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:12.639
You think about the picture Paul talks about that there's an open door, but there are many

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:17.000
adversaries, right? But you begin to think about this open door. If I could use a phrase

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.519
this evening to help us kind of maybe understand it, it's an opportunity. The open door is

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:28.959
an opportunity. And the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who reminds them of who he is and

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:34.959
he reveals all this truth and exposes them to then this truth as he commends them, that

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:41.399
I've given to you an opportunity. Can I say to you this evening that God has given to

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:48.399
his church an opportunity. Can I tell you this evening that we don't serve the Lord,

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:54.919
we don't do what we do because we have a United States Constitution or a Bill of Rights or

00:14:54.919 --> 00:15:01.919
– no, no, we do what we do because we have a Bible and we serve the Lord that's omnipotent,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.559
that has given to us an open door. Listen, I'm thankful for the freedoms and the liberties

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:13.279
and the rights that we have in America, but can I tell you that if those rights are removed,

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:20.279
if those rights do not exist, the truth of this book stands. There are believers, there

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.699
are folks on that missions map that we send dollars to and we pray for that are in places

00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:33.699
around the world that do not have the freedoms and liberties that we do. Yet God says I have

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.440
given you an opportunity. I've opened a door that no man can shut. You know what's interesting

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:49.359
about opportunities? They don't last forever. What's interesting about opportunities? Many

00:15:49.359 --> 00:15:56.359
times it's easier to see them on the other side after we've missed them. You say, man,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.720
I missed an opportunity. God's given to us as a local church, Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.000
he's given to us an opportunity, an open door, an opportunity to reach a region. I've

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.799
often said as people have asked me, and in fact I was sharing with somebody this afternoon

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:16.759
after the service about some ministry things in Northern Virginia and folks that have never

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:21.479
ministered here don't fully comprehend what this region is like, but I've often said this,

00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:28.479
you know, the reality is that God has put the world in our backyard. Literally. We have

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:34.880
the opportunity to reach people in this region of the world that can go back to whatever

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:40.519
country it is and go as missionaries and they know languages and cultures and it's absolutely

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:46.320
amazing the opportunities that God has given to us. We better seize the opportunities.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.820
We better take advantage of the time that God has given to us and Christ commends them

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.839
for their works and he reminds them that he's opened a door for them. He has given to them

00:16:56.839 --> 00:17:02.359
an opportunity. I find that he also commends them for their faithfulness and for their

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:06.039
obedience. Notice it says in verse number 8, the end of the verse,

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:13.039
For thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.880
Again in verse number 10, this is because thou hast kept the word of my patience. Begin

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.359
to think about the faithfulness and the obedience of this church and it is referenced that thou

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:30.359
hast kept my word. Listen, God requires in us to be faithful. To be faithful.

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:40.039
To be obedient. Trust and obey. We sing the song. And I'm thankful this evening, moreover

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:48.039
it's required in Stuart's that a man be found faithful. God has entrusted to us and then

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:55.399
he expects of us faithfulness. How many of you this evening, don't raise your hand, but

00:17:55.399 --> 00:18:02.399
how many of you this evening are thankful that God is faithful? God is faithful. Amen?

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:11.759
And I'm thankful this evening that his faithfulness doesn't vary based on my faithfulness. He's

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:19.799
faithful. But the reality is that we ought to desire to be faithful. To be faithful.

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:25.919
Great is thy faithfulness. We sing the song. It's a favorite of many. Faithful is he that

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:32.919
calleth you who also will do it. 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 24. God is faithful. And then

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:39.320
he expects of us that we too would be faithful. Notice he commends them for their testimony.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:46.320
It says at the end of verse number 8, And hast not denied my name. You know, our testimony

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:54.119
matters. Our testimony matters. There are times in which we're pressed. There are times

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:59.599
in which we're faced with difficulties and maybe we're surrounded by a number. We feel

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:06.599
like we're in the minority and I mean maybe like all alone. Maybe we sometimes have the

00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:13.039
Elijah syndrome. Everyone else has bowed but not me and God of course says no, no, no Elijah

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:19.239
you're not accurate on that. But there are times when we feel that way. But here he says

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:26.239
thou hast not denied my name. They had a good testimony. This evening our testimony matters.

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:33.279
It really does. A good name is rather to be chosen. Right? Great riches. Think about the

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.960
testimony this evening. How's our testimony? You know the testimony of a church? The testimony

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.080
of individuals that are within the church? I don't ever want to be in a position where

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.359
someone's like, oh you go to that church? But you know there have been times that I've heard

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:57.359
that kind of statement. Why? Because all of a sudden that church has a bad testimony in

00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:59.760
a community. I'd have read a church.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.200
church in another state that's looking for a pastor. In fact, there are churches all

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.080
over looking for pastors. It's a sad, sad day in our churches. It really is all over

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.640
the place. I hear about them all the time. A church in another state, the person that

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.240
was telling me about it said, you know, it's going to be a really difficult thing. And

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.200
I said, you know, explain that to me. What do you mean it's going to be a difficult thing?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.160
Well, the pastor's in jail for murder. And so the church has a really bad testimony.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:34.240
And I thought, I guess it does. Like, you got to be kidding me. And they asked me,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.900
what would you do? I have no idea. Like, close it down, change the name, do something, right?

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:48.000
Because the testimony of that church in that community is tarnished. It's tarnished. He

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.480
says, thou hast kept, thou hast not, excuse me, denied my name. Thou hast kept my word

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.760
and hast not denied my name. And number three, Christ comforts them. In verses 9-12, we find

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.920
not only these reminders and the way that Christ commends them, but now He comforts

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.080
them. By the way, aren't you thankful that our God is the God of all comfort? He comforted

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.200
us in all of our tribulation. We read that. The Holy Spirit, one of the names ascribed

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.320
to the Holy Spirit is Comforter. And we find that Christ begins to comfort them. Notice

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.260
in verse number 9, behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.840
are Jews and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.560
thy feet and to know that I have loved thee. Aren't you thankful that God loves us? I'm

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.480
thankful for the security, for the comfort that He gives. We could say in verse number

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.840
9 that victory is certain. Listen, there were some difficulties that they were dealing with,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.320
with this group of people that is mentioned, and we find that God is going to work on the

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.960
behalf. He's going to deal with it, and He says that they're going to know that I have

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.480
loved thee. Victory is certain. Listen, we're on the winning side. Heaven, I preached about

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.160
heaven this morning. I mean, we're going to heaven. We are victorious. We are more than

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.400
conquerors through Christ. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.880
Lord Jesus Christ, and this evening we are on the winning side. Victory is certain. We

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.280
find that in verse number 10 there's this comfort of deliverance in the hour of temptation.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.600
Listen, verse 10, because thou has kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.120
from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:38.120
upon the earth. By the way, a great truth with regard to dealing with the pre-tribulational

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.360
rapture, the fact that you look at what's going to happen as you enter into chapter

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.120
6 and all of the situation with the tribulation and so on and so forth, and we find that He

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.320
speaks about deliverance from what? From the hour of temptation which shall come upon

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.560
all the world for what purpose? To try them that dwell upon the earth. We begin to think

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.120
about the deliverance. We begin to read in 1 and 2 Thessalonians and comparing Scripture

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.260
with Scripture, and we'll get to it in greater detail as we get into chapter 4 and then again

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.400
into chapter number 6. We begin to look at all of these wonderful truths and look at

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.360
the promises that God has given to us, this truth of deliverance. The rewards that are

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.840
mentioned in verse number 11, behold I come quickly, hold that fast which thou hast that

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:34.160
no man take thy crown. We find that the Scriptures teach us about rewards. In fact, we read of

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.040
them in the fourth chapter and how we will take and we will cast those crowns before

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:49.000
the throne and what we will say, thou art worthy O Lord. We find that the truth of eternity

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.560
is at stake or in clear view in verse number 12, him that overcometh will I make a pillar

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.600
in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.460
of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:12.260
of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name. He talks about what he's

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:19.220
going to do for them, these comforts that God is giving to these individual believers

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:25.180
that make up this church in Philadelphia. This evening, I'm thankful for the promises

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:31.860
that God has given to us and the promises bring comfort. The revelation that God has

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.180
given to us enables us to be comforted. We think about what he says to the church in

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.059
Smyrna in chapter 2 in verse number 10, be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:48.339
a crown of life. I think about Paul as he writes in 2 Timothy chapter 4 knowing that

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:55.140
his day of departure is at hand but he recognizes that there's a crown of righteousness that

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.580
the Lord, the faithful judge is going to give him but not only him, he says all of those

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:06.339
that love is appearing and these are comforting truths. We find that a church that's here

00:25:06.339 --> 00:25:13.020
in Philadelphia, this church is given these reminders and then it's commended and then

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.300
God gives them these words of comfort. By the way, I'm thankful for what we read at

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:25.619
the end of the passage of scripture in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and comfort one another with these

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:32.779
words. You know God's words bring comfort. They really do. God brings comfort. He is

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:38.900
the comforter. We find that his word brings comfort. Then I want you to notice finally

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:46.660
this evening number 4, Christ counsels them. He counsels them. We think about counsel.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.420
Counsel is good. I mentioned this last week or two weeks ago when we looked at, I don't

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.540
remember did I preach it last week or the week before, I guess it was two weeks ago

00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:01.059
and we noted the counsel there for the church in Sardis and by the way it was harsh counsel

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:08.700
that was given but I said this that counsel is given and counsel is productive and it's

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:14.700
profitable so long as we take heed to it. There have been plenty of times in your life

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.740
and I know plenty of times in my life that I've given counsel to someone and they let

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.339
it go in one ear and out the other and there are times that I'm guilty of doing the same

00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:30.100
thing when counsel is given. But God here gives counsel to the church and I believe

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:37.100
that it's important for us also to note this counsel and to take heed to the counsel. First

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:43.180
we find that he counsels them with regard to his return. In verse number 11 he says,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:49.900
behold I come quickly. You know that ought to give us some instruction. It ought to give

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:56.779
us some consideration this evening with regard to how we live our lives, what we're doing

00:26:56.779 --> 00:27:02.940
and how we're redeeming the time that God has given to us. Of course no man knoweth

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.580
the hour. We don't know when he's going to return but we find that he says to this church,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.940
I come quickly and we find that as we read the end of the book of Revelation that he

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.660
says he's going to come quickly and we can look and we understand that 2 Peter says that

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:24.900
the scoffers have said where is the time of his appearing? We find that a day is a

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:31.940
thousand years, a thousand years is a day. God's right on time and he's going to come

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:38.580
back. I don't know when but we know that he is. The counsel that he gives to this church

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.779
is to expect his return. And by the way I believe that as you read the book of Acts

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:49.580
I believe that so much happened in the first century through the people of God as the gospel

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:58.700
went forth because they lived expecting his return. It was on their mind. Why? Well because

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.580
the disciples stood there and watched him ascend up into heaven and heard that this

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:09.460
same Jesus shall so come in like manner. Go get busy doing what he told you to do and

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:16.820
here this evening we too have the reminder that Christ is coming back. We find that

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.940
also in verse number 11 we have the responsibility, the counsel is for them to remain steadfast.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:32.940
Hold that fast which thou hast. To remain steadfast. We find that there are many that

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.100
change, many that are trying to find something new, something different, becoming more relevant

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.540
and so on and so forth but the reality is that God says to this church hold that fast

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:50.820
which thou hast. Sometimes a church can try to be so relevant to its community that it

00:28:50.820 --> 00:29:00.540
becomes irrelevant to God. Read in the Old Testament, Ichabod. What's it mean? The glory

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:10.780
of the Lord hath departed. We find this evening that he says hold that fast which thou hast.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:18.460
You know we've been given truth. We find that Paul gives to Timothy, 2 Timothy 2 and verse

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:27.020
number 2 this charge to commit to teach faithful men to teach them what? The things that thou

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:34.299
hast heard of me among many witnesses the same. Commit thou to faithful men who shall

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:40.479
be able to teach others also. We find that we read in the book of Jude just one chapter

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:46.500
in just a really a short letter but we find that the Bible says that it was needful in

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.960
verse number 3 that Jude says it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:58.160
you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.799
I'm so thankful for the purity of

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:06.439
doctrine. I'm thankful for the truth that we have." And he tells the church to remain

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:14.439
steadfast, to hold that fast which thou hast. I'm not looking for any new revelation.

00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:21.919
Canon of Scripture is closed. Amen? We interpret everything through this book. We take heed

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:26.639
to this book. We hold fast to what God has given to us and we faithfully preach. What

00:30:26.639 --> 00:30:33.339
did Paul tell Timothy in 2 Timothy 4? Preach the word. The time is going to come when men

00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:37.539
will not endure sound doctrine, he goes on to say in the same text of Scripture, but

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:45.719
it did not change the charge. The charge is given and then the reality of the people not

00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:54.119
enduring it is given as well, but the charge remains. Remain steadfast. Therefore, my beloved

00:30:54.119 --> 00:31:01.039
brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Why? For

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:08.679
as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians chapter

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:14.999
15 and verse number 58 I believe it is. And what a blessing to think about the charge

00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:22.239
that's been given to us. This counsel. Expect his return. Remain steadfast and then we find

00:31:22.239 --> 00:31:27.079
in verse number 13 this truth that's given to every church that's written to in the book

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:35.799
of Revelation. Listen and take heed. The believers in Philadelphia were doing well. They're doing

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:43.239
well. They're not corrected at all. They're reminded of some things. They're commended.

00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:48.039
They're comforted. They're counseled. And we find that the church in Philadelphia, they're

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:53.599
doing well, but they too could learn and should learn from the letters written to the

00:31:53.599 --> 00:32:02.479
other churches. Much can change in just one generation. Much can change in just one generation.

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:07.839
And it's important for a church that's doing what they're supposed to do to have that listen

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:13.319
and take heed and to be sure that we're going to protect and seek to please and honor our

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:20.519
Lord so that we don't get out of balance one way or the other. And though the church was

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:29.519
doing well, they could not relax. They couldn't just say, you know, we can kind of coast now.

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:34.919
Because we weren't really corrected for anything and so we can just kind of lay back and take

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:48.039
it easy. No. No. They had to hear. I'm thankful that God's given to us counsel, warnings,

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:55.039
instructions. This evening the church in Philadelphia is a good church. This evening the church

00:32:55.039 --> 00:33:00.239
is reminded of some things. I hope that we would take heed, that we too would be reminded

00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:05.079
of what God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the head of the church, says to this church about who

00:33:05.079 --> 00:33:12.919
he is, his person. That we'd be reminded that we serve God of the universe. The one who

00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:16.799
is holy, the one that is true, the one who has all power, that knows all things, he is

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:23.959
king. That's the head of the church. And I'm so thankful for that. This evening he's called

00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:31.879
us to remain faithful. He's called us to do his work, to hold fast, to maintain a testimony

00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:39.479
that's pleasing and honoring to him. He'll comfort us in a time of our difficulty. He

00:33:39.479 --> 00:33:46.519
reminds us of eternity. He reminds us of victory. This evening those are good reminders for

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:55.759
us. Oh, that we would have that desire to be a church that has God's favor, that God's

00:33:55.759 --> 00:34:05.319
hand of blessing is upon us corporately. It only happens if individually we have God's

00:34:05.319 --> 00:34:12.879
hand upon us. Brother Jeff mentioned the verse this morning, talking about a recap from last

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:21.119
week, a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. I went last week to the book of Joshua

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:32.239
in the seventh chapter. There was sin in the camp. It was really just one man, Achan. Because

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:40.639
of sin in the camp, God's hand of blessing was being pulled back. What did God say? Unless

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:46.599
you deal with it, I'm not going to fight for you anymore. You've got to deal with it.

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:51.919
So Joshua made the right choice. He followed the leadership of God. And they dealt with

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:58.440
Achan the troubler of Israel. And then God's hand of favor and blessing was upon them again.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:05.159
Oh, that we would live our lives in such a way that God would be pleased, that God's

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:07.839
favor would be upon us. Let's pray. Father, we love you.
