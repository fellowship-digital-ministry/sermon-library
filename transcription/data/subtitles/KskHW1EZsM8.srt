1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Five, and they left the stool up here.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,760
Joseph, I can be as tall as you, amen?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,679
Praise the Lord, glory.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,140
Could you imagine if I was this tall?

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,439
Man, that's crazy.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,439
And to think about the first time,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,100
the first several times we ever sang as a family,

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,840
Joseph would stand on that stool so that you could see him.

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,719
Honestly, those of you that were here in the beginning,

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,040
that when we got here, he had to stand on that stool

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,799
and you'd be able to see him over the pulpit

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,400
if he stood on the stool.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,959
And now we need to have him get on his knees

14
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,560
and we'd all be around the same height, amen?

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,240
But that's special.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,240
I appreciate that song so very much

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,099
that Brianna and Lydia and Natalie sang.

18
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,119
What a great truth, amen?

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,599
First John chapter number five.

20
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:55,000
First John chapter number five this morning.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,919
And be looking at verses 14 and 15

22
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:59,479
if you did notice on the back of the bulletin this morning,

23
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,520
the title for the message, Confident Prayer.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,879
And I'm so thankful that as we study the book of First John

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,839
and we've been studying this book all year

26
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:09,580
and we've taken several weeks off here and there

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,959
with other messages and what have you

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,760
as the Lord has given leadership.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,400
But as we've studied the book of First John,

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,519
several things have really stood out to us.

31
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,160
Of course, we've used as our theme, walking in the light

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,639
and the desire that we understand that God has for us

33
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:27,040
to have fellowship with him, to abide in him.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,879
And what a joy to know that we are able to have fellowship

35
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,879
with the God of the universe.

36
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,319
That right there just should cause us to rejoice

37
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,139
and to just be so thankful that God Almighty

38
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:42,879
is interested in you as an individual.

39
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,620
He's interested in me as an individual.

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,680
Not only did he save me, but he also allows me

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,639
to have fellowship with him as often as I desire.

42
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,360
That's precious.

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,260
But we know that as we study the book of First John

44
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,379
that we've also understood that there are many things

45
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,199
that God wants us to know.

46
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,559
We find it as we study other portions of scripture

47
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,239
that we find regularly that God will say something like this

48
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,559
I would not have you be ignorant brethren.

49
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,399
God wants his people to be informed.

50
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,399
He wants us to have knowledge.

51
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:17,160
And as we've studied through the book of First John,

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,800
we've made note that this word know or to know

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,559
or knowledge or knowing is a repeated word

54
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,440
throughout the book of First John.

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,039
And God wants us to know some things.

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,679
As we study the fourth chapter,

57
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,440
we found specifically and repeatedly

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,199
that God wants us to know that he loves us.

59
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,039
By the way, aren't you so thankful for the love of God?

60
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,839
We sang this morning in Sunday school,

61
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:45,119
Jesus loves me, this I know.

62
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,479
For the Bible tells me so, amen.

63
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,479
And God wants us to know some things.

64
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,960
He wants us to be informed.

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
He wants us to have that knowledge

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,520
and knowledge gives us confidence.

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,360
And we find that as we look at the passage of scripture

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,279
that is before us this morning in verses 14 and 15,

69
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,960
we find that God wants us to have confidence

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,360
when it comes to this matter of prayer.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,600
And we find that he says this in verse 14,

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
he says, and this is the confidence that we have in him.

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,360
Him is Jesus, the son of God.

75
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,839
The exalted savior, the one who's coming back.

76
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:27,160
And he says that we would have confidence in him

77
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,160
that if we ask anything according to his will,

78
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,119
he heareth us.

79
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,360
And if we know that he hear us,

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,220
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions

81
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,399
that we desired of him.

82
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,000
Confident prayer.

83
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,000
John, the apostle, the disciple,

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,919
he had the privilege of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ

85
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,600
during his earthly ministry.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
He had the privilege of being an eyewitness

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
to several of the miracles.

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,699
And we find that even as John would begin writing

89
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,000
this particular book, he says in verse number two,

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,699
and let me begin in verse number one of chapter one.

91
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,039
He says that which was from the beginning,

92
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,539
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,

93
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,040
which we have looked upon,

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,760
and our hands have handled of the word of life.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,200
John was an eyewitness.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
He says in verse number two,

97
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,260
for the life was manifested and we have seen it.

98
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,100
And what do we do?

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,079
We bear witness and show unto you that eternal life,

100
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,459
which was with the father and was manifested unto us,

101
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,880
that which we have seen and heard,

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,079
declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship

103
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,959
with us and truly our fellowship is with the father

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,959
and with his son, Jesus Christ.

105
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,000
And these things write we unto you,

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
notice what he says, that your joy may be full.

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,799
As you study scripture and you interpret scripture

108
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,980
with scripture, you find that the psalmist says

109
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,000
that in his presence is fullness of joy.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,399
And here the Bible says that ye,

111
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,239
that your joy may be full.

112
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:13,640
And we find that the importance of fellowship

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,279
and understanding that John,

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,480
he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,880
He was really part of that inner circle, if you will.

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
You think about the 12 disciples,

117
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,920
but then you think often where the Bible speaks

118
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,399
about Peter, James, and John.

119
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,899
And the three of them had the opportunity to go in

120
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,459
and see some miracles that others did not have

121
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,399
the privilege of seeing, even some of the disciples

122
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,600
as far as them being performed.

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
We find that Peter, James, and John were the three

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,320
that went with Jesus up on the Mount of Transfiguration.

125
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,640
And we find that John had the privilege

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,279
of walking with Christ.

127
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,640
As he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

128
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,000
not only did he have the privilege of hearing

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,880
the teaching of Jesus, specifically with regard

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,679
to our subject this morning with regard to prayer,

131
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,880
but think about this, John had the privilege

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,559
of observing the prayer life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,720
Not only did John hear the instruction

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,119
that Jesus would give with regard to prayer,

135
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,720
remember what one question that the disciples asked Jesus,

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Lord, teach us, teach us to pray, teach us to pray.

137
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,160
We find that John received that instruction,

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,720
but John also observed the prayer life of Jesus.

139
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,600
And we often understand in John 18, I referenced it

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,440
when we looked at the truth of the Garden of Gethsemane,

141
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,079
when Jesus was in Jerusalem, he oft would go to that place

142
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,959
and that was his prayer closet, if you will,

143
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,040
when he was in Jerusalem.

144
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,799
You find that when he's there around the region of Galilee

145
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,559
that he would enter and he'd go into a mountain somewhere

146
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,579
and he'd pray, and you'd find that Jesus

147
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,700
was giving that great example.

148
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,839
The text that is before us this morning here

149
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,920
in 1 John 5, verses 14 and 15 really mirrors the truth

150
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,519
that John has stated earlier in this book.

151
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,559
In 1 John 3, in verse number 22,

152
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,679
you might look just a page over in your Bible

153
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:16,600
and notice what he says here in 1 John 3, in verse number 22.

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,079
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him.

155
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,660
But then notice what he says,

156
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,600
because we keep his commandments and do those things

157
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,179
that are pleasing in his sight.

158
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,679
We find that as we're abiding in him and we're obeying him,

159
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,920
that it leads to that confident prayer.

160
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,200
And we see also here in 1 John 5

161
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,519
that he begins to deal with the importance

162
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,760
of having confidence in prayer.

163
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Not only did John write that here

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

165
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,000
but I wanna read to you what John would have heard

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the Lord Jesus Christ say before he went

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,559
to the cross of Calvary.

168
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,959
In John chapter number 14,

169
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,519
oftentimes as we think about that portion of scripture

170
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,279
or that chapter in the word of God,

171
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,399
we think about verse number six where Jesus said,

172
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,920
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,600
No man cometh unto me, or no man cometh unto the Father,

174
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
but by me.

175
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,679
And it's a verse of scripture that we've often quoted

176
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,679
and repeated and certainly an important verse of scripture.

177
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,480
But just shortly after that,

178
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,799
Jesus spoke these words in John 14,

179
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,760
in verses 13 and 14, he says,

180
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,200
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name,

181
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,119
that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

182
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:29,519
If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.

183
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,520
Begin to think about the promises that God has given us

184
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,880
with regard to prayer.

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,359
We begin to think about the privilege

186
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,359
that God has given us as the people of God

187
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,159
to enter into his presence,

188
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,299
to understand the privilege of prayer.

189
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,640
This morning as we begin to think about

190
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,659
this confident prayer,

191
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,200
I want you to just notice a few things.

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,599
Notice with me first of all,

193
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,000
and we've used it for the title,

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,960
but also as we begin the message this morning,

195
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,880
notice the confidence we are to have.

196
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,200
In verse number 14 of 1 John chapter number five,

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,380
he says, and this is the confidence that we have in him.

198
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,799
Notice the confidence isn't in you,

199
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,159
the confidence isn't necessarily in the prayer,

200
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,400
meaning some kind of rote religion,

201
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,159
if you could understand what I mean by that.

202
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,679
It's not that somebody has written out some prayers

203
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,719
and we have a prayer book or a prayer journal

204
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,080
and there's some faith in those prayers

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,479
or some confidence in those prayers.

206
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:27,440
No, he says this is the confidence that we have in him,

207
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,219
in the one that we're praying to.

208
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,559
There are times that people say,

209
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,919
well, I just don't know how to pray.

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,280
It doesn't, I'm not sure, I'm not articulate,

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm not really good with my words.

212
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,359
God knows that and God just wants to hear you pray.

213
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:45,119
Our confidence is not in the eloquence of our prayer,

214
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:50,119
our confidence is the one that we're praying to, amen.

215
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,599
There's some times that people will hear somebody pray,

216
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,880
by the way, think about the religious leaders of the day,

217
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,039
they would stand and they would pray,

218
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,960
oh, our God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and so on

219
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,920
so forth, right? And what did Jesus say about those ones that prayed that way that everyone

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,080
would see them? He said, they have their reward. You know what their reward was? Being seen

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:18,520
of men. Somebody saying, oh, did you hear how he prayed? No, no. Our confidence is in

222
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,960
him. And I'm so thankful that access to the throne room of heaven has been provided by

223
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,080
the Lord Jesus Christ and that he desires that his children would pray, not only with

224
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,160
confidence, but with boldness. We think about the truth of Hebrews four in verse number

225
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,120
16, where the Bible says that we're to enter with boldness and think about how we find

226
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
it written here in Hebrews four and verse number 16, again, dealing with the fact that

227
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,180
we have a great high priest, the Lord Jesus Christ that is ever living to make intercession

228
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,020
for us. And he says in Hebrews four in verse number 16, let us therefore come boldly under

229
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:07,260
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need.

230
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,620
We think about that word that he uses in Hebrews four in verse 16, that we would come boldly.

231
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,180
And we think about this truth in verse 14, and this is the confidence. And really it's

232
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,420
interesting, the word translated confidence and the word translated boldly are the same

233
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,980
Greek word. God wants us to have confidence. He wants us to have that boldness as we enter

234
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,620
into his presence. Why? Understanding that he ever lives to make intercession for us,

235
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,300
understanding that there's one God and one mediator between man and God, the man, Christ

236
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:46,820
Jesus. And I'm so thankful that we have direct access to God in prayer. I don't have to wait

237
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,580
for someone else to be able to pray to God for. I don't have to go somewhere else. I

238
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,340
can find any time, any place, anywhere for any reason, I can go to my God in prayer,

239
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:05,380
in confidence. He says, then this is the confidence that we have in him. Paul says it this way

240
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,040
in first Timothy chapter number two, when he talks about, first of all, that prayers

241
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,860
and supplications will be made. He says this, I will therefore that men pray everywhere

242
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,100
lifting up holy hands, and then he says this in verse number eight, without wrath and doubting.

243
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,960
Without wrath and doubting. And so we find that we as the people of God, we are rejoicing

244
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,460
and understanding that we have confidence in him. There are times in which we've had

245
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,220
people that we've placed confidence in. The Bible talks about putting confidence in unfaithful

246
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,700
man. It's like a foot out of joint. It's like a broken tooth. Listen, our God is faithful

247
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,380
and it is never, as we think about in this passage of scripture, when we pray to him

248
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,280
and we look to him and we have confidence in him that he hears us. We had testimony

249
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,500
time on Tuesday evening for prayer, praise, and pie. There were many that were rejoicing

250
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,760
and thanking God for hearing our prayers and for answering prayer. And Brianna made the

251
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,480
statement that we can pray and he can hear all of us at the same time. God's never busy.

252
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,160
It's never a situation where he doesn't hear us when we go to him in prayer, when he has

253
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,720
that ability. You ever been in a situation where two people are talking to you at the

254
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,880
same time? Most people say, hey listen, one at a time. God can hear all of us. And he

255
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,280
knows exactly what we're praying. And we have confidence in him. Think about this truth.

256
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Turn to the book of Matthew, if you will. Look at what Jesus is teaching. This is during

257
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,180
the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, 6, and 7. And I want you to see what Jesus says

258
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:47,640
here with regard to prayer. In Matthew chapter number 7, this ought to encourage you this

259
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:55,120
morning and help us to have confidence. Notice in verse 7 of Matthew 7, Jesus begins and

260
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,160
says this, ask and it shall be given you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall

261
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,840
be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth. And

262
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,520
to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Notice what he says in verse number 9, or what man

263
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:22,400
is there of you whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Isn't that a great

264
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,440
example, analogy? Hey listen, if your son asks you for bread, are you going to give

265
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:37,680
him a stone? Surely not. Notice in verse number 10, or if he ask a fish, will he give

266
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:50,640
him a serpent? If ye then, verse number 11, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto

267
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:00,480
your children. Notice these three words, how much more? How much more shall your Father

268
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,160
which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Isn't that wonderful? He says

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,240
listen, you, I mean compared to God and His holiness, he says you're evil and you know

270
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,020
how to give good gifts. If your son comes and says can I have bread, you're not going

271
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,420
to give him a stone. If he asks for a fish, you're not going to give him a serpent. And

272
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:30,700
so how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask

273
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,820
him? Wow, the confidence that we're to have in knowing that He hears us. How many times,

274
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,780
and we don't have the time this morning to look at the examples, but how many times as

275
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:46,700
we read the word of God do we read where the Bible tells us that God heard their prayers.

276
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,020
In fact, we find right here in this passage of Scripture in 1 John 5, it says that this

277
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,700
is the confidence that we have in Him that if we ask anything according to His will,

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,100
He heareth us. And if we know that He heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have

279
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,100
the petitions that we desired of Him. God wants His children to have confidence when

280
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,580
we pray. I remember as a child, my parents aren't here, they're traveling, I don't think

281
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,820
they're watching live stream this morning, but I don't mind if they are or if you tell

282
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,580
them, it's not a secret. But sometimes children, and I remember being this way, sometimes children

283
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,820
have more confidence asking mom for something than asking dad for something. Any of you

284
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,500
ever had that experience? And I had that experience as a child, I'd go ask my mom for certain

285
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,140
things and she'd say this, ask dad. Like, well, you know, could you do it for me? You

286
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,540
know, that kind of thing, right? And I know even sometimes for my children, they'll ask

287
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,700
Holly something before they might ask me. Brianna's smiling and Joseph is kind of holding

288
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,580
back a smile back there. And I don't know why that is, why that's so standard, just

289
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,820
a typical nature, human nature. But understand this morning that though as humans there are

290
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,620
times that we might not have confidence asking somebody, when we think about the truth of

291
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:14,020
my relationship with the God of the universe, because I've been saved, I'm His child, I'm

292
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:20,020
to have absolute confidence. Notice what he says in chapter number three of this book,

293
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,340
and then we'll get into the next point. In 1 John chapter number three, and I want this

294
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,540
to sink in this morning when we think about this truth of having confidence in prayer,

295
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,480
because really it all is leading up to this passage that we're looking at with this confidence

296
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,420
in prayer. I mentioned about the fourth chapter, knowing that He loves us, but notice what

297
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,100
He says in verse number one of 1 John chapter three.

298
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,740
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, and then notice this, that

299
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:55,100
we should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew

300
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,980
Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

301
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:08,140
but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as

302
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,220
He is. He then talks about purity in the next verse of Scripture and how important that

303
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,380
is, but I want you to understand this morning when we think about this confident prayer

304
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,660
that we understand I'm His child. How did I become His son? By trusting the Lord Jesus

305
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,060
Christ as my personal Savior. This morning if you know that you're a son of His, that

306
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,020
you've trusted, you've placed your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and He

307
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,460
is your Savior, the Bible says that you are His son. You're His child. You're His son

308
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,619
or His daughter. You are His child and you are to have confidence that you can go to

309
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:50,300
Him in prayer. Isn't that awesome? Notice as we continue looking at the passage of Scripture,

310
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,020
we notice that there is a condition stated. Number one, we notice the confidence we are

311
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,540
to have. Number two, we notice the condition that is stated. The Bible says this, and this

312
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,980
is the confidence, verse 14, that we have in Him, that if we ask anything and then notice

313
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:11,700
this phrase, according to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He heareth us, what

314
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,660
shall we ask? We know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. Some people say, well,

315
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,500
I said if you ask, you're going to receive. I asked Him for a million bucks and I'm waiting

316
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,580
for my million dollars. That's not what the Bible teaches. Amen? Now God might bless you

317
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,619
with a million dollars and that's perfectly fine if God would do that because He knows

318
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:34,020
that He can entrust you with that and that you would use it for His honor and for His

319
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,540
glory. But we understand that as we look here at the passage of Scripture that there is

320
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,940
this condition that is stated that He says that it's according to His will. And so the

321
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,260
believer, the child of God, the one that has that relationship with the God of Heaven that

322
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,300
understands that they can come in confidence in Him, come in boldness through the throne

323
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,980
of grace, we are to pray according to His will. So the big question then would be how

324
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,200
How do we know His will?

325
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Through His Word.

326
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
God has revealed to us in His Word, His will.

327
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,440
We find that we have, Paul says in the church in Corinth, we have the mind of Christ.

328
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,760
He says this, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus in Philippians chapter

329
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
number 2.

330
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,320
And we find that we have the very Word of God and as we desire to know the will of God,

331
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,100
as we desire to pray according to the will of God, we dig into the Word of God and we

332
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,880
discover the will of God.

333
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,120
Paul prayed that this thorn in his side would depart from him, but God said my grace is

334
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
sufficient.

335
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,400
So we find that in that passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, that it

336
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,960
was not the will of God to deliver Paul from that thorn in his side.

337
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
Could God have delivered him?

338
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,560
No.

339
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,140
But Paul learned a great lesson in not being delivered by that thorn in his side, but understanding

340
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,080
that God said my grace is sufficient for you.

341
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,880
So we begin to understand how is it that we would pray according to His will.

342
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,820
Well we understand the condition that is stated here in 1 John chapter number 5, but we also

343
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,240
understand this is what Jesus taught.

344
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,720
Go over to the book of Luke if you will, we'll look at a couple of verses of scripture in

345
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,400
the book of Luke, and understand this is what Jesus taught, Luke chapter number 11.

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,320
And understand that here in this passage of scripture is where we find the disciple

347
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,260
that stands up and says, Lord teach us to pray.

348
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,500
It was a certain place that they were, and one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord teach

349
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,640
us to pray.

350
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,980
I'm thankful that this disciple asked the Lord this pertinent, relevant question.

351
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,600
We find that Jesus would give an answer, and He said to them in verse number 2, by the

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,280
way this is not the Lord's prayer, this is a model prayer, and we find that Jesus says

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,160
this in verse number 2, when ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be

354
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Thy name.

355
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,080
You enter into His presence recognizing His holiness.

356
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,500
He is holy, our God is holy, holy, holy, holy.

357
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,600
We enter into His presence.

358
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,360
By the way, because He is holy, He has given us the truth on how we approach Him.

359
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,440
We don't just approach Him any old way we want.

360
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,680
By the way, come back this evening, we'll be looking at Galatians chapter number 3,

361
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,480
and answering a question in the Ask the Pastor series with regard to what meaneth the law.

362
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,800
And really what we learn as we study the Old Testament with regard to our approach to God.

363
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,200
So many people today are throwing the Old Testament out.

364
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,840
It's not relevant, we don't need it.

365
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,800
While God is the same yesterday and today and forever, I'm thankful that I don't have

366
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,840
to follow the law, but the law does teach me some things, amen?

367
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,480
And I'm thankful that Jesus fulfilled the law, glory, hallelujah, amen?

368
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,600
But the reality is we find here that Jesus says, listen, recognize that you're entering

369
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,360
into the presence of a thrice holy God.

370
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,320
He says this, Thy kingdom come, notice this phrase, Thy will be done.

371
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,920
As in heaven, so in earth.

372
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,040
And so Jesus taught that we're to pray according to the will of God.

373
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,840
Not only did Jesus teach that, but Jesus practiced that.

374
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,880
Look over in Luke chapter number 22, if you will, in Luke chapter number 22, and we'll

375
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,000
just look at one of the examples here when He's praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.

376
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,160
The Bible tells us in verse number 39 of Luke chapter number 22, and He came out and went

377
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,800
as He was wont to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples also followed Him, and so we

378
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,040
find that He's there and Jesus is going to pray in the garden.

379
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,040
He says to the disciples in verse number 40, when He was at the place, He said unto them,

380
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,840
pray that ye enter not into temptation.

381
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,880
And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed.

382
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Notice what He prayed.

383
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
He had taught that they're to pray according to His will.

384
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,560
He says, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will,

385
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,760
but thine be done.

386
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,600
By the way, I do not believe that Jesus was praying to not go to the cross.

387
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
That's not what He was praying.

388
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,040
Some people teach that.

389
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,320
I do not believe that for one second.

390
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,600
I believe that all of the forces of hell were trying to kill Jesus in the garden so that

391
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,480
He could never make it to the cross.

392
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,400
Because if He made it to the cross, that was the fulfillment of prophecy and that was what

393
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,360
was required for man to be redeemed.

394
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Amen?

395
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,640
And so we find that as we look here at this truth in Luke chapter number 22 and understand

396
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,600
what He's praying, how would He pray?

397
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,840
Why would He pray that He would not go to the cross?

398
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,480
And Hebrews tells us that for the joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross,

399
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
right?

400
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
What was the joy?

401
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,800
The fact that souls would be saved, lives would be changed.

402
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,240
He said that He came to do the will of His Father.

403
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,840
And He knew that from before the foundation of the world, that it was appointed that He

404
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,480
would be the Lamb that was slain on the cross of Calvary.

405
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,120
That was all for free, not part of the message on prayer.

406
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Amen?

407
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,920
But I do not believe that's what Jesus was praying at all.

408
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,000
He was praying according to the will of God and He knew that He was going to go to the

409
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
cross of Calvary.

410
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,280
And so we know that Jesus taught, Jesus not only taught, but He practiced this truth that

411
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,640
is stated in 1 John 5 and verse number 14, the condition that we pray according to His

412
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
will.

413
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,440
We will not take the time this morning, but if you were to do a Bible study, you would

414
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
find that if you go to the book of 1 Kings and chapter number 18 and then cross-reference

415
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,000
that with James chapter number 5, you will find that Elijah prayed with confidence.

416
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Did he not?

417
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,600
When you think about that showdown at Mount Carmel and all of those Baal worshipers came

418
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,440
and all that was taking place there, and we find that there Elijah prayed with confidence

419
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,240
and with boldness.

420
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,120
Do you think that when Elijah prayed that he expected fire to fall from heaven?

421
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Hallelujah!

422
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,940
I mean, I don't think he had one part of his being that doubted for one nanosecond that

423
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,040
fire was not going to fall from heaven.

424
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Why?

425
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:30,840
Because he said this when he prayed, I have done all of this according to Thy word.

426
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,140
Elijah knew that he was praying according to the will of God.

427
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,920
He was doing everything that he did was according to the will of God.

428
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,240
And the Bible tells us in James chapter number 5 that Elijah is a man just like we're men,

429
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,640
but the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

430
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,640
And Elijah prayed with confidence, he prayed with boldness, he prayed according to the

431
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
will of God.

432
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,600
And so we understand the confidence that we're to have, but we notice that there's a condition

433
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,280
that is stated, and we begin to think about praying according to the will of God.

434
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,960
Listen, as we think about praying according to the will of God, just a few thoughts this

435
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
morning.

436
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,680
Number one, it's God's will for all men to be saved.

437
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,560
I believe that this morning.

438
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,360
The Bible says that the Lord is not slack concerning His promises.

439
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,720
Some men count slackness as He is not, He is long-suffering to us, we're not willing

440
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,680
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

441
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:31,200
The Bible tells us in 1 Timothy chapter number 2 that His will is that all men would be saved.

442
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,840
He says this, the Bible tells us in Romans chapter number 10, for whosoever shall call

443
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,880
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

444
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,680
So I can have confidence as the one giving the instruction when I share the gospel with

445
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,480
someone and they understand that they're a sinner, they understand that they have violated

446
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,160
the law of God and they are guilty, they understand that Jesus fulfilled all that

447
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,880
was necessary for them to be saved, to be born again, and they understand that Jesus

448
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,760
bled and died, He was buried and He rose again, and they place their faith and trust in the

449
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,320
finished work of Christ at Calvary, that when I say to them, whosoever shall call upon the

450
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,200
name of the Lord shall be saved, and I say something like this, how do you call upon

451
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,760
the name of the Lord?

452
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,800
You pray.

453
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,960
And I can tell you that that's a prayer that is according to the will of God.

454
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Amen?

455
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,760
Listen, let me tell you a prayer that's according to the will of God for your spiritual growth.

456
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,960
You pray and ask God to help you grow spiritually, that's a prayer that's according to His will.

457
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
God help me to grow.

458
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,400
God, as I study Your Word, teach me Your Word, help me to understand Your Word, help me to

459
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,160
grow in my faith.

460
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,360
The Bible says, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow

461
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,960
thereby, and as you desire to grow, as you pray, God, would you help me to grow, that

462
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,340
is a prayer that is according to His will.

463
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,240
That God would teach us, akin to the growing spiritually, that He would teach us, that

464
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
He would guide us.

465
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,640
The psalmist often prays, God, teach me Thy statutes, teach me Thy Word.

466
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,240
Listen, when you go to the Word of God, you ought to be praying that God would teach you

467
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,200
His will, and as you pray according to His will, He's teaching you the Word of God.

468
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,920
It's amazing how this works.

469
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,480
And we find that He would say, listen, if you would pray, God, would you be glorified

470
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,180
in my life?

471
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,880
Is that a prayer that's according to the will of God?

472
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Certainly it is.

473
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,280
God, would you use me?

474
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,080
Would you help me to be used of Thee?

475
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,760
Would you help me to live my life in such a way that You would be glorified?

476
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,920
So we'd say something like John the Baptist said, that he must increase, but I must decrease.

477
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,640
God help me to glorify You.

478
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,960
That's a prayer that's according to the will of God.

479
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
That's a prayer that God desires to answer.

480
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
God, would you help me to see others saved?

481
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,320
Do you think that's a prayer that's according to the will of God?

482
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
God give me opportunities.

483
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,960
God help me to see the opportunities.

484
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,080
By the way, I mentioned that we have some Christmas tracts that I put out.

485
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,920
I gave out several of these yesterday.

486
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,720
You'd see how responsive people were to receiving these.

487
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,120
Why?

488
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,960
Hey, Merry Christmas with a smile.

489
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,640
By the way, don't be just a deadhead about it,

490
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,120
but give a smile and give them a gospel tract.

491
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,160
Tell them Merry Christmas.

492
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
They're nice.

493
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
They're attractive looking.

494
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,600
Man, people took them.

495
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,960
They appreciated it.

496
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,800
Lord, give me opportunities.

497
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,480
God, help me to speak to others about you.

498
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,120
That's a prayer that's according to his will.

499
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,240
Amen?

500
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
Now, it may not be that praying,

501
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,600
Lord, would you please relieve me of this ailment, this infirmity?

502
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,040
The reality is that God might say that it's my will that you have that.

503
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
See, we don't like that kind of thing.

504
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
But Paul said this,

505
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,160
that the things that happen to me happen for the furtherance of the gospel.

506
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,920
There are times that we might have difficulties,

507
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,760
and we might have health issues.

508
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,080
We may have some other types of things going on in our lives,

509
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,440
and God says, I can deliver you from that,

510
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,280
but my will is for you to have that so that you can glorify me.

511
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
Praying according to his will.

512
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
Praying according to his will.

513
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,200
Notice with me as we conclude in 1 John chapter 5,

514
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,800
and I begin to think about this really cycle, if you will,

515
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,680
and this praying and having confidence and knowing that God hears us,

516
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,760
and then praying according to his will.

517
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
I look at this passage of Scripture, and I've mentioned,

518
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,280
number one, that we notice a confidence that we're to have.

519
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,520
Number two, we notice the condition that is stated.

520
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,200
But number three, if you're taking notes,

521
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,240
we are to expect a closer walk with the Lord.

522
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,560
Pastor, what do you mean by that?

523
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,160
Well, I believe this is the product.

524
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,080
We look at this wonderful promise that's given to us in 1 John 5, verses 14 and 15,

525
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,600
and we begin to understand the privilege that we have of prayer,

526
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,320
and we understand the promise that he's given us.

527
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I believe that the product will be a closer walk with the Lord.

528
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,560
I've already mentioned this morning that it is the desire of God

529
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,400
that we would abide in him.

530
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,360
John chapter 15 deals with that quite extensively.

531
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,400
We've looked at 1 John chapter number one already this morning,

532
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,200
and we've understood that God's desire is that we would have fellowship with him.

533
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,320
And so as I begin to think about this passage of Scripture,

534
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,160
these two verses of Scripture,

535
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,720
and this confidence that we're to have in prayer,

536
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,080
and he says that if we know in verse number 15 that he hear us,

537
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,640
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him,

538
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,840
that we begin to understand that our God hears us,

539
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,000
and we're to pray according to his will.

540
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,520
And we said that in order to know his will, I spend time in his word.

541
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,280
So think about this, if you will, with me,

542
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,880
and I hope that I can effectively communicate this to you this morning.

543
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,200
But as I spend time with God in his word, I'm able to determine what his will is.

544
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,880
And as I'm determining his will, it's shaping and forming my prayer life.

545
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,800
And as I'm praying now according to his will, I'm seeing him answer prayers in my life.

546
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,160
And as he answers prayer in my life, as he answers prayer in your life,

547
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,720
you know what it does? It increases your faith,

548
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,200
but it also causes you to want to pray more.

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,200
It causes you to want to know more the will of God to get into his word even more.

550
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,440
And as we begin to see this truth that God is revealing to us

551
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,480
in these couple of verses of Scripture this morning,

552
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,440
and I believe that God wants us to understand this morning

553
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,200
that not only do we have this wonderful promise that God has given us with regard to prayer,

554
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,080
but really it is designed that we would be closer drawn to him.

555
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,680
Understand this morning that God is not a genie.

556
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,320
Some people have this idea, this make-believe idea that you get this genie,

557
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,880
and you rub this bottle, and you get these wishes.

558
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,880
And sometimes people treat God and treat prayer in that way.

559
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,800
We don't think about praying until we need something.

560
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,800
But as the people of God, when we understand that we're the sons of God,

561
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,640
when we understand how much he loves us, and he wants us to abide in him,

562
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,720
and he wants us to have fellowship with him,

563
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,880
then I spend time in his word, and then I pray according to his will.

564
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,600
It's interesting to me, the book of Proverbs,

565
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,840
turn over there if you will, Proverbs chapter 22,

566
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,520
and I want to draw a connection, and I hope that it helps you this morning.

567
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,720
God help me with this, I was praying this morning,

568
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,640
God help me to effectively communicate this thought this morning,

569
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,000
because God help me with this as I prepared this message

570
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,240
to understand how the promise and the privilege of prayer

571
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,200
is really this product, this closer walk with God.

572
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,480
And God desires us to be in his presence,

573
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,840
to have this abiding walk with him.

574
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,920
In Proverbs chapter 22, notice in verse number 17,

575
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,480
and notice the phraseology, the Bible says this,

576
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,240
bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,

577
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,720
and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.

578
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,880
And I want you to think about the picture that is given there in verse number 17,

579
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,280
as I've tried to draw the truth here of us trying to determine

580
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
the will of God in the word of God.

581
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,760
He says, bow down thine ear.

582
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,960
Do you get the picture that I'm listening intently,

583
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,400
that I'm listening intently,

584
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,520
that I'm giving my attention to being able to hear,

585
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,840
and to be able to know what God desires us to know.

586
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,640
We find that here Solomon, of course, is speaking to his son,

587
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,680
but I believe that the greater picture of the book of Proverbs

588
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,000
is not just Solomon speaking to Rehoboam,

589
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,720
but God speaking to us as his children.

590
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,680
And we find that he says, bow down thine ear.

591
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,520
Listen, sometimes we are so swift to speak,

592
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,920
and slow to hear,

593
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,280
but the reality is that we're to be slow to speak and swift to hear.

594
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
That's what God tells us.

595
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,280
Listen for the still, small voice.

596
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,680
Be still and know that I am God.

597
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,160
As we get into His presence,

598
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,080
and we're bowing down our ear to understand His will,

599
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,840
but then notice what the psalmist says,

600
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,640
turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, in Psalm 86,

601
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,040
I want you to see what is said here.

602
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,520
And I hope again, that it would help you this morning,

603
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,560
because as I am spending time in His word,

604
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,240
as I'm bowing down mine ear to hear and to understand,

605
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,880
and to learn what the will of God is,

606
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,360
that will then shape my prayer life,

607
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,720
because I am to pray according to His will.

608
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,200
And we know that if we pray according to His will,

609
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,320
that He's going to answer.

610
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,400
And I see prayers answered in my life,

611
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,720
and I'm encouraged, and I'm strengthened,

612
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,560
and my faith is increased, and I'm drawn closer to Him,

613
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,920
and I'm praying more, and I'm seeking Him more.

614
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,160
And it's a wonderful result,

615
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,360
a product of this privilege and this promise

616
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,560
that He's given us of prayer.

617
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,720
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 86.

618
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,280
We read what the wise man said in Proverbs

619
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,160
about us bowing down our ear to His word.

620
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,760
But notice what the psalmist says in verse one of Psalm 86.

621
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,320
"'Bow down thine ear, O Lord.

622
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,600
"'Hear me, for I am poor and needy.'"

623
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,600
We want God to bow down His ear to hear our prayers,

624
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,640
but we must first bow down our ear to understand His will.

625
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,800
And as I bow down mine ear to understand His will,

626
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,880
and I pray according to His will,

627
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,000
I can have confidence that He's gonna bow down His ear

628
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,840
to hear my prayer and to answer my prayer.

629
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,160
For indeed, I can relate to the psalmist,

630
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,320
I am poor and needy, amen.

631
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,400
And we find that as God has given us this privilege

632
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,080
and this promise of prayer,

633
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,840
and He wants us to have confidence,

634
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,800
but really when we dig in and we understand

635
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,480
what He's packaging for us and how He's giving us

636
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,200
and providing this truth for us,

637
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,040
He's really leading us to a place

638
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,240
where I'm developing a closer walk with Him,

639
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,040
just a closer walk with Him.

640
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,480
Listen, this ought to be not only the expectation,

641
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,360
but it ought to be the desire of every child of God

642
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,720
to be closer drawn to my Savior,

643
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,080
that I would be in His presence.

644
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,240
See, I don't want to just be a nominal Christian.

645
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't want to just be a surface flounder around,

646
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,000
just kind of convenient Christian.

647
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,840
I want to be all in.

648
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,720
I want to be close to my God.

649
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,280
And I have the promise that He's given

650
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,600
that if we draw nigh to Him, He'll draw nigh to us.

651
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,880
And when we understand this truth of prayer,

652
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,280
it's not just so that we can give our whole list

653
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
of wants and whatever.

654
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,240
No, no, no, we begin to say,

655
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,679
I'm praying according to His will.

656
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,840
How often I would challenge myself

657
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
and I would challenge you this morning

658
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,520
to evaluate your prayer life

659
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,760
and see how much of it is according to His will.

660
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,600
I mentioned before about praying out loud.

661
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,119
I mentioned also about recording yourself praying.

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm not sure if anyone's ever taken me up on that suggestion.

663
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,240
I've done it personally.

664
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,600
I've taken my phone and I've started record

665
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,800
and I've prayed out loud.

666
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
If I could go back and hear.

667
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Why?

668
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,800
It helps me to be able to evaluate, am I praying according to His will?

669
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,320
Am I rambling?

670
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,720
Am I just all over the place?

671
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,840
Is there some direction in my prayer?

672
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,720
I wouldn't do it every week, personally.

673
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,600
It was convicting, but it was helpful because we're to pray according to His will.

674
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,080
And as we pray according to His will, we have this great promise.

675
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,080
And as we see God answer prayer, listen, I hope it works this way in your life, it works

676
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
this way in my life.

677
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,800
When I see God answer prayer, I desire to pray more.

678
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,240
You see God answer prayer, and you see God answer prayer, and you're drawn closer to

679
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,420
Him, and you're studying His word, and you're learning His will, and you're praying according

680
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,040
to His will, and you're seeing Him answer prayer, and you're just drawn closer and closer

681
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,260
and closer to God.

682
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,540
We find that we're to walk with Him.

683
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,940
Enoch had this testimony.

684
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,060
He walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.

685
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,740
Noah was a man that walked with God.

686
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,140
We could begin to look at other examples in the Word of God of those that walked with

687
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
God.

688
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,140
And we find this morning that we're to have confidence in prayer.

689
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,460
There's a condition that is stated, but what thrills my soul is this product, this closer

690
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,060
walk with God.

691
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,220
And I hope this morning that it's not only something that we can expect to be the product,

692
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:38,620
but it is something that I truly desire, that you truly desire, a closer walk with Thee.

693
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
Let's pray together.

694
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,300
Father, we love You.

695
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,160
We thank You so much for loving us.

696
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,700
We thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together this morning.

697
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,060
We thank You for the truth of Your Word.

698
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,580
God, we thank You that You're a God who hears and answers prayer.

699
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,300
We're thankful that You're able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

700
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,100
We thank You for the countless promises that You've given us in Your Word with regard to

701
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,680
answered prayer.

702
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,380
We thank You for the multitudes of examples that You've given us in Your Word of You answering

703
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:19,620
prayer, of responding to those of Your children that have prayed with those words, I have

704
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,300
heard Thy prayer.

705
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,620
God, I pray that You'd help us to understand this morning the great privilege that is ours

706
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,620
to pray.

707
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:33,740
I pray, God, that You'd help us to understand this morning this promise that You've given

708
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:39,220
to us and the condition that is stated with regard to the according to His will.

709
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:46,180
God, I pray that as we desire to be people of prayer, men and women of prayer, boys and

710
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:54,780
girls of prayer, that God, we would seek Your will through Your Word so that we would

711
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,980
truly pray according to Your will.

712
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:07,180
God, I pray that as we see You answer, see You work and move, as we pray according to

713
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:13,740
Your will and You answer in mighty ways, God, it's my prayer that it would cause us to draw

714
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,620
closer to Thee.

715
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,460
I pray that that would be the desire of every individual that's present this morning.

716
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,980
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

717
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,940
as their personal Savior.

718
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,380
We know that it is Your will that they would be saved.

719
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,260
It is our prayer this morning that You would save them, Lord, that they would understand

720
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,660
that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness

721
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,380
and of judgment to come.

722
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,100
They would understand that they're a sinner and there's only one Savior, His name is Jesus.

723
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,020
He lived a perfect and sinless life.

724
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,100
He went to a cruel cross.

725
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,100
He bled and He died.

726
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,140
He was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

727
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,860
There's one here, one on livestream that's not sure of heaven.

728
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,100
God, would You save them today?

729
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,340
Would You help them to call out to Thee?

730
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:07,180
Would they take the promise that's been given, for whosoever shall call upon the name of

731
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,980
the Lord shall be saved?

732
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,020
Father for every child of God, every one that's here that's been saved, that's been

733
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,380
born again, I pray that we desire to have a closer walk with Thee.

734
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,420
Lord, that You'd help us to get into Your Word, dig into Your Word to know Your will

735
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,420
and then to pray according to Thy will.

736
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,740
In these few moments of invitation, we pray that You'd have Your will in way, that You'd

737
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,740
work as only You can and we'll be careful to give You the honor and glory for it's in

738
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,660
Christ's name we pray.
