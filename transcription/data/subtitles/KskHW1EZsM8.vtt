00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Five, and they left the stool up here.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.760
Joseph, I can be as tall as you, amen?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.679
Praise the Lord, glory.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:09.140
Could you imagine if I was this tall?

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.439
Man, that's crazy.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.439
And to think about the first time,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.100
the first several times we ever sang as a family,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.840
Joseph would stand on that stool so that you could see him.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.719
Honestly, those of you that were here in the beginning,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.040
that when we got here, he had to stand on that stool

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.799
and you'd be able to see him over the pulpit

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.400
if he stood on the stool.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.959
And now we need to have him get on his knees

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:40.560
and we'd all be around the same height, amen?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.240
But that's special.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
I appreciate that song so very much

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.099
that Brianna and Lydia and Natalie sang.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.119
What a great truth, amen?

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.599
First John chapter number five.

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:55.000
First John chapter number five this morning.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.919
And be looking at verses 14 and 15

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:59.479
if you did notice on the back of the bulletin this morning,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.520
the title for the message, Confident Prayer.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.879
And I'm so thankful that as we study the book of First John

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.839
and we've been studying this book all year

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:09.580
and we've taken several weeks off here and there

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.959
with other messages and what have you

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.760
as the Lord has given leadership.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400
But as we've studied the book of First John,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.519
several things have really stood out to us.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.160
Of course, we've used as our theme, walking in the light

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.639
and the desire that we understand that God has for us

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:27.040
to have fellowship with him, to abide in him.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.879
And what a joy to know that we are able to have fellowship

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.879
with the God of the universe.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.319
That right there just should cause us to rejoice

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.139
and to just be so thankful that God Almighty

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.879
is interested in you as an individual.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.620
He's interested in me as an individual.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.680
Not only did he save me, but he also allows me

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.639
to have fellowship with him as often as I desire.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.360
That's precious.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.260
But we know that as we study the book of First John

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.379
that we've also understood that there are many things

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:00.199
that God wants us to know.

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:02.559
We find it as we study other portions of scripture

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.239
that we find regularly that God will say something like this

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.559
I would not have you be ignorant brethren.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.399
God wants his people to be informed.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.399
He wants us to have knowledge.

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.160
And as we've studied through the book of First John,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.800
we've made note that this word know or to know

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.559
or knowledge or knowing is a repeated word

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.440
throughout the book of First John.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.039
And God wants us to know some things.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.679
As we study the fourth chapter,

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.440
we found specifically and repeatedly

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.199
that God wants us to know that he loves us.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.039
By the way, aren't you so thankful for the love of God?

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.839
We sang this morning in Sunday school,

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:45.119
Jesus loves me, this I know.

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.479
For the Bible tells me so, amen.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.479
And God wants us to know some things.

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.960
He wants us to be informed.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.360
He wants us to have that knowledge

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.520
and knowledge gives us confidence.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.360
And we find that as we look at the passage of scripture

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.279
that is before us this morning in verses 14 and 15,

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.960
we find that God wants us to have confidence

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.360
when it comes to this matter of prayer.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.600
And we find that he says this in verse 14,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.000
John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
he says, and this is the confidence that we have in him.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.360
Him is Jesus, the son of God.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.839
The exalted savior, the one who's coming back.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.160
And he says that we would have confidence in him

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.160
that if we ask anything according to his will,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.119
he heareth us.

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.360
And if we know that he hear us,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.220
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.399
that we desired of him.

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.000
Confident prayer.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.000
John, the apostle, the disciple,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.919
he had the privilege of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.600
during his earthly ministry.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.000
He had the privilege of being an eyewitness

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520
to several of the miracles.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.699
And we find that even as John would begin writing

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.000
this particular book, he says in verse number two,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.699
and let me begin in verse number one of chapter one.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.039
He says that which was from the beginning,

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.539
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.040
which we have looked upon,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.760
and our hands have handled of the word of life.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.200
John was an eyewitness.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.160
He says in verse number two,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.260
for the life was manifested and we have seen it.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.100
And what do we do?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.079
We bear witness and show unto you that eternal life,

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:37.459
which was with the father and was manifested unto us,

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.880
that which we have seen and heard,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.079
declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.959
with us and truly our fellowship is with the father

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.959
and with his son, Jesus Christ.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.000
And these things write we unto you,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
notice what he says, that your joy may be full.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.799
As you study scripture and you interpret scripture

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.980
with scripture, you find that the psalmist says

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.000
that in his presence is fullness of joy.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.399
And here the Bible says that ye,

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:10.239
that your joy may be full.

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.640
And we find that the importance of fellowship

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.279
and understanding that John,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.480
he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.880
He was really part of that inner circle, if you will.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.440
You think about the 12 disciples,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.920
but then you think often where the Bible speaks

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.399
about Peter, James, and John.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.899
And the three of them had the opportunity to go in

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.459
and see some miracles that others did not have

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:35.399
the privilege of seeing, even some of the disciples

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.600
as far as them being performed.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.000
We find that Peter, James, and John were the three

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.320
that went with Jesus up on the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.640
And we find that John had the privilege

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.279
of walking with Christ.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.640
As he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.000
not only did he have the privilege of hearing

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.880
the teaching of Jesus, specifically with regard

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.679
to our subject this morning with regard to prayer,

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:00.880
but think about this, John had the privilege

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.559
of observing the prayer life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.720
Not only did John hear the instruction

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.119
that Jesus would give with regard to prayer,

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:17.720
remember what one question that the disciples asked Jesus,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720
Lord, teach us, teach us to pray, teach us to pray.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.160
We find that John received that instruction,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.720
but John also observed the prayer life of Jesus.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.600
And we often understand in John 18, I referenced it

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.440
when we looked at the truth of the Garden of Gethsemane,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.079
when Jesus was in Jerusalem, he oft would go to that place

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:45.959
and that was his prayer closet, if you will,

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.040
when he was in Jerusalem.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.799
You find that when he's there around the region of Galilee

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:53.559
that he would enter and he'd go into a mountain somewhere

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:56.579
and he'd pray, and you'd find that Jesus

00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:58.700
was giving that great example.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.839
The text that is before us this morning here

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.920
in 1 John 5, verses 14 and 15 really mirrors the truth

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.519
that John has stated earlier in this book.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.559
In 1 John 3, in verse number 22,

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.679
you might look just a page over in your Bible

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:16.600
and notice what he says here in 1 John 3, in verse number 22.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.079
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.660
But then notice what he says,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.600
because we keep his commandments and do those things

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.179
that are pleasing in his sight.

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:31.679
We find that as we're abiding in him and we're obeying him,

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:33.920
that it leads to that confident prayer.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.200
And we see also here in 1 John 5

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.519
that he begins to deal with the importance

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.760
of having confidence in prayer.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.000
Not only did John write that here

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.500
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.000
but I wanna read to you what John would have heard

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the Lord Jesus Christ say before he went

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.559
to the cross of Calvary.

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:53.959
In John chapter number 14,

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.519
oftentimes as we think about that portion of scripture

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.279
or that chapter in the word of God,

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.399
we think about verse number six where Jesus said,

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:01.920
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.600
No man cometh unto me, or no man cometh unto the Father,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.480
but by me.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.679
And it's a verse of scripture that we've often quoted

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:11.679
and repeated and certainly an important verse of scripture.

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:13.480
But just shortly after that,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.799
Jesus spoke these words in John 14,

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:18.760
in verses 13 and 14, he says,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.200
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.119
that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:29.519
If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:32.520
Begin to think about the promises that God has given us

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.880
with regard to prayer.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.359
We begin to think about the privilege

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:38.359
that God has given us as the people of God

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:41.159
to enter into his presence,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.299
to understand the privilege of prayer.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:45.640
This morning as we begin to think about

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.659
this confident prayer,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.200
I want you to just notice a few things.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.599
Notice with me first of all,

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:51.000
and we've used it for the title,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.960
but also as we begin the message this morning,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.880
notice the confidence we are to have.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.200
In verse number 14 of 1 John chapter number five,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.380
he says, and this is the confidence that we have in him.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.799
Notice the confidence isn't in you,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.159
the confidence isn't necessarily in the prayer,

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.400
meaning some kind of rote religion,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.159
if you could understand what I mean by that.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:15.679
It's not that somebody has written out some prayers

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.719
and we have a prayer book or a prayer journal

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:20.080
and there's some faith in those prayers

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.479
or some confidence in those prayers.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:27.440
No, he says this is the confidence that we have in him,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.219
in the one that we're praying to.

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:30.559
There are times that people say,

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:32.919
well, I just don't know how to pray.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.280
It doesn't, I'm not sure, I'm not articulate,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.880
I'm not really good with my words.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.359
God knows that and God just wants to hear you pray.

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:45.119
Our confidence is not in the eloquence of our prayer,

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:50.119
our confidence is the one that we're praying to, amen.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.599
There's some times that people will hear somebody pray,

00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:54.880
by the way, think about the religious leaders of the day,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.039
they would stand and they would pray,

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:59.960
oh, our God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and so on

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.920
so forth, right? And what did Jesus say about those ones that prayed that way that everyone

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.080
would see them? He said, they have their reward. You know what their reward was? Being seen

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:18.520
of men. Somebody saying, oh, did you hear how he prayed? No, no. Our confidence is in

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:25.960
him. And I'm so thankful that access to the throne room of heaven has been provided by

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.080
the Lord Jesus Christ and that he desires that his children would pray, not only with

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.160
confidence, but with boldness. We think about the truth of Hebrews four in verse number

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.120
16, where the Bible says that we're to enter with boldness and think about how we find

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.600
it written here in Hebrews four and verse number 16, again, dealing with the fact that

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.180
we have a great high priest, the Lord Jesus Christ that is ever living to make intercession

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.020
for us. And he says in Hebrews four in verse number 16, let us therefore come boldly under

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:07.260
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.620
We think about that word that he uses in Hebrews four in verse 16, that we would come boldly.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.180
And we think about this truth in verse 14, and this is the confidence. And really it's

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.420
interesting, the word translated confidence and the word translated boldly are the same

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.980
Greek word. God wants us to have confidence. He wants us to have that boldness as we enter

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.620
into his presence. Why? Understanding that he ever lives to make intercession for us,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:39.300
understanding that there's one God and one mediator between man and God, the man, Christ

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:46.820
Jesus. And I'm so thankful that we have direct access to God in prayer. I don't have to wait

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.580
for someone else to be able to pray to God for. I don't have to go somewhere else. I

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:58.340
can find any time, any place, anywhere for any reason, I can go to my God in prayer,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:05.380
in confidence. He says, then this is the confidence that we have in him. Paul says it this way

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.040
in first Timothy chapter number two, when he talks about, first of all, that prayers

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.860
and supplications will be made. He says this, I will therefore that men pray everywhere

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:21.100
lifting up holy hands, and then he says this in verse number eight, without wrath and doubting.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.960
Without wrath and doubting. And so we find that we as the people of God, we are rejoicing

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.460
and understanding that we have confidence in him. There are times in which we've had

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.220
people that we've placed confidence in. The Bible talks about putting confidence in unfaithful

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.700
man. It's like a foot out of joint. It's like a broken tooth. Listen, our God is faithful

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.380
and it is never, as we think about in this passage of scripture, when we pray to him

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:52.280
and we look to him and we have confidence in him that he hears us. We had testimony

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.500
time on Tuesday evening for prayer, praise, and pie. There were many that were rejoicing

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.760
and thanking God for hearing our prayers and for answering prayer. And Brianna made the

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.480
statement that we can pray and he can hear all of us at the same time. God's never busy.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.160
It's never a situation where he doesn't hear us when we go to him in prayer, when he has

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.720
that ability. You ever been in a situation where two people are talking to you at the

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.880
same time? Most people say, hey listen, one at a time. God can hear all of us. And he

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.280
knows exactly what we're praying. And we have confidence in him. Think about this truth.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.080
Turn to the book of Matthew, if you will. Look at what Jesus is teaching. This is during

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.180
the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, 6, and 7. And I want you to see what Jesus says

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:47.640
here with regard to prayer. In Matthew chapter number 7, this ought to encourage you this

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:55.120
morning and help us to have confidence. Notice in verse 7 of Matthew 7, Jesus begins and

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.160
says this, ask and it shall be given you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.840
be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth. And

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.520
to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Notice what he says in verse number 9, or what man

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:22.400
is there of you whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Isn't that a great

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.440
example, analogy? Hey listen, if your son asks you for bread, are you going to give

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:37.680
him a stone? Surely not. Notice in verse number 10, or if he ask a fish, will he give

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:50.640
him a serpent? If ye then, verse number 11, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto

00:14:50.640 --> 00:15:00.480
your children. Notice these three words, how much more? How much more shall your Father

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:08.160
which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Isn't that wonderful? He says

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.240
listen, you, I mean compared to God and His holiness, he says you're evil and you know

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.020
how to give good gifts. If your son comes and says can I have bread, you're not going

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.420
to give him a stone. If he asks for a fish, you're not going to give him a serpent. And

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:30.700
so how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.820
him? Wow, the confidence that we're to have in knowing that He hears us. How many times,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.780
and we don't have the time this morning to look at the examples, but how many times as

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:46.700
we read the word of God do we read where the Bible tells us that God heard their prayers.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:53.020
In fact, we find right here in this passage of Scripture in 1 John 5, it says that this

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.700
is the confidence that we have in Him that if we ask anything according to His will,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:04.100
He heareth us. And if we know that He heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.100
the petitions that we desired of Him. God wants His children to have confidence when

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.580
we pray. I remember as a child, my parents aren't here, they're traveling, I don't think

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.820
they're watching live stream this morning, but I don't mind if they are or if you tell

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:24.580
them, it's not a secret. But sometimes children, and I remember being this way, sometimes children

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.820
have more confidence asking mom for something than asking dad for something. Any of you

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.500
ever had that experience? And I had that experience as a child, I'd go ask my mom for certain

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:42.140
things and she'd say this, ask dad. Like, well, you know, could you do it for me? You

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.540
know, that kind of thing, right? And I know even sometimes for my children, they'll ask

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.700
Holly something before they might ask me. Brianna's smiling and Joseph is kind of holding

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.580
back a smile back there. And I don't know why that is, why that's so standard, just

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.820
a typical nature, human nature. But understand this morning that though as humans there are

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.620
times that we might not have confidence asking somebody, when we think about the truth of

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:14.020
my relationship with the God of the universe, because I've been saved, I'm His child, I'm

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.020
to have absolute confidence. Notice what he says in chapter number three of this book,

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.340
and then we'll get into the next point. In 1 John chapter number three, and I want this

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:27.540
to sink in this morning when we think about this truth of having confidence in prayer,

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.480
because really it all is leading up to this passage that we're looking at with this confidence

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.420
in prayer. I mentioned about the fourth chapter, knowing that He loves us, but notice what

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.100
He says in verse number one of 1 John chapter three.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:46.740
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, and then notice this, that

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:55.100
we should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.980
Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.140
but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:13.220
He is. He then talks about purity in the next verse of Scripture and how important that

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.380
is, but I want you to understand this morning when we think about this confident prayer

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.660
that we understand I'm His child. How did I become His son? By trusting the Lord Jesus

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.060
Christ as my personal Savior. This morning if you know that you're a son of His, that

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.020
you've trusted, you've placed your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and He

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.460
is your Savior, the Bible says that you are His son. You're His child. You're His son

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:43.619
or His daughter. You are His child and you are to have confidence that you can go to

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:50.300
Him in prayer. Isn't that awesome? Notice as we continue looking at the passage of Scripture,

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:55.020
we notice that there is a condition stated. Number one, we notice the confidence we are

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.540
to have. Number two, we notice the condition that is stated. The Bible says this, and this

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.980
is the confidence, verse 14, that we have in Him, that if we ask anything and then notice

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:11.700
this phrase, according to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He heareth us, what

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.660
shall we ask? We know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. Some people say, well,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.500
I said if you ask, you're going to receive. I asked Him for a million bucks and I'm waiting

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.580
for my million dollars. That's not what the Bible teaches. Amen? Now God might bless you

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.619
with a million dollars and that's perfectly fine if God would do that because He knows

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:34.020
that He can entrust you with that and that you would use it for His honor and for His

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.540
glory. But we understand that as we look here at the passage of Scripture that there is

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.940
this condition that is stated that He says that it's according to His will. And so the

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.260
believer, the child of God, the one that has that relationship with the God of Heaven that

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:53.300
understands that they can come in confidence in Him, come in boldness through the throne

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.980
of grace, we are to pray according to His will. So the big question then would be how

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.200
How do we know His will?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.400
Through His Word.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.480
God has revealed to us in His Word, His will.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:15.440
We find that we have, Paul says in the church in Corinth, we have the mind of Christ.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.760
He says this, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus in Philippians chapter

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760
number 2.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.320
And we find that we have the very Word of God and as we desire to know the will of God,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.100
as we desire to pray according to the will of God, we dig into the Word of God and we

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.880
discover the will of God.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.120
Paul prayed that this thorn in his side would depart from him, but God said my grace is

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120
sufficient.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.400
So we find that in that passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, that it

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.960
was not the will of God to deliver Paul from that thorn in his side.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.840
Could God have delivered him?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.560
No.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.140
But Paul learned a great lesson in not being delivered by that thorn in his side, but understanding

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.080
that God said my grace is sufficient for you.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.880
So we begin to understand how is it that we would pray according to His will.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.820
Well we understand the condition that is stated here in 1 John chapter number 5, but we also

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.240
understand this is what Jesus taught.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.720
Go over to the book of Luke if you will, we'll look at a couple of verses of scripture in

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.400
the book of Luke, and understand this is what Jesus taught, Luke chapter number 11.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:30.320
And understand that here in this passage of scripture is where we find the disciple

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.260
that stands up and says, Lord teach us to pray.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:39.500
It was a certain place that they were, and one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord teach

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.640
us to pray.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:48.980
I'm thankful that this disciple asked the Lord this pertinent, relevant question.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.600
We find that Jesus would give an answer, and He said to them in verse number 2, by the

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.280
way this is not the Lord's prayer, this is a model prayer, and we find that Jesus says

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:04.160
this in verse number 2, when ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160
Thy name.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.080
You enter into His presence recognizing His holiness.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:17.500
He is holy, our God is holy, holy, holy, holy.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.600
We enter into His presence.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.360
By the way, because He is holy, He has given us the truth on how we approach Him.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.440
We don't just approach Him any old way we want.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.680
By the way, come back this evening, we'll be looking at Galatians chapter number 3,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.480
and answering a question in the Ask the Pastor series with regard to what meaneth the law.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.800
And really what we learn as we study the Old Testament with regard to our approach to God.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.200
So many people today are throwing the Old Testament out.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.840
It's not relevant, we don't need it.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.800
While God is the same yesterday and today and forever, I'm thankful that I don't have

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.840
to follow the law, but the law does teach me some things, amen?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.480
And I'm thankful that Jesus fulfilled the law, glory, hallelujah, amen?

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.600
But the reality is we find here that Jesus says, listen, recognize that you're entering

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.360
into the presence of a thrice holy God.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.320
He says this, Thy kingdom come, notice this phrase, Thy will be done.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.920
As in heaven, so in earth.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.040
And so Jesus taught that we're to pray according to the will of God.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.840
Not only did Jesus teach that, but Jesus practiced that.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.880
Look over in Luke chapter number 22, if you will, in Luke chapter number 22, and we'll

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.000
just look at one of the examples here when He's praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.160
The Bible tells us in verse number 39 of Luke chapter number 22, and He came out and went

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.800
as He was wont to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples also followed Him, and so we

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.040
find that He's there and Jesus is going to pray in the garden.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.040
He says to the disciples in verse number 40, when He was at the place, He said unto them,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.840
pray that ye enter not into temptation.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.880
And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
Notice what He prayed.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.880
He had taught that they're to pray according to His will.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:08.560
He says, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.760
but thine be done.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.600
By the way, I do not believe that Jesus was praying to not go to the cross.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.880
That's not what He was praying.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.040
Some people teach that.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.320
I do not believe that for one second.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.600
I believe that all of the forces of hell were trying to kill Jesus in the garden so that

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.480
He could never make it to the cross.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.400
Because if He made it to the cross, that was the fulfillment of prophecy and that was what

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.360
was required for man to be redeemed.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.360
Amen?

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:45.640
And so we find that as we look here at this truth in Luke chapter number 22 and understand

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.600
what He's praying, how would He pray?

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.840
Why would He pray that He would not go to the cross?

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.480
And Hebrews tells us that for the joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.480
right?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480
What was the joy?

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.800
The fact that souls would be saved, lives would be changed.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.240
He said that He came to do the will of His Father.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.840
And He knew that from before the foundation of the world, that it was appointed that He

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.480
would be the Lamb that was slain on the cross of Calvary.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.120
That was all for free, not part of the message on prayer.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120
Amen?

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.920
But I do not believe that's what Jesus was praying at all.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.000
He was praying according to the will of God and He knew that He was going to go to the

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
cross of Calvary.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.280
And so we know that Jesus taught, Jesus not only taught, but He practiced this truth that

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.640
is stated in 1 John 5 and verse number 14, the condition that we pray according to His

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.080
will.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.440
We will not take the time this morning, but if you were to do a Bible study, you would

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.600
find that if you go to the book of 1 Kings and chapter number 18 and then cross-reference

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.000
that with James chapter number 5, you will find that Elijah prayed with confidence.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Did he not?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.600
When you think about that showdown at Mount Carmel and all of those Baal worshipers came

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.440
and all that was taking place there, and we find that there Elijah prayed with confidence

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.240
and with boldness.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.120
Do you think that when Elijah prayed that he expected fire to fall from heaven?

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120
Hallelujah!

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:20.940
I mean, I don't think he had one part of his being that doubted for one nanosecond that

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.040
fire was not going to fall from heaven.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040
Why?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:30.840
Because he said this when he prayed, I have done all of this according to Thy word.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.140
Elijah knew that he was praying according to the will of God.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.920
He was doing everything that he did was according to the will of God.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:42.240
And the Bible tells us in James chapter number 5 that Elijah is a man just like we're men,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.640
but the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.640
And Elijah prayed with confidence, he prayed with boldness, he prayed according to the

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640
will of God.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.600
And so we understand the confidence that we're to have, but we notice that there's a condition

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.280
that is stated, and we begin to think about praying according to the will of God.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.960
Listen, as we think about praying according to the will of God, just a few thoughts this

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960
morning.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.680
Number one, it's God's will for all men to be saved.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.560
I believe that this morning.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.360
The Bible says that the Lord is not slack concerning His promises.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.720
Some men count slackness as He is not, He is long-suffering to us, we're not willing

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.680
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:31.200
The Bible tells us in 1 Timothy chapter number 2 that His will is that all men would be saved.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.840
He says this, the Bible tells us in Romans chapter number 10, for whosoever shall call

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.880
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.680
So I can have confidence as the one giving the instruction when I share the gospel with

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.480
someone and they understand that they're a sinner, they understand that they have violated

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.160
the law of God and they are guilty, they understand that Jesus fulfilled all that

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.880
was necessary for them to be saved, to be born again, and they understand that Jesus

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:05.760
bled and died, He was buried and He rose again, and they place their faith and trust in the

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.320
finished work of Christ at Calvary, that when I say to them, whosoever shall call upon the

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.200
name of the Lord shall be saved, and I say something like this, how do you call upon

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.760
the name of the Lord?

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.800
You pray.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.960
And I can tell you that that's a prayer that is according to the will of God.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.960
Amen?

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.760
Listen, let me tell you a prayer that's according to the will of God for your spiritual growth.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.960
You pray and ask God to help you grow spiritually, that's a prayer that's according to His will.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960
God help me to grow.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.400
God, as I study Your Word, teach me Your Word, help me to understand Your Word, help me to

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.160
grow in my faith.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.360
The Bible says, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.960
thereby, and as you desire to grow, as you pray, God, would you help me to grow, that

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.340
is a prayer that is according to His will.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.240
That God would teach us, akin to the growing spiritually, that He would teach us, that

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.240
He would guide us.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.640
The psalmist often prays, God, teach me Thy statutes, teach me Thy Word.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.240
Listen, when you go to the Word of God, you ought to be praying that God would teach you

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:18.200
His will, and as you pray according to His will, He's teaching you the Word of God.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.920
It's amazing how this works.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.480
And we find that He would say, listen, if you would pray, God, would you be glorified

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.180
in my life?

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.880
Is that a prayer that's according to the will of God?

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880
Certainly it is.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.280
God, would you use me?

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.080
Would you help me to be used of Thee?

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.760
Would you help me to live my life in such a way that You would be glorified?

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.920
So we'd say something like John the Baptist said, that he must increase, but I must decrease.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.640
God help me to glorify You.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.960
That's a prayer that's according to the will of God.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.960
That's a prayer that God desires to answer.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.240
God, would you help me to see others saved?

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.320
Do you think that's a prayer that's according to the will of God?

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.120
God give me opportunities.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.960
God help me to see the opportunities.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.080
By the way, I mentioned that we have some Christmas tracts that I put out.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.920
I gave out several of these yesterday.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.720
You'd see how responsive people were to receiving these.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.120
Why?

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.960
Hey, Merry Christmas with a smile.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.640
By the way, don't be just a deadhead about it,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.120
but give a smile and give them a gospel tract.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.160
Tell them Merry Christmas.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.880
They're nice.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.240
They're attractive looking.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.600
Man, people took them.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.960
They appreciated it.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.800
Lord, give me opportunities.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.480
God, help me to speak to others about you.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.120
That's a prayer that's according to his will.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.240
Amen?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.880
Now, it may not be that praying,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.600
Lord, would you please relieve me of this ailment, this infirmity?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.040
The reality is that God might say that it's my will that you have that.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.960
See, we don't like that kind of thing.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.840
But Paul said this,

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.160
that the things that happen to me happen for the furtherance of the gospel.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.920
There are times that we might have difficulties,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.760
and we might have health issues.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.080
We may have some other types of things going on in our lives,

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.440
and God says, I can deliver you from that,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.280
but my will is for you to have that so that you can glorify me.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.040
Praying according to his will.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.160
Praying according to his will.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.200
Notice with me as we conclude in 1 John chapter 5,

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.800
and I begin to think about this really cycle, if you will,

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.680
and this praying and having confidence and knowing that God hears us,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.760
and then praying according to his will.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.960
I look at this passage of Scripture, and I've mentioned,

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.280
number one, that we notice a confidence that we're to have.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.520
Number two, we notice the condition that is stated.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.200
But number three, if you're taking notes,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.240
we are to expect a closer walk with the Lord.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.560
Pastor, what do you mean by that?

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.160
Well, I believe this is the product.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.080
We look at this wonderful promise that's given to us in 1 John 5, verses 14 and 15,

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.600
and we begin to understand the privilege that we have of prayer,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.320
and we understand the promise that he's given us.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.320
I believe that the product will be a closer walk with the Lord.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.560
I've already mentioned this morning that it is the desire of God

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.400
that we would abide in him.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.360
John chapter 15 deals with that quite extensively.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.400
We've looked at 1 John chapter number one already this morning,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.200
and we've understood that God's desire is that we would have fellowship with him.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.320
And so as I begin to think about this passage of Scripture,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.160
these two verses of Scripture,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.720
and this confidence that we're to have in prayer,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.080
and he says that if we know in verse number 15 that he hear us,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.640
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.840
that we begin to understand that our God hears us,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.000
and we're to pray according to his will.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.520
And we said that in order to know his will, I spend time in his word.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.280
So think about this, if you will, with me,

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.880
and I hope that I can effectively communicate this to you this morning.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.200
But as I spend time with God in his word, I'm able to determine what his will is.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.880
And as I'm determining his will, it's shaping and forming my prayer life.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:15.800
And as I'm praying now according to his will, I'm seeing him answer prayers in my life.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.160
And as he answers prayer in my life, as he answers prayer in your life,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.720
you know what it does? It increases your faith,

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.200
but it also causes you to want to pray more.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.200
It causes you to want to know more the will of God to get into his word even more.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.440
And as we begin to see this truth that God is revealing to us

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.480
in these couple of verses of Scripture this morning,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.440
and I believe that God wants us to understand this morning

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.200
that not only do we have this wonderful promise that God has given us with regard to prayer,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.080
but really it is designed that we would be closer drawn to him.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.680
Understand this morning that God is not a genie.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.320
Some people have this idea, this make-believe idea that you get this genie,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.880
and you rub this bottle, and you get these wishes.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.880
And sometimes people treat God and treat prayer in that way.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.800
We don't think about praying until we need something.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.800
But as the people of God, when we understand that we're the sons of God,

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.640
when we understand how much he loves us, and he wants us to abide in him,

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.720
and he wants us to have fellowship with him,

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.880
then I spend time in his word, and then I pray according to his will.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.600
It's interesting to me, the book of Proverbs,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.840
turn over there if you will, Proverbs chapter 22,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.520
and I want to draw a connection, and I hope that it helps you this morning.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.720
God help me with this, I was praying this morning,

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.640
God help me to effectively communicate this thought this morning,

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.000
because God help me with this as I prepared this message

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.240
to understand how the promise and the privilege of prayer

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.200
is really this product, this closer walk with God.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.480
And God desires us to be in his presence,

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.840
to have this abiding walk with him.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.920
In Proverbs chapter 22, notice in verse number 17,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.480
and notice the phraseology, the Bible says this,

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.240
bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.720
and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.880
And I want you to think about the picture that is given there in verse number 17,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.280
as I've tried to draw the truth here of us trying to determine

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.280
the will of God in the word of God.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.760
He says, bow down thine ear.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.960
Do you get the picture that I'm listening intently,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.400
that I'm listening intently,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:42.520
that I'm giving my attention to being able to hear,

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.840
and to be able to know what God desires us to know.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.640
We find that here Solomon, of course, is speaking to his son,

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.680
but I believe that the greater picture of the book of Proverbs

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.000
is not just Solomon speaking to Rehoboam,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.720
but God speaking to us as his children.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.680
And we find that he says, bow down thine ear.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.520
Listen, sometimes we are so swift to speak,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.920
and slow to hear,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.280
but the reality is that we're to be slow to speak and swift to hear.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.560
That's what God tells us.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.280
Listen for the still, small voice.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.680
Be still and know that I am God.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.160
As we get into His presence,

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.080
and we're bowing down our ear to understand His will,

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.840
but then notice what the psalmist says,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.640
turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, in Psalm 86,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.040
I want you to see what is said here.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.520
And I hope again, that it would help you this morning,

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.560
because as I am spending time in His word,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.240
as I'm bowing down mine ear to hear and to understand,

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.880
and to learn what the will of God is,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.360
that will then shape my prayer life,

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.720
because I am to pray according to His will.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.200
And we know that if we pray according to His will,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.320
that He's going to answer.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.400
And I see prayers answered in my life,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.720
and I'm encouraged, and I'm strengthened,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.560
and my faith is increased, and I'm drawn closer to Him,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.920
and I'm praying more, and I'm seeking Him more.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.160
And it's a wonderful result,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.360
a product of this privilege and this promise

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.560
that He's given us of prayer.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.720
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 86.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.280
We read what the wise man said in Proverbs

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.160
about us bowing down our ear to His word.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.760
But notice what the psalmist says in verse one of Psalm 86.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.320
"'Bow down thine ear, O Lord.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.600
"'Hear me, for I am poor and needy.'"

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.600
We want God to bow down His ear to hear our prayers,

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.640
but we must first bow down our ear to understand His will.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.800
And as I bow down mine ear to understand His will,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.880
and I pray according to His will,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.000
I can have confidence that He's gonna bow down His ear

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.840
to hear my prayer and to answer my prayer.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.160
For indeed, I can relate to the psalmist,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.320
I am poor and needy, amen.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.400
And we find that as God has given us this privilege

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.080
and this promise of prayer,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.840
and He wants us to have confidence,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.800
but really when we dig in and we understand

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.480
what He's packaging for us and how He's giving us

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.200
and providing this truth for us,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.040
He's really leading us to a place

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.240
where I'm developing a closer walk with Him,

00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:38.040
just a closer walk with Him.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.480
Listen, this ought to be not only the expectation,

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.360
but it ought to be the desire of every child of God

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.720
to be closer drawn to my Savior,

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.080
that I would be in His presence.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.240
See, I don't want to just be a nominal Christian.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.000
I don't want to just be a surface flounder around,

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.000
just kind of convenient Christian.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.840
I want to be all in.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.720
I want to be close to my God.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.280
And I have the promise that He's given

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.600
that if we draw nigh to Him, He'll draw nigh to us.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.880
And when we understand this truth of prayer,

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.280
it's not just so that we can give our whole list

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.400
of wants and whatever.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.240
No, no, no, we begin to say,

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.679
I'm praying according to His will.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.840
How often I would challenge myself

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.440
and I would challenge you this morning

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.520
to evaluate your prayer life

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.760
and see how much of it is according to His will.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.600
I mentioned before about praying out loud.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.119
I mentioned also about recording yourself praying.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.960
I'm not sure if anyone's ever taken me up on that suggestion.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.240
I've done it personally.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.600
I've taken my phone and I've started record

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.800
and I've prayed out loud.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.800
If I could go back and hear.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800
Why?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:08.800
It helps me to be able to evaluate, am I praying according to His will?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.320
Am I rambling?

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.720
Am I just all over the place?

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.840
Is there some direction in my prayer?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.720
I wouldn't do it every week, personally.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:25.600
It was convicting, but it was helpful because we're to pray according to His will.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.080
And as we pray according to His will, we have this great promise.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.080
And as we see God answer prayer, listen, I hope it works this way in your life, it works

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080
this way in my life.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.800
When I see God answer prayer, I desire to pray more.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.240
You see God answer prayer, and you see God answer prayer, and you're drawn closer to

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.420
Him, and you're studying His word, and you're learning His will, and you're praying according

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:51.040
to His will, and you're seeing Him answer prayer, and you're just drawn closer and closer

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.260
and closer to God.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.540
We find that we're to walk with Him.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.940
Enoch had this testimony.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.060
He walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.740
Noah was a man that walked with God.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.140
We could begin to look at other examples in the Word of God of those that walked with

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.140
God.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.140
And we find this morning that we're to have confidence in prayer.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:21.460
There's a condition that is stated, but what thrills my soul is this product, this closer

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.060
walk with God.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.220
And I hope this morning that it's not only something that we can expect to be the product,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:38.620
but it is something that I truly desire, that you truly desire, a closer walk with Thee.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.620
Let's pray together.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.300
Father, we love You.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.160
We thank You so much for loving us.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.700
We thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together this morning.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.060
We thank You for the truth of Your Word.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.580
God, we thank You that You're a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.300
We're thankful that You're able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.100
We thank You for the countless promises that You've given us in Your Word with regard to

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.680
answered prayer.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:12.380
We thank You for the multitudes of examples that You've given us in Your Word of You answering

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:19.620
prayer, of responding to those of Your children that have prayed with those words, I have

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.300
heard Thy prayer.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:27.620
God, I pray that You'd help us to understand this morning the great privilege that is ours

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.620
to pray.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.740
I pray, God, that You'd help us to understand this morning this promise that You've given

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.220
to us and the condition that is stated with regard to the according to His will.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:46.180
God, I pray that as we desire to be people of prayer, men and women of prayer, boys and

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:54.780
girls of prayer, that God, we would seek Your will through Your Word so that we would

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.980
truly pray according to Your will.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:07.180
God, I pray that as we see You answer, see You work and move, as we pray according to

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:13.740
Your will and You answer in mighty ways, God, it's my prayer that it would cause us to draw

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.620
closer to Thee.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.460
I pray that that would be the desire of every individual that's present this morning.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:25.980
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.940
as their personal Savior.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.380
We know that it is Your will that they would be saved.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.260
It is our prayer this morning that You would save them, Lord, that they would understand

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.660
that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.380
and of judgment to come.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.100
They would understand that they're a sinner and there's only one Savior, His name is Jesus.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.020
He lived a perfect and sinless life.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.100
He went to a cruel cross.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.100
He bled and He died.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:56.140
He was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.860
There's one here, one on livestream that's not sure of heaven.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.100
God, would You save them today?

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.340
Would You help them to call out to Thee?

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:07.180
Would they take the promise that's been given, for whosoever shall call upon the name of

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.980
the Lord shall be saved?

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.020
Father for every child of God, every one that's here that's been saved, that's been

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.380
born again, I pray that we desire to have a closer walk with Thee.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.420
Lord, that You'd help us to get into Your Word, dig into Your Word to know Your will

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.420
and then to pray according to Thy will.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.740
In these few moments of invitation, we pray that You'd have Your will in way, that You'd

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.740
work as only You can and we'll be careful to give You the honor and glory for it's in

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.660
Christ's name we pray.
