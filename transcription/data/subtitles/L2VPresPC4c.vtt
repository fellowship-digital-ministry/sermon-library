WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
Number 11 and we've been studying through the book of Hebrews here on Sunday mornings and of course our theme for

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:13.039
2020 looking unto Jesus. I'm thankful that he is the author and he is the finisher of our faith

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.239
Amen, and what a wonderful blessing. We've been called to run a race and as we run our race, we've been

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.040
Instructed to keep our eyes upon the Lord Jesus Christ and what a blessing I've often said throughout this year

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.240
of course many things that have occurred that none of us could have ever expected or

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.639
Anticipated but we've often said that we can have the peace of God which passeth all understanding

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:40.680
we can have joy and hope and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.360
All of those wonderful things why not because we have our head in the sand

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.740
But because we have our eyes on our Savior, amen, and we serve a great God

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.860
He is the Lord God omnipotent and he does reign

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:00.900
Amen and we had the opportunity yesterday to do a little kayaking and what a joy to see the beauty of God's creation and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.699
Just to be able to just sit in amazement of his handiwork. Amen, and what a blessing

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:15.300
We're so thankful for all that God has done for us. We begin our journey this morning through Hebrews chapter 11

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.339
I believe that we could spend months going through this particular chapter

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:24.099
We don't have months to go through Hebrews chapter 11 if we're going to finish in

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:31.139
2020 my plan is to preach five messages from this passage of scripture from Hebrews 11

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.220
I will not say over the next five weeks because next week is revival meeting

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.319
I will not be preaching from the book of Hebrews, but we will be having a special message next Sunday morning

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.019
and so for five messages

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.739
I plan to go through the book or the

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.300
11th chapter here of the book of Hebrews and if we're able to do that

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.519
It should keep us on schedule for being able to can complete the book of Hebrews here in

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:59.660
2020 it is interesting as we begin chapter number 11. The Bible says now faith is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.959
the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:10.020
For by it the elders obtained a good report through faith. We

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:14.179
Understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.740
So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.580
If we look at these first three verses of Hebrews 11

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.100
I'm going to title the message now faith is just from verse number one there

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.699
And it's interesting as we studied through the 10th chapter over the last several weeks

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:38.059
We understood that in Hebrews 10 in verse number 22 that the recipients were instructed to let us draw near

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.820
With a true heart remember this in full assurance of faith

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.300
Later in the chapter. They were instructed in verse number

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.740
37 excuse me 38 now the just shall live by faith

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.500
and then it's interesting as we end the

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.539
Chapter the 10th chapter and you come to the latter part of verse number 39

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.619
It says but we are of them that believe to the saving of the soul

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.779
We're not of them who draw back unto perdition

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:18.940
but we're of them that believe to the saving of the soul and then the writer says now faith is

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:24.860
And he's going to give us this great description of what faith is. And of course we understand

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.940
The content of Hebrews chapter 11 if you've been around the Lord's work for any length of time

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:38.699
you've had an understanding many throughout the years have referred to Hebrews 11 as the hall of faith chapter and

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.720
Throughout the chapter. We have the opportunity to see how that

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.899
Those that have gone on before us by faith what they did

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:53.740
It's interesting. I believe that the subject matter of faith is a fascinating study

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.500
In fact as you study throughout the Word of God and you study

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:02.259
Various aspects of faith and those that exercise faith

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.259
and of course

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:10.380
Even as you consider the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and how so often as he would interact not only with his

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:15.660
Disciples but others in whom he had the opportunity to minister to during his earthly ministry

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.500
You find that he often refers to the subject matter of faith and we find that it is a fascinating study

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.640
We know there are many that have lived and gone before us those in the scriptures that we could read of but even others

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.380
That would be our contemporaries if you will that we would say they they lived by faith. They had great faith

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.260
They believed God

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.380
One of those men that some of you may be familiar with is. Dr. Lee Robertson

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.619
he is with the Lord now and the Lord used brother Robertson in a great way and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.459
He had the opportunity to start a church and start a Bible College and

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:56.619
Many people were trained for the ministry people that were scattered all throughout the world

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.540
serving God in various capacities and they had

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.779
10,000 members in their church

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.299
they had satellite churches all across the area in Tennessee in which they

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.980
Had their church and when brother Robertson was in his 90s nearing the end of his journey here upon earth

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.260
He had the opportunity to have some conversation with Clarence Sexton

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.700
Clarence Sexton also pastors down in Tennessee

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:28.380
he is still alive today and pastoring the Temple Baptist Church in Powell, Tennessee and

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:34.339
He asked dr. Robertson this question. He said if there was one thing that you could go back and change

00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:36.779
what would it be and

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:44.420
This man that had exercised great faith in God throughout his life and ministry said this to have more faith

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.339
In God to have more faith in God

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:54.660
It is interesting for the disciples when they were there with the Lord Jesus Christ and receiving instruction

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.940
We find it in Luke 17 in verse number 5. They say to the Lord Jesus Christ. They say increase our faith

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.700
We understand the Bible tells us in Romans 10 in verse number 17

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.140
So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.420
And we understand even as we concluded last week that we have a

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:22.619
Responsibility as the people of God to live by faith that reference that we found at the end of Hebrews chapter number 10

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.339
That is contained not only here in the book of Hebrews

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.380
But we find also in the book of Romans in the book of Galatians that quote from the prophet Habakkuk

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.380
The just shall live by faith

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.859
And we understand the importance of this subject matter

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:42.339
And as we begin looking at this 11th chapter these first three verses give us a good foundation

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:51.179
To have a proper understanding of all that will be discussed in this chapter notice with me if you're taking notes first of all faith

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.739
explained

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:58.660
Faith explained now there are some in our world today that have a misunderstanding of what faith is

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.540
Not only are there some in our world today that have a misunderstanding of what faith is

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.380
But I believe there are some even of the household of faith that have a misunderstanding of what faith is

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:15.500
and so we find that here in the scriptures that God is giving us and the people that have just been instructed these

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:23.179
Recipients that have been told how superior our God is and how Christ is better than the angels. He's better than the prophets

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:25.700
He's better than Moses. He's better than Abraham

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.459
He's better than the the the Levitical the Aaronic priesthood and he's so much greater

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:37.660
He's far superior and then they're told to live by faith and then faith is explained to them

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.299
even before we see the

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.019
Expression of faith through all of those that would be referenced in Hebrews chapter 11

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:51.299
By the way, many of these folks that were referenced in Hebrews chapter 11. We have a good understanding

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:55.899
If we've been around church, we've been around the Bible for any length of time

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:01.140
We have a good understanding of many of these characters that are referenced how much greater

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:09.739
understanding these Jewish believers would have had of these people that are referenced in Hebrews chapter number 11 and

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.500
We find that here as faith is explained. He says now faith is notice this word

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:19.339
substance faith is the

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.420
Substance of things hoped for the interesting aspect as we look at this word

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.579
Substances it is that which rest upon fact

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.619
That which rest upon fact, it's not a theory. It's not a hypothesis

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.179
when we think about

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:44.619
Substance he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for we would gather from that

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.460
Descriptive term substance that it results in us having a level of confidence and assurance

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.460
It is that which provides for us as the people of God that firm

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:00.140
foundation and he says that faith is

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.619
Substance it is the substance of things hoped for but then he uses this term

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:11.099
He says it is the evidence of things not seen

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.179
So we see two descriptive terms here substance of things hoped for

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:20.460
Evidence of things not seen that word evidence. It's interesting. It is a word

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.380
that would be used and

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.500
That which is accepted for conviction

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:31.260
Now we understand we have in our minds even we think about that

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:35.719
Word evidence and thinking about that which would be accepted for conviction

00:09:35.719 --> 00:09:42.280
We'd have our minds maybe in a court of law and understanding charges that have been brought against

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:50.400
Somebody and as those charges are brought against an individual there has to be evidence in order to have a conviction

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.559
If there's no evidence if the evidence is not there if it's not provided

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.159
It's not likely that you're going to get the conviction

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:06.959
And so we find that he says that it is the substance of things hope for that which rest upon facts

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:13.679
It is not a theory. It's not a hypothesis. It results in us as the people of God having confidence and assurance

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:18.239
It's that firm foundation, but it's also that evidence

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:20.839
That proof if you will

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.599
Now you understand this morning

00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:26.119
that every day

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:28.319
We do certain things by faith. In

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:35.559
In fact, I would argue this morning that every person that walks upon the face of this earth

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.719
exercises faith

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:44.159
When they get into an automobile they exercise faith and those particular

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:50.159
Elements that were used to construct that vehicle when they walk into a building when you cross a bridge

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:53.439
You're exercising faith and the person that designed that

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:59.599
That bridge the architects that designed it the the people that have not only

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:03.719
built the bridge, but the materials in which the bridge is made of

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.639
Now we don't think about it that way though, right?

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:11.519
Most of us we just go ahead and drive right over the bridge. I think about ladders

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.959
So it's a good illustration of faith. You've got to get on the ladder

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:20.399
I remember Ed and Jackie over in the fellowship hall and Ed might remember this a number of years ago

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:25.759
It was right after we had gotten here and it's probably about eight and a half years ago

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:29.799
and we were doing a project here and Ed brought a ladder and

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:35.279
The ladder that Ed brought must have been his father's it was in old old shape

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:40.719
I mean it was not looking so good and I weigh a few more pounds than Ed does and Ed says, oh, it's good

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:42.679
I said, how about I hold it for you? Amen

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.119
I didn't have any faith in that ladder

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:50.079
That it was going to support me that I could climb up on it. And so I

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:55.959
Acknowledged the situation I looked at and I said no, I'm not going to step on that ladder. I didn't trust it

00:11:55.959 --> 00:12:00.879
I didn't have faith that I could stand upon that ladder and we think about faith

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:05.439
It's action as we go throughout the book of the 11th chapter the book of Hebrews over the next several weeks

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:11.359
We'll find that faith results in action, but we see that it's this substance. It's this evidence

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:16.039
I've often said throughout the years that a simple definition of faith is this

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:18.999
Taking God at his word

00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:21.959
Taking God at his word

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:26.899
The question really comes down to this. Do we believe what God said?

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:36.879
Many years ago when I worked in the corporate world and I was dealing with a very high-profile project and I worked in the

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:41.759
The procurement department we had a very very important project that was coming up

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:49.119
Customers were coming in to take delivery of a 50 million dollar aircraft and they had the potential of purchasing more aircraft

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:53.879
it was a very very serious situation and we were missing some parts and

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:57.999
It was absolutely critical that those parts arrived tomorrow

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:05.139
And I remember the particular vendor that I was working with on that project was a vendor out in

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:13.019
California and I was contacting them regularly and I was trying to get that tracking number so that I could have some type of

00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:17.599
Just proof if you will that it was actually shipping. It was going to arrive

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:22.139
And I remember as I spoke with that man late in the day

00:13:22.859 --> 00:13:27.659
Still no tracking number available. He says you just have to have faith man

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:30.619
And I said, I don't have any faith in you

00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:38.499
All right, and I want I want to have a tracking number. I want to have some see but God's given us this book

00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:41.499
We're taking God at his word

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:49.859
We're saying I'm believing what God says see when that individual finally provided me with a tracking number number

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:56.819
I had a certain level of confidence that we were going to get the items that we needed

00:13:56.819 --> 00:14:01.879
Why because I had something other than his word. I wasn't trusting his word

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:06.539
See, we have the God of the universe who's given us this precious book

00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:10.139
That's been preserved for us that people throughout the ages

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:16.339
Have fought to defend and to deliver to a next generation and it is the source of our faith

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:18.939
and this morning

00:14:18.939 --> 00:14:20.939
We think about faith we say

00:14:21.579 --> 00:14:23.579
That we take God at his word

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:29.779
It's the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen I have absolute assurance

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:33.499
That God will do what he said. He will do

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:37.659
He always has he always will amen

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:44.459
This morning. We're familiar with the bumper sticker. That was very popular years ago

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:49.939
I've not seen it often in recent years where the bumper sticker would say God said it

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:56.299
I believe it that settles it. I've often said that it doesn't matter if you believe it or not if

00:14:56.939 --> 00:15:00.579
God said it that settles it. Amen

00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:09.219
You believing it or not believing it will not change the truth. We can't change truth truth is truth

00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:15.979
We find that the Apostle Paul said this in 2nd Timothy chapter number 1 in verse number 12

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:20.259
He says for the witch cause I also saw suffer these things nevertheless

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:24.459
I am NOT ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am

00:15:25.099 --> 00:15:29.339
Persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:34.459
Against that day. I want you to think about that word persuaded keep in your mind just for a moment

00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:36.459
Maybe write it in your notes. I want you to

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:42.819
Reference back to that in just a moment. Paul says this in Acts 27 in verse number 25

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:45.459
And it's a great declaration

00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:49.339
in the midst of a terrible storm and all sorts of

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:54.859
Danger that is imminent and they were not sure that they would survive in the angel

00:15:54.859 --> 00:16:01.119
The Lord came and spoke to to Paul and Paul says this in Acts 27 in verse number 25

00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:04.619
He says wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I

00:16:05.419 --> 00:16:09.579
Believe God. What does he say that it shall be?

00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:13.139
Even as it was told me

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:20.179
Notice that word believe he used the word persuaded in 2nd Timothy 1 in verse number 12

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.739
He uses the word believe in Acts 27 in verse number 25

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:31.499
It's interesting that Hebrews 1039 when he says that we are of them that believe is that same word that we saw?

00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:39.339
That we're referencing here. But the thing that's interesting is that the word persuaded and the word believe they are not the same word

00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:46.859
Obviously, they are synonymous one with another but the interesting thing is you dig in and begin to study is that both of those words?

00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:52.779
Have the same root word and it is the root word that is translated believe in Hebrews 1039

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:59.099
But is the root word that is translated almost 240 times in our English New Testament faith

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:02.459
What is faith it's being persuaded

00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:04.859
What is faith it's believing

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:12.339
Think about Paul in that situation in Acts 27 in verse number 25 if you're familiar with go with what's going on in Acts 27

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.659
Paul had actually told them not to set sail

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:20.979
But yet they went and they sailed anyway, they get in the midst of your Euclidean and all that storm

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:27.619
They did not see stars for days. And I mean they were fearful for their lives and these are professionals

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.619
We

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:36.739
Find that the Lord allowed for the Angel of God to come and to speak to Paul and he says in the midst

00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:39.419
there's 276 people on that ship and

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:44.139
He says I believe God. Can you see the confidence of Paul?

00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:49.659
Standing up. I mean in the midst of all of that turmoil in the midst of that storm

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:56.059
It's raging and the people they're they're concerned for their lives and he stands up with

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.619
Confidence in faith

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.939
believing

00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:05.499
Why because God said it it's gonna be as he said

00:18:05.499 --> 00:18:11.979
I believe God a word that we often use that would be helpful for us to understand what this

00:18:13.139 --> 00:18:15.259
Explanation of faith is that of trust?

00:18:17.099 --> 00:18:19.099
Trusting God I

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:25.659
Believe this this morning that each of us could say similar to what the disciples said in Luke 17

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:28.619
increase our faith

00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:31.219
increase our faith

00:18:31.499 --> 00:18:36.099
If you want your faith to be increased you must get into the Word of God

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:41.019
Not only must you get into the Word of God, but you must exercise faith

00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:44.940
many have likened faith to a muscle and

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:52.500
As you exercise faith and you see God do what only God can do and you prove him you take him at his word

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.539
And you see God what man how that increases your faith

00:18:56.419 --> 00:18:58.699
you think about the disciples and as they

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:05.619
Journeyed along the the road with the Lord Jesus Christ and and you find that many times they saw great miracles

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:10.179
But then they face some type of difficulty and he says how is it that you do not understand?

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:15.759
How is it that you do not remember? What were all of those things? They were faith builders

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.459
Jesus was demonstrating his power and he was showing them what he was able to do and in our lives this morning

00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:29.299
God has demonstrated his power and he's allowed us to see some wonderful things that would cause our faith

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.859
to be increased

00:19:33.459 --> 00:19:35.459
We see the

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:39.579
Fact that faith is explained notice number two faith is exercised

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:45.099
We look at these next two verses. I want you to notice in verse number two

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:50.019
It really is a summary verse. It says for by it the elders

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:53.299
Obtained a good report

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:56.099
For by it by what by faith

00:19:56.859 --> 00:20:00.000
We understand that verse number six says but without faith

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.579
it is impossible to please Him.

00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:03.960
For he that cometh to God

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.579
must believe that He is,

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.280
and that He is a rewarder of them

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.720
that diligently seek Him."

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.560
Those who have gone before us,

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.260
those that are referenced in Hebrews 11,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.440
and obviously many more

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.159
as you get down to the end,

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:20.079
you find that he begins to just

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:23.000
very broadly describe some folks

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.299
that have gone before us.

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:25.559
Some are mentioned by name,

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.659
but then some are just kind of referenced

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.600
as to some of the events that took place

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.319
that transpired in their lifetime.

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:33.740
And he says, those that have gone before us,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.119
by it, thy faith, the elders,

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:37.659
those that have gone before us,

00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:38.580
look what it says.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.240
They obtained a good report.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.759
Their testimony of faith.

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.840
I believe this morning that we could say

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.000
appropriately from what we understand

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.500
in Hebrews 11,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.360
that they pleased the Lord

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.080
and they received His approval.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.340
That's the idea of obtaining a good report

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.840
is to have the approval of.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.480
And we see here that these

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.900
that have gone before us, why?

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.199
Because they live by it, by faith.

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:13.599
See, God has designed it so

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:16.639
that His people are to live by faith.

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:19.099
Not by sight.

00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:24.080
Many times, we prefer to live by sight.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.839
God, just show me how you're going to do it

00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:28.940
and then I'll jump in.

00:21:28.959 --> 00:21:30.839
God says, I want you to believe Me.

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:33.760
I want you to believe that I'll do it.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.139
And see, when we think about faith,

00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:38.959
we must understand that as I mentioned

00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:40.760
in the first point this morning,

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.199
what faith is,

00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:44.300
that the object of our faith

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.099
is of great importance.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:49.319
The object of our faith is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:52.720
God Himself. The Word of God.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.120
And because He is the object of our faith,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.980
and it's not that blind faith

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.800
that we're just kind of taking a step

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.860
and just blindly... no, no.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.360
We're trusting what God has said.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.860
That God will not fail us.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.779
That God will do what He said He will do.

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.360
That He's able to do

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.020
exceeding abundantly above all

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.820
that we ask or think.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.720
And we find here that these

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.619
that will be mentioned later

00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:21.199
throughout Hebrews 11,

00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:23.720
that these, they exercise faith

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.660
and because of their exercising of faith,

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.779
they receive the approval of God,

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:31.940
they please the Lord.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.940
This morning,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.500
I don't think any of us would say,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.600
well, I'm not interested in pleasing God.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.179
That would be a really foolish thing to say,

00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:42.979
don't you agree?

00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:44.220
I believe this morning

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.059
that if we were to one by one go around,

00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:49.380
if we had some means of speaking

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.259
to each individual that's watching

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:52.860
via live stream this morning,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.119
and we were able to contact each one individually

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.880
and say, do you want to please God?

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.080
I think that we'd have a very high percentage,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.720
if not 100%, I mean way up there

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.160
that would answer, yes, I want to please God.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.000
Live by faith.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.899
Because without it, it's impossible to please Him.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:17.119
And the elders that are referenced here

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:18.559
in verse number two

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:21.740
that will have the opportunity to see a sampling

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:24.360
that will follow throughout the remainder of the chapter,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.800
they lived by faith and thus pleased God

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.679
and obtained His approval.

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:33.559
I want you to notice in verse number three,

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.759
a very interesting verse.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:38.000
The Bible says, through faith,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.800
what's that next word?

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.440
We.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.600
Through faith, we understand

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.080
that the worlds were framed by the Word of God

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.320
so that things which are seen

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.619
were not made of things which do appear.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.759
The reason why I believe that this is of interest

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:55.919
is because the majority of the text of Scripture

00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:56.960
that is before us

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.960
references individuals by name who exercise faith.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.679
By faith, right?

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:05.800
We go through it and we can see

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.479
that by faith, Abel, in verse four.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.320
By faith, Enoch, in verse number five.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.199
By faith, Noah.

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:11.160
By faith, Abraham.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.979
By faith, Sarah.

00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:13.199
I mean, you go through the passage

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:15.000
and you see all of these individuals,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.440
but in verse number three,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.320
it says, through faith, we understand.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.500
There was an understanding that the writer of Hebrews

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.779
is expressing to the recipients

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:30.739
and including the recipients in this very truth

00:24:30.739 --> 00:24:32.940
that is before us in verse number three.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.619
There was an understanding that they had

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:37.739
and the understanding that they had

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:40.459
was with regard to creation.

00:24:40.459 --> 00:24:42.279
Now, I understand that verse number three,

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:43.260
there are some that will say,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.579
well, the word worlds doesn't really mean

00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:46.899
universe or creation.

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:48.779
It means ages or eternity.

00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:50.100
The fact of the matter is that

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:52.079
the word that is used there, worlds,

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:54.839
can and does, in some references,

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:57.600
refer to ages and eternity,

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.079
but it also refers to the universe.

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:02.440
And how is it that we determine what it is

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.160
that is being referenced is through the context

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.679
of what we find in the Word of God.

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:11.119
We interpret Scripture contextually.

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:14.920
And as we understand the proper interpretation of Scripture,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.799
I believe this morning that it is abundantly clear

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.779
that what is in view here is that of creation.

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:23.179
Notice what he says.

00:25:23.179 --> 00:25:27.619
Through faith, we, again, using that plural sense

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:32.619
of including the recipients of the book of Hebrews,

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.119
we understand something.

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.420
What is it that we understand?

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:41.420
We understand the worlds were framed by the Word of God.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.579
The worlds were framed by the Word of God.

00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:46.779
You understand this morning,

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:49.359
if you were to read Genesis chapter number one,

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:51.519
that you'll see this phrase repeated,

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:56.519
God said, God said, and it was done.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.200
God said, and it was done.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.279
And you see it repeated through Genesis chapter number one,

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.959
and you have the understanding that as you read

00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:08.559
through Genesis chapter number one

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:13.000
that God has spoken all things into existence.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.119
It's interesting if you turn over to the book of Psalms

00:26:16.459 --> 00:26:19.859
and look, if you will, very quickly at Psalm 32

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:23.940
and notice what is said here, excuse me, Psalm 33.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.380
And I want you to notice what the Lord gives us here

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.700
in this particular passage of Scripture

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.940
with regard to the creation.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.739
Again, I mentioned already that in Genesis chapter number one

00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:37.500
and when we studied this weeks, months ago,

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.420
through our study of the book of Genesis,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.500
I referenced, if you were here as part of that study,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.940
I encourage you to underline where it says,

00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:48.679
God said, and then underline where it says, it was so.

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:51.399
Because God said, and it happened.

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:54.799
Here in Psalm 33, notice what the Bible says

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.380
in verse number one, rejoice in the Lord,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.839
O you righteous, for praise is comely for the upright.

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.959
He's speaking about praising and worshiping the Lord

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:06.839
and how appropriate that is.

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:08.600
Skip down and look at verse number five.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.720
He loveth righteousness and judgment.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.640
The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.500
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.899
And all the host of them, by the breath of his mouth,

00:27:24.899 --> 00:27:28.339
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as in heap.

00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:31.339
He layeth up the depth in storehouses.

00:27:31.339 --> 00:27:33.220
Let all the earth fear the Lord.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.739
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:42.739
Notice verse number nine, for he spake and it was done.

00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:47.500
He commanded and it stood fast.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.940
Isn't that awesome?

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.980
That's our God.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.500
He is the Creator.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.859
We understand this morning that the subject matter

00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:57.059
of creation is under great attack.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:59.500
We understand this morning that our school systems

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.839
have introduced for generations now other theories

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:05.579
with regard to the origin of mankind

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:07.899
and the origin of the universe.

00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:10.700
I read a study not long ago where they changed

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.500
the timing of the age of the earth

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.239
and they had discrepancies between the two groups

00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:19.299
of people that were acknowledging the ages

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.799
and the different things that they did

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.839
in order to determine and they were different

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:24.279
by billions of years and I'm like,

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:26.839
man, we're only talking about thousands of years

00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:28.920
that it even existed, amen?

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.799
But the reality is that what we have to understand

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.679
is that even in their understanding,

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:39.960
even in what they would propagate of evolution

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:44.979
or whatever it is that they would begin to teach,

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:49.059
that they are also exercising some level of faith in that.

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:53.140
They're exercising faith.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.059
I'd much rather exercise faith than the one that was there

00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:59.059
that told us what he did, amen?

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:00.979
He said, here's how it happened, here's what I did.

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:03.299
I said and it was so.

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:05.299
That's the power of God.

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:07.419
See, here's the thing that we must understand

00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:09.820
that when a professor, a school teacher,

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:13.599
no matter what year of schooling they're teaching,

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:15.479
no matter where they find themselves,

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.619
those that would profess to be scientists,

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:21.479
when they begin to teach on the subject matter

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:23.739
of creation or evolution,

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:27.159
they become a philosopher more than a professor

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:30.760
and they're really beginning to try to give

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.280
their perspective, their ideologies and all of that

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.099
and you understand in Romans chapter number one

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:40.159
that the whole of the matter

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:43.940
is that they do not want to acknowledge that there's a God.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.919
Because if you acknowledge there's an existence of God,

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:51.679
then you become accountable to God.

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:52.520
So what do we do?

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.340
What do they do?

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.000
Not what do we do, what do they do?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.960
They want to remove God.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.919
Because if they can remove God,

00:29:58.919 --> 00:30:00.520
then they are not accountable.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.480
You're accountable.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.800
Can I tell you this morning?

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.080
They can try to remove God

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.520
until the stars fall

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.360
or whatever expression you want to use.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.880
You're never going to do it.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.040
And you still are accountable.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.360
Amen?

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.040
I told someone recently

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.400
as I referenced the truth

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.840
in Philippians 3

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.040
where the Word of God says

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.520
that every tongue shall confess.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.160
Right? Every knee is going to bow.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.920
Every tongue is going to confess

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.360
that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.760
And I said to the individual,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.880
it's not a matter of if.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.760
It will happen.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.920
It's a matter of when.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.880
And when makes all the difference.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.920
This side of death,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.240
you confess that Jesus is Lord

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.400
and your eternal destiny will be heaven.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.440
You acknowledge that Jesus is the Son of God.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.480
That He is the only Savior.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.800
That He bled and died to pay for your sin

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.920
because you could not pay for it yourself.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.680
And you acknowledge that He died,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.560
He was buried, He rose in victory.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.000
And you exercise faith in that truth

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.080
that He's given to us

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.240
and you're born again.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.120
You're regenerated.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.360
Heaven is your home

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.640
based upon the authority of the Word of God.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.960
Someone said to me recently,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.120
well, that's up to God.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.120
No, it's not up to God.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.560
What they meant was that God

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.160
just arbitrarily chooses.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.400
No, no, God's given to us

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.520
the truth of His Word

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.040
with regard to salvation.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.960
And He said,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.960
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.000
shall be saved.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.960
He's not willing that any should perish,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.760
but that all should come to repentance.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.440
No one can really know

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.040
is what the person said.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.240
And I said, well, that's interesting

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.000
because the Apostle Paul often said

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.960
how that he had a desire to go

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.800
to be with his Savior.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.160
You can look in Philippians 1.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.360
You can look as he's speaking to the church in Corinth

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.520
in 2 Corinthians where he says

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.040
to be absent from the body

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.680
is to be present with the Lord.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.480
He says to the believers in Philippi,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.520
I am in a straight betwixt two,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.360
having a desire to depart to be with Christ,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.800
which is far better.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.160
For I am now ready to be offered.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.200
The time of my departure is at hand.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.680
In 2 Timothy 4.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.040
Why would a man say that

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.600
if he did not have confidence

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.760
in what God said?

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.760
The lost man is fearful to die.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.920
But Hebrews, as we've studied early on

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.920
in this book,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.800
we find that the book of Hebrews

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.800
in the second chapter tells us

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.640
that because Jesus destroyed

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.400
and what He did on the cross of Calvary

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.120
in destroying the works of the enemy,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.240
that we find that He delivered us

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.040
from the fear of death.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.680
What a joy.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.440
We think about this truth

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.520
of what we find in Hebrews 11

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.680
in verse 3 with regard to creation.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.960
It's under attack.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.200
And we see those that would philosophize

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.400
and those that would give their ideologies.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.080
And this morning, we understand

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.680
that here the writer of Hebrews

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.360
is saying to these Jewish believers,

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.360
through faith we understand

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.200
that the worlds were framed

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.560
by the Word of God.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
We mentioned that.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.120
We saw that in Genesis 1

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.800
in Psalm 33.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.360
He spake and it was done.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.240
What a joy to understand

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.920
the power of God's Word.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.320
You understand this morning

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.760
that there's evidence of design

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.560
everywhere in the universe.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.560
And design demands a designer.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.280
Amen?

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.680
Lord willing, we're going to build a parsonage.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.320
I'm pretty confident that they're not

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320
going to come out here

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320
and deliver all the materials

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.160
and set some type of TNT

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.880
and blow it up and it's going to form a house.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.160
No, there are architects

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.640
that have designed the house.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640
There are particular materials

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.720
that need to come.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.320
There are laborers that have skill

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320
in certain areas,

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.560
and they're going to come in

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.400
and they're going to do the work.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.960
A design demands a designer.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.160
I know that we typically,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160
most of us today,

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.240
we don't have old-time kind of watches

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.080
with all of the intricacies

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.920
of those that were watchmakers years ago.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.600
Many of us have various types of watches today.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.640
But you think about those old-time watches

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.320
and all of the mechanics that were in there,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.400
and you think about the way

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.920
in which someone had to design all of that.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.080
It didn't just happen.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080
You look at the universe.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.440
And here, Hebrews is saying through faith we.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.200
It is faith that helps us

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.400
to have this understanding.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.760
Remember, he says that faith

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.600
is the substance of things hoped for,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.040
the evidence of things not seen.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.640
And we're taking God at His Word.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.560
We're believing what God says.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.840
We look at the latter part of v. 3.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.480
It says, so that things which are seen

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.840
are not made of things which do appear.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.080
What a powerful truth that is given to us here.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.560
Really, many principles of atomic physics

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.120
could be discussed from the latter phrase

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.960
of v. 3 here in Hebrews 11.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.560
And they're clearly in view

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.760
and you begin to understand

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.080
the way in which God made everything.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.480
He spoke it into existence.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.360
And at the center of it all is His energy.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.080
He's keeping it all together.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.360
We mentioned as we started studying this book

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.120
back in Hebrews 1,

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.680
and we began to understand

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.080
how through not only the creation,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.080
but through His power,

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.360
how He holds all things together.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.680
It is His power.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.120
What a joy.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.360
I want to take a journey

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.760
through the Scriptures this morning

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.160
and help us understand this phrase

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.520
through faith we understand.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.760
And again, I believe that the Jewish believers

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.160
that are being written to here

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.320
are understanding the truth of creation

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.520
and thus the word is used through faith.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.320
We understand this.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.480
But I want you to just go with me

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.360
throughout the Scriptures.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.400
Go all the way back, if you will,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.680
to the book of Exodus 20.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.520
Now we understand,

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.520
I don't think we need to go there

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.400
and understand that Adam understood creation.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.240
Amen?

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.160
He was created by God.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.400
He walked in the garden.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.120
I mean, we understand that Noah, no doubt,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.920
had an understanding of creation.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.640
And we look at those things

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.760
and we understand those things

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.640
in the book of Genesis.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.840
Look at Exodus 20, if you will.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.080
And I want to share with you

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.400
that Moses understood the truth of creation.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.120
He understood that God created.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.320
In Exodus 20, in verse 11,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.000
right in the midst of the passage

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.240
dealing with the Ten Commandments,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.160
the Bible says,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.600
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.520
the sea, and all that in them is,

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.760
and rested the seventh day.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.840
Wherefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.120
and hallowed it.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.960
See, we look here and we see

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.800
that Moses had an understanding of creation.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.640
He had an understanding

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.400
that God created all things in six days,

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.680
and then he rested on the seventh day.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.480
And obviously, the model that is given here

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.240
in the previous verse of Scripture

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.760
is with regard to the Sabbath.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.840
And God used that creation week

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.400
as a model for how the nation of Israel

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.800
would understand their week

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.720
and the Sabbath and so on and so forth.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.320
But we see here that Moses understood creation.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.000
Turn to the book of Job, if you will,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.680
in Job chapter number 38.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.600
And we're gonna go backwards here.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.440
We're gonna go forward

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.760
and then we're gonna go backwards.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.040
I apologize for that,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.080
but go over to Job 38.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.040
And let me show you here,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.440
Job 38.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.400
We understand that as we go through the book of Job

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.760
and begin to study,

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.960
and the first couple of chapters

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.520
dealing with all the hardship that Job endured,

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.600
and then of course his miserable comforters,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.840
also known as friends,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.960
come to discuss many things with him.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.360
And then God speaks,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.440
and He speaks here in chapter 38.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.520
The Bible says this,

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.680
then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.040
and said,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.600
Who is this that darkeneth counsel

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.880
by words without knowledge?

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.680
Gird up now thy loins like a man,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680
for I will demand of thee

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.360
and answer thou me.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.360
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.560
Declare, if thou hast understanding.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.240
What's God revealing to Job?

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.400
He's the creator.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.200
Amen?

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.920
Job understood.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.800
Job had an understanding of creation.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.320
I think about David.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.239
You don't need to turn there,

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:37.880
but in Psalm 19 and verse number one,

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.000
what is David saying?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.800
The heavens declare the glory of God.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.200
The firmament showeth forth his handiwork.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.760
We've been singing our theme song

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.920
for the last couple of months

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.160
from Psalm 121, verses one and two.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.840
It is not a psalm that is ascribed to David,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.160
but we find it in that psalm.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.760
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.800
from whence cometh my help.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.400
My help cometh from the Lord,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.239
which made heaven and earth.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.080
We find that Hezekiah turned back,

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.000
if you will, to 2 Kings 19.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.679
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture

00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:14.720
and the account of what happens to Judah

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.239
during this particular time.

00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:19.400
And the Assyrians had already taken captive Israel,

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.400
the world power at that time, Assyria,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.600
and all that they're doing

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.200
and all the lands and people

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.320
that they're conquering.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.760
And they come to Judah,

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.440
and Hezekiah is the king of Judah.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.160
Hezekiah was a good king.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.480
They'd experienced revival,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.920
and we find that Hezekiah here

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.840
in 2 Kings 19 after Sennacherib

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.040
sends Rabshakeh and all that happens

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.480
and all that is threatened,

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.360
we find that the Bible tells us

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.119
that Hezekiah prays.

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:51.239
And I want you to notice what Hezekiah prayed

00:39:51.239 --> 00:39:53.559
in 2 Kings 19 and verse 15.

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:58.000
And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.480
O Lord God of Israel,

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.679
which made heaven and earth,

00:40:02.679 --> 00:40:04.880
which made heaven and earth,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.080
which made heaven and earth,

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.360
which dwellest between the cherubims,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.400
thou art the God, even Thou alone,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.000
of all the kingdoms of the earth.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.800
Thou hast made heaven and earth."

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.740
Hezekiah understood that God's the Creator.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.080
Look over in the book of Jeremiah, if you will.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.680
Jeremiah is just a little bit after Hezekiah

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680
from a timeline perspective

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.400
and all that's taking place.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.440
We now know in Jeremiah 32,

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.440
we understand here in Jeremiah

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.760
that the Babylonians are now besieging.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.040
They've laid their troops

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.800
against the nation of Judah.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.920
And we find that Jeremiah in fact

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.640
could look out and he could see

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.160
the Babylonians that are gathered together.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.960
And God had told Jeremiah

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.040
and Jeremiah had faithfully prophesied

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.380
that the Babylonians are going to take you captive.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.540
It's interesting that the king did not believe

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.220
and yet the king came back and said,

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.820
is there any word from the Lord?

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.860
And Jeremiah's like, yeah, the same thing I've been telling you.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.540
Here's what's going to happen.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.140
Jeremiah's told something interesting in Jeremiah 32.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.980
He's told to buy the field.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.060
We don't have time to get into all of it.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.220
It's a fascinating study.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.940
I preached on it several years ago.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.580
But you look at Jeremiah 32

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.100
and you see that he's instructed to buy the field,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.060
yet the nation of Judah is getting ready

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.820
to be carried into captivity.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.460
And God tells him to buy the field

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.700
and we find that he does.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.180
He takes the evidence and he does all of the things

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.700
the way that he's supposed to.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.380
And we come to the prayer of Jeremiah.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.420
It says in v. 16,

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.140
now when I had delivered the evidence

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.460
of the purchase unto Barak the son of Neriah,

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.860
I prayed unto the Lord saying,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.060
O Lord God, behold,

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.300
Thou hast made the heaven and the earth

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.180
by Thy great power and stretched out arm,

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.020
and there is nothing too hard for Thee.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.100
Jeremiah understood that God's the Creator.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.620
We're taking a quick sampling here.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.180
We've seen Moses. We've seen Job.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.340
We've seen David. We've seen Hezekiah.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.660
We've now seen Jeremiah.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.220
Turn to the New Testament if you will.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.300
I want to use the example of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.820
Of course, He knows the truth of creation

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.260
because He's there. He's the Creator. Amen?

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.500
And Matthew 19, notice what He says.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.300
Certainly, there are many references

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.180
we could look to.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.220
We're just going to look at this one this morning.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.540
Here in Matthew 19 in verses four through six,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.700
He's dealing with a subject matter

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.500
where He's being questioned.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.380
Of course, many times when the religious leaders of the day

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.820
would come to question the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.620
they weren't really coming to question Him

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.660
because they wanted to gain knowledge or understanding.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.900
They were coming to question the Lord Jesus Christ

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.420
because they were trying to catch Him

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.060
and they were trying to accuse Him.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.260
And they were coming with the wrong motives.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.700
And here in Matthew 19,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.580
we find that Jesus is answering.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.460
I'm going to pick it up right in verse 4.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.340
It says that He answered and said unto them,

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.420
Have ye not read that He which made them...

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.020
When? At the beginning.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.540
He's the Creator. Right?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.820
He made them at the beginning,

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.860
made them male and female,

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.100
and said, for this cause shall a man leave father and mother

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.540
and shall cleave to his wife,

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.340
and they twain shall be one flesh.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.140
Wherefore they say are no more twain,

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.140
but one flesh.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.700
Therefore God hath joined together,

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.380
let not man put asunder.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.820
Who is He referencing when He's speaking here

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.180
in these verses of Scripture?

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.700
He's speaking about Adam and Eve, right?

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.780
If you go back and you read in Genesis

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.220
and you read the account in chapters 1 and 2,

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.300
you'll read that exactly what the Lord Jesus Christ

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.020
is saying in verse 5.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.140
In fact, in Genesis 2 and verse 24,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.020
it's almost an exact quote.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.940
And He says, have ye not read

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.820
that He which made them in the beginning.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.500
And so this not only helps us to see the creation,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.180
but helps us to see that Adam and Eve,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.380
that's the beginning of creation.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.540
There's not these long periods of time.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.180
And He says that He made them in the beginning.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.460
Notice not only this truth,

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.220
but turn over to the book of Acts, if you will,

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.260
chapter number four,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.860
look at the testimony of the disciples.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.340
We referenced part of this passage

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.820
two Wednesday nights ago

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.780
and dealt with the subject matter

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.580
of that they had been with Jesus.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.740
And after they had gone through the process

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.060
of standing before the religious leaders of the day

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.460
and Peter boldly proclaiming the truth,

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.300
and they were just given instruction

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.940
that they're no longer allowed to speak

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.860
in the name of the Lord, so on and so forth.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.780
And we find that as Peter and John left,

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.260
they were let go according to verse number 23,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.700
that they went to their own company.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.020
And so we see that they're gathered together again.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.940
And I want you to see what they do,

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.140
how they respond to the hardship that they had endured,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.260
to the threats that they had received.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.860
We find that in verse number 24,

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.180
it says, when they heard that,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.380
they lifted up their voice to God.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.300
They began to pray.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.740
Oh, there's such an importance

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.340
that we find throughout the word of God on prayer.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.780
It says that they began to pray with one voice.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.180
It says that lifted up their voice to God with one accord

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.740
and said, look at what they said,

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.740
Lord, thou art God,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.300
which hast made heaven and earth and the sea

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.900
and all that in them is.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:34.420
The disciples believed in creation.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.860
Paul in Acts 17,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:45.460
he's speaking to these that were in Athens,

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.860
a city that is described as being

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.180
wholly given to idolatry.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.340
Paul begins to stand up in the midst of Mars Hill

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.900
and begins to preach a message

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.180
and he says that he's going to make known

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.500
the Lord God Jehovah to them.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.500
See, because they had this altar

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.700
that as he passed by,

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.380
it had this inscription to the unknown God.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.660
And he says, Him declare I unto you.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.540
And notice the first thing that he says

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.540
in Acts 17 and verse number 24,

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.740
God that made the world

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.620
and all things therein,

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.620
seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth,

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.860
dwelleth not in temples made with hands.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.660
Why do we take the time to go through

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.980
all of these references this morning?

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.460
Because the writer of Hebrews,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.060
as we begin this understanding

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.740
of this subject matter of faith,

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.260
he not only explains what faith is,

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.060
but then he shows how faith is exercised.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.900
He's going to give us a sampling

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.660
of a whole host of those that have gone before us

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.020
in the next several verses of Scripture

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.300
here in Hebrews 11,

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.340
and we're going to see how they exercise faith

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.220
in what God did.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.420
But he says in verse number 3,

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.460
through faith we understand

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.740
that the worlds were framed by the Word of God

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.060
so that things which are seen

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.940
were not made of things which do appear.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.460
As I mentioned as we studied the book of Genesis,

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.380
the book of Genesis is foundational.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.740
It's of great importance.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.220
It's under significant attack today.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.860
There are many that would like to attack

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.940
the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.540
and really just tear down the idea of creation.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.020
And the problem is that if you can't believe

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.540
what God said in the first 11 chapters of Genesis,

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.740
how can you believe what God said anywhere else?

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.740
And really, that's the motive

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.700
of these individuals that are attacking

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.900
those 11 chapters is they're seeking

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.540
to destroy the foundation

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.580
and thus destroy the whole.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.020
That's what they want to do.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.860
But we find that the subject matter of creation

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.220
is not simply contained

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.860
within the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.300
The subject matter of creation is found

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.620
throughout the whole of Scripture.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.620
And there are many that have gone before us,

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.500
and I believe that these Jewish believers

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.420
that this book is written to originally,

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.340
that they had the same understanding

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.180
that God is the Creator.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.700
And we believe that through faith.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.780
This morning, now faith is.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.420
We see it explained.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.180
Understand this morning that it's the substance.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.460
It's that proof.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.900
The evidence.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.460
It's the substance of things hoped for.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.060
The evidence of things not seen.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.860
It gives us a confidence and assurance.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.140
We find that it's by faith that we please God

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.980
and we receive His approval,

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.460
for by it, verse 2,

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.500
the elders obtained a good report.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.140
It's through faith that we believe

00:48:43.179 --> 00:48:45.179
that God is the Creator

00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:47.860
and that as we find it in the latter part of the verse,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.940
so that things which are seen

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.940
were not made of things which do appear,

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.059
and how God has created all things

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:56.299
and He's still continuing to sustain

00:48:56.299 --> 00:49:00.059
all things to this very day.

00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:02.140
As we study the rest of chapter 11,

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.619
we're going to see

00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:07.020
how people exercised faith.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.540
We see it briefly in two verses.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.660
Kind of a summary of the whole, if you will.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.940
Then we're going to track individuals.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.020
We're going to see how they lived by faith.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.619
This morning,

00:49:19.619 --> 00:49:22.059
as we embark our journey on Hebrews chapter 11,

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:24.580
and again, many of us are familiar with the passage,

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.299
with this great chapter,

00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:28.179
I wonder this morning,

00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:30.820
if someone were to write about your life,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.860
if God were to write about your life,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.380
what would He say that you did by faith?

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.299
What would He say that you did by faith?

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.059
Because as we study through Hebrews chapter 11,

00:49:43.059 --> 00:49:44.460
we're going to see

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.739
that there's a group of people that believed God.

00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:49.820
And I find as I look throughout the Scriptures

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.940
and I begin to see

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.619
the significance of verse number 3

00:49:54.619 --> 00:49:58.420
right at the front of all of Hebrews chapter 11,

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.179
how important that it is that we understand through faith

00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:04.100
that He is the Creator.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.820
And if we have that faith,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.220
if we understand that,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:13.220
truth by faith how it will impact and influence the the other areas of our

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:20.740
lives listen if God is the creator of all things and he is no doubt the

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:26.980
disciples went to God in prayer the way they did in Acts chapter 4 no doubt has

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:32.500
a kaya prayed to the Lord God creator in 2nd Kings 19 the way that he did

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:36.300
because he understood these as a creator if God spoke all of these things into

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:43.940
existence this army of the Assyrians is no problem for you God since God created

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.340
all things the threat of the Sanhedrin the religious leaders of the day was no

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:54.980
problem for God to deal with this morning we still are numbered with those

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:59.940
that believe that God is the creator and I'm so thankful that he's given us that

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:06.620
truth now faith is and as we go throughout the remainder of chapter 11

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:13.180
will be challenged to see how the people of God exercise faith be challenged in

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:18.340
our own lives how are we exercising faith it boils down to this do we

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:24.540

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:30.780

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.140
assurance of faith of living by faith of being numbered with those that believe

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.700
