1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
this morning, we're just looking at the first two verses,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,320
the verses that we sang this morning for our theme song

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,119
and the song that, the psalm that is the, of course,

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,479
source of our theme for this year.

5
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,440
And this will be an introductory lesson message,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,280
if you will.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,040
And each year, the Lord has given me the opportunity

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,200
and privilege to serve as the pastor here

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,360
at Fellowship Baptist Church.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,260
I have sought Him with regard to an annual theme.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,059
It helps me and I believe it helps our church

12
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,760
to have an annual theme.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
And there've been many years that the annual theme

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,580
has been from a particular book of the Bible,

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,419
as was the case last year.

16
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,939
And walking in the light and I preached through

17
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,500
the book of 1 John on Sunday mornings

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,299
and went through the entire book.

19
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,540
There've been other years that will be more like this year

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,979
where it's more of a topical theme

21
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,740
and great is the Lord will be a topical theme.

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,860
I won't spend the entire year in Psalm 48

23
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,220
and there will be more of a topical theme

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,380
throughout the year with various messages.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,020
I'll get into some of that here in just a moment,

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,139
but let me just quickly review for you.

27
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:07,220
In 2012, I came here in 2011,

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,779
the Lord brought us in August of 2011.

29
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,900
So the first year that we had a church theme was in 2012.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,059
And we had as our theme that year,

31
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:17,459
standing on His promises.

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,339
And I'm so thankful for the promises of God's word.

33
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,580
And of course, that was a topical series

34
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,540
where we looked at just a number of promises

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,819
that are throughout the word of God

36
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,260
and how we can rejoice in them.

37
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,900
They're exceeding great and precious promises.

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,180
In 2013, I preached from the book of Esther.

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,900
Our theme was for such a time as this.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,540
And what a relevant truth from the Old Testament

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,739
book of Esther and God would still use us.

42
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,620
And we're so thankful that He used Esther

43
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,500
and He would use us.

44
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,739
In 2014 was the book of John, he must increase.

45
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,940
And what a joy to be reminded of that truth in John three,

46
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,860
where John the Baptist said he must increase,

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,260
I must decrease.

48
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,500
And we worked throughout the book of John there in 2014.

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,260
In 2015 and 2016, I preached to the book of Acts.

50
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,800
And 2015 was the first half of the book,

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,260
the first 12 chapters,

52
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,179
and it was boldness to speak thy word.

53
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,539
And how we see the early church moving and working

54
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,139
and following the Lord and they had faced persecution

55
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,940
and threat and they prayed,

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,940
not that God would remove the persecution,

57
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,059
not that God would punish the persecutors,

58
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:29,139
but they prayed that God would grant them boldness

59
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,979
to speak His word.

60
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,500
And what a great prayer.

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
And we see that God answered that prayer

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,580
and God gave them boldness and God used them mightily.

63
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,179
The Bible says that they filled Jerusalem

64
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:40,020
with their doctrine.

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,899
The Bible says that they turned the world upside down

66
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:46,979
and what a blessing to see the word of God spread.

67
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,539
And then in 2016, we finished the book of Acts

68
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,580
chapters 13 through 28 and dealt with the statement

69
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,300
that Paul made in Acts 27.

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,940
I believe God and how important it is

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,059
that we have faith in God,

72
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,820
that we believe what God says

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,860
in the midst of that great storm

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,259
and all that was taking place

75
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,100
and all hope that they should be saved was gone.

76
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,960
I mean, they're not seeing the sun or the stars

77
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,820
and moon for days and all hope was gone.

78
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,539
And the Lord sent an angel and spoke to Paul

79
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,699
and Paul stands up with great confidence

80
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,539
and says, I believe God,

81
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:22,580
that it's going to be just as He said it's going to be

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,300
and what a blessing to see the faith

83
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,339
and finish the book of Acts that year.

84
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,779
2017, increase our faith.

85
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,380
And as we dealt with that theme,

86
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,139
we dealt with as we study the word of God,

87
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,940
what in God's word increases our faith?

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,199
So then faith come with my hearing

89
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,779
and hearing by the word of God.

90
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,660
And so we know that God uses His word to increase our faith

91
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,460
and so throughout the year,

92
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,440
we looked at what I referred to as faith builders

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,259
and we looked at how God would take people

94
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,860
and He would use them

95
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,539
and I'm reminded specifically of Gideon.

96
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,979
Remember when God first comes to Gideon

97
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,339
and thou mighty man of valor

98
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:03,139
and Gideon's kind of like, who's he talking to, right?

99
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,619
And God had to give him some faith builders

100
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:10,539
and God blessed and God developed his faith

101
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,539
and God increases our faith.

102
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,740
And throughout that year,

103
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,540
we talked about the fact that if faith is a flower,

104
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,579
then doubt is a weed and we must get the doubt away.

105
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,220
We must trust God, we must have faith.

106
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,579
In 2018, count your blessings.

107
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:28,700
And my goal in that year was to follow the truth

108
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,859
of Psalm 150, that everything that hath breath,

109
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:34,959
that we're to praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord.

110
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,140
And as we count our blessings, name them one by one

111
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,660
and we will rejoice.

112
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,019
As you study Psalm 150,

113
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,940
you'll find that the Psalm speaks about praising God

114
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,100
for his excellent greatness

115
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,779
and then also praising God for his mighty acts.

116
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,100
And we understand as we went throughout 2018

117
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,980
with that theme of count your blessings

118
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,579
that when we learn to rejoice in who God is,

119
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,739
we learn to give thanks for who He is,

120
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:04,540
that we will never lack reason to rejoice.

121
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,559
Why?

122
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,899
God never changes.

123
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,059
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

124
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,260
And so we can sing and we can rejoice that God is holy.

125
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,459
The psalmist, in fact, says that we're to give thanks

126
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,500
at the remembrance of His holiness and we can thank God.

127
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,239
Listen, our life, things can seem to be falling apart,

128
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,239
turmoil all around us, but we can rejoice in who God is

129
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,239
and His person and He's revealed it to us in His word

130
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:32,579
that He has a plan, He has a purpose and how thankful I am.

131
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,140
And of course, we are to thank God

132
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,339
for the things that He does,

133
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,100
but we need to learn to thank God for who He is.

134
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,380
In 2019, the book of Ephesians,

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,019
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might

136
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,519
and how important it is that we put on

137
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,079
the whole armor of God.

138
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,239
We understand that we're engaged in battle.

139
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:52,399
We mentioned in 2019 how there were so many comments

140
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,160
that were going on with regard to various things

141
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,559
taking place in our world and cultural warfare

142
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,679
was something that was spoken often in that particular time.

143
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,619
And I mentioned that we're really,

144
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,079
we are engaged in spiritual warfare

145
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,299
and we must understand that, we must acknowledge that

146
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,260
and we understand that our weapons are not carnal, right?

147
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,700
Our weapons are spiritual and we dealt with

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,100
be strong in the Lord.

149
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,859
2020, what a, thank God for His wisdom.

150
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,540
I never could have known what was gonna happen in 2020

151
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,899
and it was about October 5th or so of 2019

152
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:30,179
that God led me to have as our theme in 2020,

153
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:34,179
looking unto Jesus and to preach to the book of Hebrews.

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,799
And we had little understanding of all

155
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,359
that we were gonna deal with in 2020,

156
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:42,399
but how God just guided and helped us to understand

157
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,679
how we need to keep our eyes on the author

158
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,519
and finisher of our faith.

159
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,519
And what a great book, the book of Hebrews.

160
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,760
2021, complete in Christ, the book of Colossians.

161
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,920
And I'm so thankful that who I am in Christ

162
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,720
is the most important thing.

163
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,480
We talk about who we are and what our identity is

164
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,459
and so on and so forth.

165
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,760
First and foremost, we must understand

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,059
that I am a Christian, I am a believer,

167
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,619
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

168
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,660
And what a blessing to know the Lord.

169
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,500
And then of course, last year, 2022,

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,820
walking in the light, the book of 1 John.

171
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,339
As we deal with this subject of great is the Lord,

172
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,500
I believe that having a theme helps me,

173
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,299
but also helps our church remain focused

174
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,540
throughout the year.

175
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,500
I seek to follow the leadership of the Lord

176
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,899
and there are certain times, of course,

177
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,140
when I do not preach on the particular theme

178
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,500
or through the particular book or a topic

179
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,079
that isn't aligned with the theme

180
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,760
as God would give that leadership.

181
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,940
But it really helps with keeping that focus.

182
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,239
And this year, my desire, and I hope it will be our desire

183
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,440
and we'll see the result of it,

184
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,559
is that we will focus on the greatness of our God.

185
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,399
The word great means to be chief,

186
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,320
to have vast power and excellence, to be supreme.

187
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,000
And we understand that our God is supreme.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,320
Our God is great and the Bible declares His greatness

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,359
throughout the pages of scripture.

190
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,980
And as we begin to think about the sermon series

191
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,339
that we'll have here on Sunday mornings,

192
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,820
really my desire is to have two parts, if you will.

193
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,339
And it's not gonna be 50-50,

194
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,859
it's not gonna be the first half of the year

195
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,100
and the second half of the year.

196
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,059
It's probably gonna be more like 1 3rd and 2 3rds,

197
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,500
but we'll see how it goes as we get through the year.

198
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,059
But really the first focus or emphasis

199
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:27,619
is going to be this, recognizing His greatness.

200
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,980
That we recognize that our God is great.

201
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,820
You see, what leads us to say God is great?

202
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,000
What is it, what is the,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,239
if you say to someone, my God is great,

204
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:41,280
and they say, why do you say that?

205
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,820
What answers do we have?

206
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,479
How is it that we would respond to that inquiry

207
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,320
that someone would make?

208
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,280
And so we must recognize His greatness

209
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,919
through the pages of scripture.

210
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,080
And then the next section, if you will,

211
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,739
the next part of the sermon series

212
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,539
will be dealing with responding to His greatness.

213
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,039
So once I recognize that God is great,

214
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,719
what is my response to that?

215
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:07,159
How do I respond to this understanding

216
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,320
of how great my God is?

217
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,359
And we find this morning that when I see Him

218
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,880
in all of His greatness,

219
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,679
when I see Him for who He really is,

220
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,280
that it will lead me, it should lead me

221
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
to stand in awe of Him.

222
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,780
And as I stand in awe of Him

223
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,520
and I am understanding His greatness,

224
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,380
that will then lead us to seek and desire

225
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,820
to tell others about how great our God is.

226
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,940
Because truly, we have a great God.

227
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,539
And there's a world that does not,

228
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,700
they are unaware of the truth this morning

229
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,580
that I'm speaking of,

230
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,460
the truth that so many of us take for granted

231
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,580
that we know.

232
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,099
If you came in here this morning

233
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,659
before you saw anything with regard to our theme,

234
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,020
and I said to you, is God great?

235
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,299
I am just absolutely convinced in my mind

236
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:00,640
that each and every one of you.

237
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,240
would have said, yes, God is great, we believe that this morning. But I want to dive deeper into

238
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,760
that truth and I want to help myself and help you this morning to respond properly to that

239
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,280
greatness of God. And as we think about the message this morning here from Psalm 48, really,

240
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,480
it's just going to serve really as an introduction to our theme and I trust that we, each of us,

241
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,720
will be eager to behold His greatness. In Psalm 48, in verse number one, the Bible says,

242
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
great is the Lord. I mean, what a proclamation. What a way to just start the Psalm. Great

243
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,440
is the Lord. And it says this, and greatly to be praised. Man, we ought to praise Him greatly. Why?

244
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,640
Because He's great. He is worthy of our praise. In the city of our God, in the mountain of His

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,640
holiness, beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the

246
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,080
north, the city of the great King. This morning, if you're taking notes, number one, recognize

247
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,440
His greatness. Recognize His greatness. Here, we find that the psalmist, it's a psalm that is here

248
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,120
that would, no doubt, have been sang often. And you think about the declaration as we start,

249
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
and really, throughout the Bible, there are many verses of scripture that we will look at

250
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,520
throughout the year that simply declare the greatness of the Lord. Psalms like this that

251
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,160
just start with that great statement, great is the Lord. And we think about the recognition of

252
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,760
His greatness and understand the Bible declares His greatness in His word. Notice, if you will,

253
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,080
what the psalmist says over in Psalm 135. And I want you to see what the psalmist says with regard

254
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,920
to the greatness of God. And when we think about this truth this morning, when we're confronted

255
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,480
with this and recognizing His greatness, I trust that each of us would be able to say with the

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
psalmist what is declared here in Psalm 135. Notice in verse number one, the Bible says,

257
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,840
praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord. Praise Him, O ye servants of the Lord. You

258
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,520
think there's an emphasis on praise? We find, it says in verse two, ye that stand in the house of

259
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,360
the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praises

260
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,880
unto His name, for it is pleasant. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,840
His peculiar treasure. Notice in verse number five what the psalmist says, for I know that the Lord

262
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,880
is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Isn't that a wonderful statement of the psalmist

263
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,280
in Psalm 135 in verse number five? Listen, he doesn't say, I think the Lord is great. He's

264
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:04,880
saying, he's declaring with great confidence that I know that the Lord is great. And how does that

265
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,480
greatness, how does that understanding that the psalmist have, how would it impact his life?

266
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,440
How should it impact our lives when we understand how great our God is? Listen, this morning I think

267
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,920
when we understand how great God is, it's going to have an impact on our prayer life.

268
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Why? Because he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, because he is a

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,480
great God that has all power and all ability, and so understanding, having the knowledge

270
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,840
of the greatness of God will impact our prayer life. It's going to impact the way that we witness,

271
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,520
it's going to impact the way that we live, it's going to impact the way that we praise Him.

272
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,240
And we see this morning that the psalmist says, I know that the Lord is great. It's interesting as

273
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,880
you think about Moses making this statement in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter number three,

274
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,840
if you would turn over and notice what the word of God says here with regard to the testimony

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,200
that is recorded in Deuteronomy chapter number three. Now understand that as we would look at

276
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,240
the word of God and seek to recognize His greatness, that He has declared His greatness in

277
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,960
His word, but I'm also thankful that He has demonstrated His greatness. You know, it's one

278
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,320
thing to declare something, but it's quite another thing to demonstrate something. And we find this

279
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,240
morning that as we study the word of God, just as the case with so many attributes, God declares,

280
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,400
but then also demonstrates. We speak of God being love. Well, God declared His love, for God so loved

281
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,120
the world, but then He demonstrated His love that He gave His only begotten son. And we find that

282
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
throughout the word of God, as we understand, He declares His holiness, but then He demonstrates

283
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,160
that He's holy. And we think about this truth of His greatness, and we think about Moses and this

284
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,120
particular timing of the book of Deuteronomy, preparation for the children of Israel to enter

285
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
into the land. And we come to verse number 22 of chapter three, and the Bible says, you shall not

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,360
fear them, for the Lord your God, He shall fight for you. And I besought the Lord at that time,

287
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:23,520
saying, notice what he says, O Lord God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness

288
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
in thy mighty hand. Now, pause just for a moment. What had Moses seen God do?

289
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:39,680
Ha! I mean, Moses had witnessed the power of God, the greatness of God over and over. We see God

290
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,640
working on the behalf of the children of Israel. We see, of course, the exodus from the Egyptian

291
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:53,040
bondage and all that takes place, and God showing His greatness through the plagues. I mean, Moses

292
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,400
witnessed those things firsthand. He had the opportunity, a front row seat, so to speak,

293
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,200
to see God's greatness being demonstrated. We find that after they had crossed over the Red Sea,

294
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,280
they sang this morning about, He took them through the sea. And you think about standing there at the

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,760
edge of the Red Sea and the Egyptians following in hot pursuit, ready to destroy and overcome.

296
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,280
We find that God said, hey, you're going to go through and raise up that rod, and God parted the

297
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Red Sea. They get to the other side, and then God closes the Red Sea on the Egyptians, who were saved

298
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,640
to go over as well. We find that they get into the land, and they're worshiping there. After they had

299
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,040
crossed over the Red Sea, and they're worshiping the Lord, and they're praising God, but then there's

300
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,320
no water. It's bitter water. It's not drinkable. And they begin to complain, and God works, and

301
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
He tells them to take this timber, this tree, and to put in the water, and He heals the waters.

302
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And then there's no water, and God says, I'll give you water from the rock. And

303
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,840
then there's no food, and He gives manna from, I mean, we could go on and on.

304
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:09,520
We see the power of God, the greatness of God being demonstrated in the life of Moses.

305
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:18,960
But notice what Moses says, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness,

306
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:28,720
and thy mighty hand. As much as Moses had experienced, it was just the start of God

307
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,680
showing how great He really is. That's amazing to me, because as I read all of those things,

308
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,480
and I study all of those things, I'm looking, I'm saying, man, look at how great our God is. Look at

309
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,280
what He's capable of doing, and this is increasing my faith. This is encouraging my walk with God,

310
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,520
and I am so thankful. But Moses says, it's just the start. That's how great our God is.

311
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,760
We find that in chapter 5, notice what the Bible says in verse number 24.

312
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,400
Deuteronomy 5, in verse number 24, Moses, in chapter 5, He called all Israel together,

313
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,800
and He began to give them some instruction, and to help them as He does throughout the book. It

314
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,520
says in verse number 24, And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us His glory and His

315
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,920
greatness. We have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that

316
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,280
God doth talk with man, and He liveth. And I'm so thankful that God would not only declare His

317
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,280
greatness, but demonstrate His greatness. As we begin to think about the greatness of God,

318
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
and recognizing His greatness, and I know I've said this in the past, but it's so

319
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
worthy of repeating in this particular message that we have

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,200
the truth of God's greatness. And the psalmist in Psalm 135 said, I know that the Lord is great.

321
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,200
Moses said, You've just begun to show us how great you really are. And the psalmist says,

322
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
and you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 145, we'll be there in just a little while,

323
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
but in Psalm 145, the Bible says, Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised. And then it

324
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:08,559
says this, His greatness is unsearchable, because we cannot fully comprehend how great our God is.

325
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:15,600
This morning, if we were to take some time individually, and for each of us to try to,

326
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,280
in our own terms, express how great we think God is, and some would stand, perhaps,

327
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,559
and wax eloquent and speak about how great they understand God to be. And as we go through the

328
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,880
room and let each individual person say this morning, and try to articulate and express from

329
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,920
their own heart and their own mind, this is how great God is. This is why I can say that God is

330
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:46,799
great for each and every one of us. It's more. It exceeds. It's higher, because we cannot fully

331
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,920
understand how great our God is. And this morning, we need to recognize His greatness. The psalmist

332
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,559
begins, Great is the Lord. Not only do we recognize His greatness, number two, we rejoice.

333
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,499
in His greatness.

334
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:03,999
Great is the Lord,

335
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:07,719
and greatly to be praised.

336
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,879
Listen, this morning,

337
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,719
when we understand, when we recognize

338
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,339
how great He is,

339
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,399
we ought to rejoice.

340
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,079
That should be our response.

341
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,559
This great God, as we look in Psalm 48,

342
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,839
the end of the chapter in v. 14,

343
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,639
after it goes through all of these

344
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,119
statements with regard to our God

345
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,159
being a refuge and so on and so forth,

346
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,559
He tells us in v. 14,

347
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,919
for this God is our God,

348
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,799
forever and ever.

349
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,239
He will be our guide even unto death.

350
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,359
Now think about that truth.

351
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,199
I know there's some millennial prophecies

352
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,439
with regard to Psalm 48.

353
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,159
I understand that as you study

354
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,399
the beginning of the chapter in particular.

355
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:51,319
But listen, after I'm in the millennium,

356
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,039
there's no death for me.

357
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,759
Amen?

358
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,919
And it says He's going to be our guide

359
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,039
even unto death.

360
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,639
This God is our God,

361
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,519
forever and ever.

362
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,059
I'm thankful that He's gonna guide me

363
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,479
until I take my final breath here upon this earth,

364
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,699
and then I'm gonna be with Him.

365
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,540
To be absent from the body

366
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,919
is to be present with the Lord.

367
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,199
And yes, He has a plan.

368
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,459
There's going to be all those things

369
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:17,360
that happen during the tribulation,

370
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,279
the millennial reign,

371
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,759
but then forever and ever,

372
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,759
He's my God.

373
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,360
This great God that has revealed to us,

374
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,720
that has declared to us His greatness

375
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,399
in His word,

376
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,220
He's demonstrated it,

377
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,059
not only in the pages of scripture,

378
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,040
but I would say this morning,

379
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,099
that He's demonstrated His greatness in our lives.

380
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,239
And as we think about His greatness,

381
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:40,360
and then we respond to that with rejoicing,

382
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,000
because this God is my God.

383
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,699
I'm always encouraged of how personal God is.

384
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,119
You know, there's almost eight billion people

385
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,220
on earth today.

386
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,559
That's a lot of people.

387
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,119
But God is a personal God.

388
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,519
I mean, I study the pages of scripture.

389
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,879
You begin to see how that,

390
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,759
especially we study the miracles

391
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,439
in our adult Sunday school class for almost,

392
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,479
or the family Sunday school class for almost a year,

393
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,959
and how often when we study the life of Christ

394
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,199
and study those miracles,

395
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,800
you will read where the Bible talks about the multitudes,

396
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,839
but then there's a certain man,

397
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,039
there's a certain woman,

398
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:25,639
and there's a multitude of people,

399
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,699
but God's attention is focused on the individual.

400
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,039
And this morning, I'm so thankful

401
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,020
that God is a personal God.

402
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,639
You think about the nature and character of God

403
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,679
that He can listen to each and every one of us

404
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,679
at the same time.

405
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,679
We just all prayed earlier this morning.

406
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,440
We've been doing that for almost a year now,

407
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,739
before every one of our services,

408
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,580
except for Wednesday night,

409
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,039
because prayer's at the end on Wednesday night,

410
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
but I was convicted almost a year ago

411
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,679
that prayer has become bookends in our services.

412
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,759
God, would you bless?

413
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,759
God, thank you for blessing.

414
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,119
And we have made an effort to specifically take time

415
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,080
as a church family to pray about the service

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,119
and what God would do in our hearts.

417
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,759
And as I am praying with Dean on Sunday mornings here

418
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,699
and with Holly on Sunday evenings here,

419
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:21,319
I can hear the mumbling of people praying.

420
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,020
I have no idea what you're saying,

421
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,059
but God does.

422
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,940
You have needs in your heart

423
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,899
that you're expressing to God,

424
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,500
and God hears you.

425
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,339
God knows.

426
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,099
He is a personal God,

427
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:37,380
and this God is our God,

428
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,739
and I'm so thankful.

429
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,419
As I begin to think about that rejoicing in the Lord,

430
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,580
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

431
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,699
Look at Psalm 145.

432
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,940
I told you we'd be there in just a moment.

433
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,259
Look at what the Bible says here in the first three verses.

434
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,259
When we think about this rejoicing,

435
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,339
because of the understanding that we have

436
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,899
that he is great.

437
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,699
In Psalm 145, beginning in verse number one,

438
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,459
notice what the psalmist says.

439
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:04,059
I will extol thee.

440
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,179
Do you see the determined commitment

441
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,599
that the psalmist has

442
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,580
that this is something that I'm going to do

443
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,099
because of what I understand?

444
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,259
He's going to speak about the greatness of God

445
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:16,339
in verse number three,

446
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,980
but you understand that he's saying

447
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,299
this is what I'm going to do.

448
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm going to rejoice.

449
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,139
I will extol thee, my God, O King,

450
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:30,139
and I will bless thy name forever and ever.

451
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,339
If I could just for a moment go back

452
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,859
to what I said with regard to verse 14 of Psalm 48,

453
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,059
that he's my God now, but he's my God forever and ever.

454
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,899
Listen, we will praise him forever in eternity.

455
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,700
We ought to start praising him now.

456
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,540
Preparation for eternity.

457
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,459
Learning to praise God.

458
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:52,059
Because we're going to praise him forever.

459
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,040
And you notice the commitment,

460
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,899
the determined statement of the psalmist.

461
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,339
Notice what he says in verse number two.

462
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,760
Every day will I bless thee,

463
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,519
and I will praise thy name forever and ever.

464
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,260
Is that because David's always going to have good days?

465
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,380
Is that because David says,

466
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,980
listen, everything's always going to be great

467
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,519
because God is my God,

468
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,720
and so I'm going to praise him every day

469
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,700
because he's just going to give me this perfect life

470
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,619
without any problems, no issues, no.

471
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,419
No, you read the life of David.

472
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:25,419
He had plenty of problems.

473
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,980
Plenty of difficulty and adversity.

474
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,139
But he's making this determination, why?

475
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:34,139
Because he understands how great God is.

476
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,380
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

477
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,739
I'm going to rejoice in his greatness.

478
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,679
And he says, every day will I bless thee.

479
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,239
Great is the Lord, verse number three,

480
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,419
and greatly to be praised.

481
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,639
And his greatness is unsearchable.

482
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,720
This morning,

483
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,559
we think about all the things going on in our world.

484
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,959
There's a lot of stuff going on in our world.

485
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,119
A lot of crazy stuff going on in our world.

486
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,919
God is great.

487
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,399
God is great.

488
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:14,399
We cannot lose focus of that fundamental truth

489
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,239
though all the world,

490
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,799
Brother Mershon has said it for years.

491
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,040
I've heard him say it for years.

492
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,079
I talked to him the other night.

493
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,399
He said it again.

494
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,440
Collectively, we're losing our minds as a world.

495
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,880
We really are.

496
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,160
But God is great.

497
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,579
He's still on his throne.

498
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,679
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

499
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,899
He makes no mistakes.

500
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,880
Though the heathen rage and they devise plans, God laughs.

501
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,839
He has all power.

502
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,000
He's in control.

503
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,919
This morning, when the psalmist says,

504
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,359
I'm going to rejoice because I understand how great you are,

505
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,959
it's not because he's expecting

506
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,200
there'll be no problems in his life.

507
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,399
It's because he understands

508
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,559
that even in the midst of those problems,

509
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,899
in the midst of turmoil, God is still great.

510
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,299
I said this last week, two weeks ago, I think.

511
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,480
It's worth repeating.

512
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,799
You know, the world deals with problems as well.

513
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,839
Man that is born of woman, few days and full of trouble.

514
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,919
We got problems.

515
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,760
Amen?

516
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,500
But you understand as a believer, as a child of God,

517
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,480
your outlook when you have those difficulties

518
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,320
is greatly different than the outlook of the world

519
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,660
if you understand the Bible.

520
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,239
Because when you face that difficulty,

521
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,160
you understand that God's allowed it.

522
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,940
Right?

523
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,760
God has a plan.

524
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,040
He is in control.

525
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,320
And we understand that he's, listen, he's a sovereign God.

526
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,519
He's in control of all things.

527
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,639
Whatever he's allowed in my life, he's permitted it,

528
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,799
he's allowed it, and not only has he allowed it,

529
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,260
but he has a purpose in it.

530
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,359
And that purpose may be to develop me.

531
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,139
That purpose, no doubt, is to glorify him.

532
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,959
But God has a purpose in it.

533
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,200
So we begin to live life and we deal with those.

534
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,239
Listen, the world doesn't understand those concepts.

535
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,079
The world doesn't understand that there's a God

536
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,760
who loves them, that has a plan in it,

537
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,540
that has allowed it, that is seeking to develop them,

538
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,040
to grow them, and to glorify himself.

539
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,580
But we, because we have this precious book,

540
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,599
we understand that.

541
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,840
And we can say with Joseph, ye meant it unto evil,

542
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,440
but God meant it unto good.

543
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,559
Because God is sovereign and God has a plan.

544
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,799
You know, there are times in which we can look

545
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,679
at some examples of God delivering

546
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,760
and then we look at some other situations and say,

547
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,159
I wonder why God didn't or doesn't heal that person

548
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,900
or change this circumstance.

549
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,900
Because God is going to use it to bring glory to himself

550
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,039
in a manner in which is far beyond what would happen

551
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,020
if he just dealt with the problem.

552
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,820
I was thinking this morning as I was teaching the lesson

553
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,219
in Sunday school and I kind of ran out of time,

554
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:20,140
but we dealt with the miracle there in Acts 3.

555
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,900
You know, Acts 3 is recorded to take place

556
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,659
just 40 some days after the Lord Jesus Christ

557
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:28,260
ascended or was crucified.

558
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
He ascends to heaven 40 days later

559
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
and then they're there and they wait

560
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,179
for the filling of the spirit, so on and so forth.

561
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,099
So Acts 3 is happening just a short time

562
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:40,179
after the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

563
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,619
This man was above 40 years old.

564
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,960
He was lame from his mother's womb

565
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,260
and they laid him daily at the gate beautiful.

566
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,000
You think Jesus ever went by him?

567
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,580
I think he probably did.

568
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,380
But Jesus never healed him.

569
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,400
Why?

570
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,679
He healed a lot of people.

571
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,599
But He never healed that man.

572
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,439
Maybe because He was going to allow it to happen when it did, because 5,000 people were

573
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,239
going to get saved as a result.

574
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:20,479
Listen, I'm not saying I know the mind of God, specifically as to why, but God did say,

575
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:24,159
let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus, and we have the Word of God.

576
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,999
I'm not trying to pretend this morning that I know exactly why God did or didn't heal

577
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:29,999
that man.

578
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:34,719
I'm just suggesting to you that when we read the whole of Scripture and we see what's happening,

579
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:40,599
that there was a result because of what happened in Acts 3 that perhaps would not have happened

580
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,599
if Jesus would have just healed him on his way in one day.

581
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,239
Our God, listen, He makes no mistakes.

582
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,299
His timing is not always our timing.

583
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,679
His ways are not our ways.

584
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,359
His thoughts are not our thoughts.

585
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,319
He far exceeds us.

586
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,459
He transcends us.

587
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:58,779
We recognize His greatness.

588
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,339
We rejoice in His greatness.

589
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:04,419
Number three, we report His greatness.

590
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,419
We report His greatness.

591
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:06,419
We tell others.

592
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,939
We desire to report, to proclaim, to declare the greatness of God.

593
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,659
We live, I mentioned by way of introduction, that we live in the midst of a generation

594
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:20,079
that are simply unaware of how great our God is.

595
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,939
They have these weird twisted ideas of who God is.

596
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:29,859
They have this idea that is given to them by this culture that we live in, this worldview,

597
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:31,979
these things that are going around you.

598
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:36,019
Obviously, you have people groups within our nation and around the world that would claim

599
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,019
to be atheists.

600
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:41,819
They deny entirely the existence of God, and you have others that have these weird ideas

601
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,579
about who God is, but God has given us His word, and He's told us, He's revealed to us

602
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,699
in the pages of Scripture who He is.

603
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:54,239
We don't rely on the Department of Education.

604
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:57,059
We don't rely on any other department of the government.

605
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:03,619
We don't rely on Hollywood or any other group of people to reveal to us who God is.

606
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:06,779
God has already revealed it to us.

607
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:12,479
For that, I am thankful, by the way, because not your idea of who God is versus your idea

608
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:15,779
of who God is and your idea and your idea, and then let's get together and kind of figure

609
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,739
out, well, which one makes, which one do we like the most?

610
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,179
No, God said, this is who I am.

611
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:25,500
And see, this morning, we need to report.

612
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,539
We need to tell others about how great our God is.

613
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,979
Notice what the psalmist continues to say in Psalm 145.

614
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:36,139
He said this, and His greatness is unsearchable.

615
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,539
He's obviously acknowledged the understanding that God is great because he says in verse

616
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,459
3, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

617
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:50,539
Notice in verse number 4, one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall

618
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:55,899
declare thy mighty acts.

619
00:32:55,899 --> 00:33:01,339
Similar to what we read in Psalm 78, that generational influence and the opportunity

620
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:08,179
that we have to impact a future generation with regard to who God is, and we shall praise

621
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,219
whose works, the works of God.

622
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:12,299
We shall declare His mighty acts.

623
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,299
Notice verse 5.

624
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,299
Notice what the psalmist says.

625
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:20,819
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works.

626
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:22,139
You know, we need to talk about God.

627
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:26,299
It used to be a little song, I don't know, I haven't heard it in years, let's talk about

628
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,299
Jesus.

629
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,379
We start talking about Jesus and start talking about who He is and what He's done and how

630
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,779
He's worked and so on and so forth, and He says, I'm going to speak.

631
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:40,339
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and men

632
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:43,259
shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts.

633
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,339
Notice what He says, I will declare thy greatness.

634
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,939
Isn't that a great statement?

635
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:54,879
It's a statement of commitment.

636
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,899
It's a statement of determination.

637
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:01,659
I will declare thy greatness.

638
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:07,139
He doesn't put any type of parameters on it with regard to, I will declare thy greatness

639
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:09,500
so long as they want to hear it.

640
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,579
I will declare thy greatness if they ask me.

641
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,859
I will declare, no, no, there's no parameter.

642
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,940
He just says, I will declare thy greatness.

643
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,220
Why?

644
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,779
Because it was in Him.

645
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:22,220
He knew.

646
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:30,179
The psalmist knew how great God was, is, and says, I'm going to declare thy greatness.

647
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,179
Why?

648
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:36,259
Because there's another generation that's coming up that needs to know how great God

649
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:39,619
is and there's a generation that's going to follow them and a generation that's going

650
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,539
to follow them.

651
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:47,139
And if we don't declare His greatness, listen, the humanistic worldview is that they want

652
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,660
to deny God so that in a generation or two there will be no more Christianity.

653
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,299
I've read those quotes to you before from this pulpit.

654
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,299
That's their idea.

655
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,299
That's their worldview.

656
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:00,100
That's their goal.

657
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:06,059
So should not we as the people of God that know how great He is say with David, I will

658
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,699
declare thy greatness.

659
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,660
You say, pastor, you know that it's 2023, you know that we live in the midst of people

660
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,619
that don't want to hear it.

661
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,019
God's great.

662
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,179
You ever experienced something that's so great that you just can't help but talk about it?

663
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:21,179
Ribs.

664
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:22,179
Amen.

665
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:27,339
Some of y'all are hungry already, amen.

666
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:32,220
I mean, you get a good something to eat somewhere, a good whatever, Mark's ready for some ribs

667
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,459
evidently because he said ribs, but you tell somebody about, let me tell you about this

668
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:41,059
meal I had, let me tell you about this experience I had, let me tell you about this place, whatever

669
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:42,459
it might be.

670
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:50,100
Listen, none of that even pales in comparison to how great our God is.

671
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,899
I mean, that's a temporary meal that's going to satisfy you for just a little while and

672
00:35:54,899 --> 00:36:01,059
then you're going to have to eat again, right?

673
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,139
Taste and see that the Lord is good, that's what David says, he says the Lord is great.

674
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:14,179
This morning, I hope that throughout this year that we are so consumed with how great

675
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:22,899
our God is that we recognize His greatness and then we respond to His greatness by praising

676
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:33,579
Him and by telling others about Him because it's just so in me of how great my God is

677
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:40,279
that I just have to tell somebody about how great He is.

678
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:45,539
This morning, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

679
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:53,859
I'm so thankful that God has revealed to us, He's declared it in His Word, but He's demonstrating

680
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:56,899
His Word, He's demonstrating it in our own lives.

681
00:36:56,899 --> 00:37:01,899
This morning, we need to rejoice and then we need to report how great our God is.

682
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:02,899
Let's pray together.

683
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,100
Father, we love You.

684
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,699
We thank You for loving us.

685
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:08,820
How we thank You for the Word of God.

686
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,220
We thank You that You're a great God.

687
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,339
There's none like You.

688
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:24,059
I pray that this year, I pray that this morning in this message that we've been encouraged

689
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,380
about how great You are.

690
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:35,100
I pray that we've been challenged to let somebody else know about how great You are.

691
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,100
We thank You for Your great salvation.

692
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:46,059
It's available through the Lord Jesus Christ, the only way for man to be saved.

693
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:50,979
Lord, if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, I pray that today they'd understand

694
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:54,179
their need for Christ.

695
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:58,619
I pray they'd be saved before they leave this place, before they tune off of live stream.

696
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:09,339
Lord, I pray for every child of God that we'd have a renewed view of just how great You

697
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:18,820
are, that we'd have a determined commitment to declare Your greatness, to praise You for

698
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,779
who You are, to talk by glorious power, by mighty acts.

699
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,979
Lord, I pray that in these moments of invitation, as we have opportunity to respond to how Your

700
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:37,380
Spirit has spoken to us through Your Word, I pray, God, that decisions would be made

701
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,820
that would endure, that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ to impact

702
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
eternity.

703
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,580
Move and work as only You can, and we'll give You the honor and glory for it's in Christ's

704
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,419
name we pray.
