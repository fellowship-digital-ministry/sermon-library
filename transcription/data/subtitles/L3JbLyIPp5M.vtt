WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
this morning, we're just looking at the first two verses,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.320
the verses that we sang this morning for our theme song

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.119
and the song that, the psalm that is the, of course,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.479
source of our theme for this year.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.440
And this will be an introductory lesson message,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.280
if you will.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.040
And each year, the Lord has given me the opportunity

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.200
and privilege to serve as the pastor here

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.360
at Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.260
I have sought Him with regard to an annual theme.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.059
It helps me and I believe it helps our church

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.760
to have an annual theme.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200
And there've been many years that the annual theme

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.580
has been from a particular book of the Bible,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.419
as was the case last year.

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:40.939
And walking in the light and I preached through

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:43.500
the book of 1 John on Sunday mornings

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.299
and went through the entire book.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.540
There've been other years that will be more like this year

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.979
where it's more of a topical theme

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.740
and great is the Lord will be a topical theme.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.860
I won't spend the entire year in Psalm 48

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:59.220
and there will be more of a topical theme

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.380
throughout the year with various messages.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.020
I'll get into some of that here in just a moment,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.139
but let me just quickly review for you.

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.220
In 2012, I came here in 2011,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.779
the Lord brought us in August of 2011.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:12.900
So the first year that we had a church theme was in 2012.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.059
And we had as our theme that year,

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:17.459
standing on His promises.

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.339
And I'm so thankful for the promises of God's word.

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.580
And of course, that was a topical series

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.540
where we looked at just a number of promises

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.819
that are throughout the word of God

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.260
and how we can rejoice in them.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.900
They're exceeding great and precious promises.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.180
In 2013, I preached from the book of Esther.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.900
Our theme was for such a time as this.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.540
And what a relevant truth from the Old Testament

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.739
book of Esther and God would still use us.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.620
And we're so thankful that He used Esther

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.500
and He would use us.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.739
In 2014 was the book of John, he must increase.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.940
And what a joy to be reminded of that truth in John three,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.860
where John the Baptist said he must increase,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260
I must decrease.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.500
And we worked throughout the book of John there in 2014.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.260
In 2015 and 2016, I preached to the book of Acts.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.800
And 2015 was the first half of the book,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260
the first 12 chapters,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.179
and it was boldness to speak thy word.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.539
And how we see the early church moving and working

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.139
and following the Lord and they had faced persecution

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.940
and threat and they prayed,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.940
not that God would remove the persecution,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.059
not that God would punish the persecutors,

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:29.139
but they prayed that God would grant them boldness

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.979
to speak His word.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.500
And what a great prayer.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.300
And we see that God answered that prayer

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.580
and God gave them boldness and God used them mightily.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.179
The Bible says that they filled Jerusalem

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:40.020
with their doctrine.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.899
The Bible says that they turned the world upside down

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.979
and what a blessing to see the word of God spread.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.539
And then in 2016, we finished the book of Acts

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.580
chapters 13 through 28 and dealt with the statement

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.300
that Paul made in Acts 27.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.940
I believe God and how important it is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.059
that we have faith in God,

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.820
that we believe what God says

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.860
in the midst of that great storm

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.259
and all that was taking place

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.100
and all hope that they should be saved was gone.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.960
I mean, they're not seeing the sun or the stars

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.820
and moon for days and all hope was gone.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.539
And the Lord sent an angel and spoke to Paul

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.699
and Paul stands up with great confidence

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.539
and says, I believe God,

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.580
that it's going to be just as He said it's going to be

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.300
and what a blessing to see the faith

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.339
and finish the book of Acts that year.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.779
2017, increase our faith.

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.380
And as we dealt with that theme,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.139
we dealt with as we study the word of God,

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.940
what in God's word increases our faith?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.199
So then faith come with my hearing

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.779
and hearing by the word of God.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.660
And so we know that God uses His word to increase our faith

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.460
and so throughout the year,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.440
we looked at what I referred to as faith builders

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.259
and we looked at how God would take people

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:52.860
and He would use them

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.539
and I'm reminded specifically of Gideon.

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.979
Remember when God first comes to Gideon

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.339
and thou mighty man of valor

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.139
and Gideon's kind of like, who's he talking to, right?

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.619
And God had to give him some faith builders

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.539
and God blessed and God developed his faith

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.539
and God increases our faith.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.740
And throughout that year,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.540
we talked about the fact that if faith is a flower,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.579
then doubt is a weed and we must get the doubt away.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.220
We must trust God, we must have faith.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.579
In 2018, count your blessings.

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:28.700
And my goal in that year was to follow the truth

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.859
of Psalm 150, that everything that hath breath,

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:34.959
that we're to praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:38.140
And as we count our blessings, name them one by one

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.660
and we will rejoice.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.019
As you study Psalm 150,

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.940
you'll find that the Psalm speaks about praising God

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.100
for his excellent greatness

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.779
and then also praising God for his mighty acts.

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.100
And we understand as we went throughout 2018

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.980
with that theme of count your blessings

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.579
that when we learn to rejoice in who God is,

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:01.739
we learn to give thanks for who He is,

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:04.540
that we will never lack reason to rejoice.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.559
Why?

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:06.899
God never changes.

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.059
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.260
And so we can sing and we can rejoice that God is holy.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.459
The psalmist, in fact, says that we're to give thanks

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.500
at the remembrance of His holiness and we can thank God.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.239
Listen, our life, things can seem to be falling apart,

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:25.239
turmoil all around us, but we can rejoice in who God is

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.239
and His person and He's revealed it to us in His word

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:32.579
that He has a plan, He has a purpose and how thankful I am.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.140
And of course, we are to thank God

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.339
for the things that He does,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.100
but we need to learn to thank God for who He is.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.380
In 2019, the book of Ephesians,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.019
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:45.519
and how important it is that we put on

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.079
the whole armor of God.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:49.239
We understand that we're engaged in battle.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:52.399
We mentioned in 2019 how there were so many comments

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:55.160
that were going on with regard to various things

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.559
taking place in our world and cultural warfare

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.679
was something that was spoken often in that particular time.

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.619
And I mentioned that we're really,

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.079
we are engaged in spiritual warfare

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.299
and we must understand that, we must acknowledge that

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:12.260
and we understand that our weapons are not carnal, right?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.700
Our weapons are spiritual and we dealt with

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.100
be strong in the Lord.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.859
2020, what a, thank God for His wisdom.

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.540
I never could have known what was gonna happen in 2020

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.899
and it was about October 5th or so of 2019

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.179
that God led me to have as our theme in 2020,

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:34.179
looking unto Jesus and to preach to the book of Hebrews.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.799
And we had little understanding of all

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:38.359
that we were gonna deal with in 2020,

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:42.399
but how God just guided and helped us to understand

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.679
how we need to keep our eyes on the author

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:46.519
and finisher of our faith.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.519
And what a great book, the book of Hebrews.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:52.760
2021, complete in Christ, the book of Colossians.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.920
And I'm so thankful that who I am in Christ

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.720
is the most important thing.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.480
We talk about who we are and what our identity is

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.459
and so on and so forth.

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.760
First and foremost, we must understand

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.059
that I am a Christian, I am a believer,

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.619
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.660
And what a blessing to know the Lord.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.500
And then of course, last year, 2022,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.820
walking in the light, the book of 1 John.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.339
As we deal with this subject of great is the Lord,

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.500
I believe that having a theme helps me,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.299
but also helps our church remain focused

00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:25.540
throughout the year.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.500
I seek to follow the leadership of the Lord

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.899
and there are certain times, of course,

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.140
when I do not preach on the particular theme

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.500
or through the particular book or a topic

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:35.079
that isn't aligned with the theme

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.760
as God would give that leadership.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.940
But it really helps with keeping that focus.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.239
And this year, my desire, and I hope it will be our desire

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:44.440
and we'll see the result of it,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.559
is that we will focus on the greatness of our God.

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.399
The word great means to be chief,

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.320
to have vast power and excellence, to be supreme.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.000
And we understand that our God is supreme.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.320
Our God is great and the Bible declares His greatness

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.359
throughout the pages of scripture.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.980
And as we begin to think about the sermon series

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.339
that we'll have here on Sunday mornings,

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:10.820
really my desire is to have two parts, if you will.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.339
And it's not gonna be 50-50,

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.859
it's not gonna be the first half of the year

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.100
and the second half of the year.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.059
It's probably gonna be more like 1 3rd and 2 3rds,

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:21.500
but we'll see how it goes as we get through the year.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.059
But really the first focus or emphasis

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:27.619
is going to be this, recognizing His greatness.

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:29.980
That we recognize that our God is great.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.820
You see, what leads us to say God is great?

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.000
What is it, what is the,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.239
if you say to someone, my God is great,

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:41.280
and they say, why do you say that?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.820
What answers do we have?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.479
How is it that we would respond to that inquiry

00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:47.320
that someone would make?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.280
And so we must recognize His greatness

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.919
through the pages of scripture.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:54.080
And then the next section, if you will,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.739
the next part of the sermon series

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:59.539
will be dealing with responding to His greatness.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.039
So once I recognize that God is great,

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.719
what is my response to that?

00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:07.159
How do I respond to this understanding

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:09.320
of how great my God is?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.359
And we find this morning that when I see Him

00:09:12.359 --> 00:09:13.880
in all of His greatness,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.679
when I see Him for who He really is,

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:19.280
that it will lead me, it should lead me

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.640
to stand in awe of Him.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.780
And as I stand in awe of Him

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.520
and I am understanding His greatness,

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:32.380
that will then lead us to seek and desire

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.820
to tell others about how great our God is.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.940
Because truly, we have a great God.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.539
And there's a world that does not,

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.700
they are unaware of the truth this morning

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.580
that I'm speaking of,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.460
the truth that so many of us take for granted

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.580
that we know.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.099
If you came in here this morning

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:52.659
before you saw anything with regard to our theme,

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:55.020
and I said to you, is God great?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.299
I am just absolutely convinced in my mind

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.640
that each and every one of you.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:08.240
would have said, yes, God is great, we believe that this morning. But I want to dive deeper into

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:15.760
that truth and I want to help myself and help you this morning to respond properly to that

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.280
greatness of God. And as we think about the message this morning here from Psalm 48, really,

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.480
it's just going to serve really as an introduction to our theme and I trust that we, each of us,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.720
will be eager to behold His greatness. In Psalm 48, in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.000
great is the Lord. I mean, what a proclamation. What a way to just start the Psalm. Great

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:47.440
is the Lord. And it says this, and greatly to be praised. Man, we ought to praise Him greatly. Why?

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:54.640
Because He's great. He is worthy of our praise. In the city of our God, in the mountain of His

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:02.640
holiness, beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:10.080
north, the city of the great King. This morning, if you're taking notes, number one, recognize

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.440
His greatness. Recognize His greatness. Here, we find that the psalmist, it's a psalm that is here

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.120
that would, no doubt, have been sang often. And you think about the declaration as we start,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.200
and really, throughout the Bible, there are many verses of scripture that we will look at

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.520
throughout the year that simply declare the greatness of the Lord. Psalms like this that

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:40.160
just start with that great statement, great is the Lord. And we think about the recognition of

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.760
His greatness and understand the Bible declares His greatness in His word. Notice, if you will,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.080
what the psalmist says over in Psalm 135. And I want you to see what the psalmist says with regard

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.920
to the greatness of God. And when we think about this truth this morning, when we're confronted

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.480
with this and recognizing His greatness, I trust that each of us would be able to say with the

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.760
psalmist what is declared here in Psalm 135. Notice in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.840
praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord. Praise Him, O ye servants of the Lord. You

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.520
think there's an emphasis on praise? We find, it says in verse two, ye that stand in the house of

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.360
the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praises

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.880
unto His name, for it is pleasant. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.840
His peculiar treasure. Notice in verse number five what the psalmist says, for I know that the Lord

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:48.880
is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Isn't that a wonderful statement of the psalmist

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.280
in Psalm 135 in verse number five? Listen, he doesn't say, I think the Lord is great. He's

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:04.880
saying, he's declaring with great confidence that I know that the Lord is great. And how does that

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.480
greatness, how does that understanding that the psalmist have, how would it impact his life?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.440
How should it impact our lives when we understand how great our God is? Listen, this morning I think

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.920
when we understand how great God is, it's going to have an impact on our prayer life.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.000
Why? Because he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, because he is a

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.480
great God that has all power and all ability, and so understanding, having the knowledge

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.840
of the greatness of God will impact our prayer life. It's going to impact the way that we witness,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.520
it's going to impact the way that we live, it's going to impact the way that we praise Him.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:50.240
And we see this morning that the psalmist says, I know that the Lord is great. It's interesting as

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.880
you think about Moses making this statement in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter number three,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.840
if you would turn over and notice what the word of God says here with regard to the testimony

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.200
that is recorded in Deuteronomy chapter number three. Now understand that as we would look at

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.240
the word of God and seek to recognize His greatness, that He has declared His greatness in

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.960
His word, but I'm also thankful that He has demonstrated His greatness. You know, it's one

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.320
thing to declare something, but it's quite another thing to demonstrate something. And we find this

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.240
morning that as we study the word of God, just as the case with so many attributes, God declares,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.400
but then also demonstrates. We speak of God being love. Well, God declared His love, for God so loved

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:45.120
the world, but then He demonstrated His love that He gave His only begotten son. And we find that

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.720
throughout the word of God, as we understand, He declares His holiness, but then He demonstrates

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.160
that He's holy. And we think about this truth of His greatness, and we think about Moses and this

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.120
particular timing of the book of Deuteronomy, preparation for the children of Israel to enter

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.600
into the land. And we come to verse number 22 of chapter three, and the Bible says, you shall not

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.360
fear them, for the Lord your God, He shall fight for you. And I besought the Lord at that time,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:23.520
saying, notice what he says, O Lord God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.360
in thy mighty hand. Now, pause just for a moment. What had Moses seen God do?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:39.680
Ha! I mean, Moses had witnessed the power of God, the greatness of God over and over. We see God

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.640
working on the behalf of the children of Israel. We see, of course, the exodus from the Egyptian

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.040
bondage and all that takes place, and God showing His greatness through the plagues. I mean, Moses

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.400
witnessed those things firsthand. He had the opportunity, a front row seat, so to speak,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:05.200
to see God's greatness being demonstrated. We find that after they had crossed over the Red Sea,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.280
they sang this morning about, He took them through the sea. And you think about standing there at the

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.760
edge of the Red Sea and the Egyptians following in hot pursuit, ready to destroy and overcome.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.280
We find that God said, hey, you're going to go through and raise up that rod, and God parted the

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.280
Red Sea. They get to the other side, and then God closes the Red Sea on the Egyptians, who were saved

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.640
to go over as well. We find that they get into the land, and they're worshiping there. After they had

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.040
crossed over the Red Sea, and they're worshiping the Lord, and they're praising God, but then there's

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.320
no water. It's bitter water. It's not drinkable. And they begin to complain, and God works, and

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.040
He tells them to take this timber, this tree, and to put in the water, and He heals the waters.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.600
And then there's no water, and God says, I'll give you water from the rock. And

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.840
then there's no food, and He gives manna from, I mean, we could go on and on.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.520
We see the power of God, the greatness of God being demonstrated in the life of Moses.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:18.960
But notice what Moses says, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:28.720
and thy mighty hand. As much as Moses had experienced, it was just the start of God

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:35.680
showing how great He really is. That's amazing to me, because as I read all of those things,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.480
and I study all of those things, I'm looking, I'm saying, man, look at how great our God is. Look at

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.280
what He's capable of doing, and this is increasing my faith. This is encouraging my walk with God,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.520
and I am so thankful. But Moses says, it's just the start. That's how great our God is.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.760
We find that in chapter 5, notice what the Bible says in verse number 24.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.400
Deuteronomy 5, in verse number 24, Moses, in chapter 5, He called all Israel together,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.800
and He began to give them some instruction, and to help them as He does throughout the book. It

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.520
says in verse number 24, And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us His glory and His

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.920
greatness. We have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:27.280
God doth talk with man, and He liveth. And I'm so thankful that God would not only declare His

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.280
greatness, but demonstrate His greatness. As we begin to think about the greatness of God,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.799
and recognizing His greatness, and I know I've said this in the past, but it's so

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.559
worthy of repeating in this particular message that we have

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.200
the truth of God's greatness. And the psalmist in Psalm 135 said, I know that the Lord is great.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.200
Moses said, You've just begun to show us how great you really are. And the psalmist says,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.400
and you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 145, we'll be there in just a little while,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.320
but in Psalm 145, the Bible says, Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised. And then it

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:08.559
says this, His greatness is unsearchable, because we cannot fully comprehend how great our God is.

00:19:10.239 --> 00:19:15.600
This morning, if we were to take some time individually, and for each of us to try to,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.280
in our own terms, express how great we think God is, and some would stand, perhaps,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.559
and wax eloquent and speak about how great they understand God to be. And as we go through the

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:32.880
room and let each individual person say this morning, and try to articulate and express from

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.920
their own heart and their own mind, this is how great God is. This is why I can say that God is

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:46.799
great for each and every one of us. It's more. It exceeds. It's higher, because we cannot fully

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:53.920
understand how great our God is. And this morning, we need to recognize His greatness. The psalmist

00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:00.559
begins, Great is the Lord. Not only do we recognize His greatness, number two, we rejoice.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.499
in His greatness.

00:20:02.499 --> 00:20:03.999
Great is the Lord,

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:07.719
and greatly to be praised.

00:20:07.719 --> 00:20:09.879
Listen, this morning,

00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:11.719
when we understand, when we recognize

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.339
how great He is,

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:15.399
we ought to rejoice.

00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:18.079
That should be our response.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:20.559
This great God, as we look in Psalm 48,

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:22.839
the end of the chapter in v. 14,

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:24.639
after it goes through all of these

00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:27.119
statements with regard to our God

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:29.159
being a refuge and so on and so forth,

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:30.559
He tells us in v. 14,

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.919
for this God is our God,

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:34.799
forever and ever.

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:38.239
He will be our guide even unto death.

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:39.359
Now think about that truth.

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:43.199
I know there's some millennial prophecies

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:44.439
with regard to Psalm 48.

00:20:44.439 --> 00:20:46.159
I understand that as you study

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.399
the beginning of the chapter in particular.

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:51.319
But listen, after I'm in the millennium,

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:54.039
there's no death for me.

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:55.759
Amen?

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:56.919
And it says He's going to be our guide

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.039
even unto death.

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:02.639
This God is our God,

00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:04.519
forever and ever.

00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:06.059
I'm thankful that He's gonna guide me

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:08.479
until I take my final breath here upon this earth,

00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:09.699
and then I'm gonna be with Him.

00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:10.540
To be absent from the body

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.919
is to be present with the Lord.

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:13.199
And yes, He has a plan.

00:21:13.199 --> 00:21:14.459
There's going to be all those things

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:17.360
that happen during the tribulation,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.279
the millennial reign,

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.759
but then forever and ever,

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.759
He's my God.

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.360
This great God that has revealed to us,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.720
that has declared to us His greatness

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:28.399
in His word,

00:21:28.399 --> 00:21:29.220
He's demonstrated it,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.059
not only in the pages of scripture,

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.040
but I would say this morning,

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.099
that He's demonstrated His greatness in our lives.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.239
And as we think about His greatness,

00:21:37.239 --> 00:21:40.360
and then we respond to that with rejoicing,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.000
because this God is my God.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.699
I'm always encouraged of how personal God is.

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.119
You know, there's almost eight billion people

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:54.220
on earth today.

00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:56.559
That's a lot of people.

00:21:57.639 --> 00:22:01.119
But God is a personal God.

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:03.519
I mean, I study the pages of scripture.

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:04.879
You begin to see how that,

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:06.759
especially we study the miracles

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:08.439
in our adult Sunday school class for almost,

00:22:08.439 --> 00:22:11.479
or the family Sunday school class for almost a year,

00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:13.959
and how often when we study the life of Christ

00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:15.199
and study those miracles,

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:18.800
you will read where the Bible talks about the multitudes,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.839
but then there's a certain man,

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.039
there's a certain woman,

00:22:23.399 --> 00:22:25.639
and there's a multitude of people,

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:29.699
but God's attention is focused on the individual.

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:32.039
And this morning, I'm so thankful

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:34.020
that God is a personal God.

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:38.639
You think about the nature and character of God

00:22:38.639 --> 00:22:41.679
that He can listen to each and every one of us

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:42.679
at the same time.

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:46.679
We just all prayed earlier this morning.

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:49.440
We've been doing that for almost a year now,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.739
before every one of our services,

00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:51.580
except for Wednesday night,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.039
because prayer's at the end on Wednesday night,

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.440
but I was convicted almost a year ago

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.679
that prayer has become bookends in our services.

00:22:58.679 --> 00:22:59.759
God, would you bless?

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:01.759
God, thank you for blessing.

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.119
And we have made an effort to specifically take time

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:08.080
as a church family to pray about the service

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.119
and what God would do in our hearts.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.759
And as I am praying with Dean on Sunday mornings here

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:17.699
and with Holly on Sunday evenings here,

00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:21.319
I can hear the mumbling of people praying.

00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:23.020
I have no idea what you're saying,

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.059
but God does.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.940
You have needs in your heart

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.899
that you're expressing to God,

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:32.500
and God hears you.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.339
God knows.

00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:35.099
He is a personal God,

00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:37.380
and this God is our God,

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.739
and I'm so thankful.

00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:42.419
As I begin to think about that rejoicing in the Lord,

00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:44.580
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.699
Look at Psalm 145.

00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:46.940
I told you we'd be there in just a moment.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.259
Look at what the Bible says here in the first three verses.

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:52.259
When we think about this rejoicing,

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:55.339
because of the understanding that we have

00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:56.899
that he is great.

00:23:56.899 --> 00:23:59.699
In Psalm 145, beginning in verse number one,

00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:01.459
notice what the psalmist says.

00:24:01.459 --> 00:24:04.059
I will extol thee.

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:07.179
Do you see the determined commitment

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.599
that the psalmist has

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.580
that this is something that I'm going to do

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.099
because of what I understand?

00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:15.259
He's going to speak about the greatness of God

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:16.339
in verse number three,

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:17.980
but you understand that he's saying

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.299
this is what I'm going to do.

00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:21.260
I'm going to rejoice.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.139
I will extol thee, my God, O King,

00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:30.139
and I will bless thy name forever and ever.

00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:32.339
If I could just for a moment go back

00:24:32.339 --> 00:24:34.859
to what I said with regard to verse 14 of Psalm 48,

00:24:34.859 --> 00:24:38.059
that he's my God now, but he's my God forever and ever.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:41.899
Listen, we will praise him forever in eternity.

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:43.700
We ought to start praising him now.

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.540
Preparation for eternity.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.459
Learning to praise God.

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:52.059
Because we're going to praise him forever.

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.040
And you notice the commitment,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.899
the determined statement of the psalmist.

00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:58.339
Notice what he says in verse number two.

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:01.760
Every day will I bless thee,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.519
and I will praise thy name forever and ever.

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:08.260
Is that because David's always going to have good days?

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.380
Is that because David says,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.980
listen, everything's always going to be great

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.519
because God is my God,

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:15.720
and so I'm going to praise him every day

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.700
because he's just going to give me this perfect life

00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:21.619
without any problems, no issues, no.

00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:23.419
No, you read the life of David.

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:25.419
He had plenty of problems.

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:28.980
Plenty of difficulty and adversity.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.139
But he's making this determination, why?

00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:34.139
Because he understands how great God is.

00:25:34.139 --> 00:25:36.380
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.739
I'm going to rejoice in his greatness.

00:25:38.739 --> 00:25:41.679
And he says, every day will I bless thee.

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:45.239
Great is the Lord, verse number three,

00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:48.419
and greatly to be praised.

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:51.639
And his greatness is unsearchable.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.720
This morning,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.559
we think about all the things going on in our world.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:01.959
There's a lot of stuff going on in our world.

00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:04.119
A lot of crazy stuff going on in our world.

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:06.919
God is great.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.399
God is great.

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:14.399
We cannot lose focus of that fundamental truth

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.239
though all the world,

00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:18.799
Brother Mershon has said it for years.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.040
I've heard him say it for years.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.079
I talked to him the other night.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.399
He said it again.

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:26.440
Collectively, we're losing our minds as a world.

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.880
We really are.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.160
But God is great.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.579
He's still on his throne.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:36.679
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:37.899
He makes no mistakes.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:41.880
Though the heathen rage and they devise plans, God laughs.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.839
He has all power.

00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:47.000
He's in control.

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:51.919
This morning, when the psalmist says,

00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:56.359
I'm going to rejoice because I understand how great you are,

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:57.959
it's not because he's expecting

00:26:57.959 --> 00:27:00.200
there'll be no problems in his life.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.399
It's because he understands

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:03.559
that even in the midst of those problems,

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:07.899
in the midst of turmoil, God is still great.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.299
I said this last week, two weeks ago, I think.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.480
It's worth repeating.

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:16.799
You know, the world deals with problems as well.

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:21.839
Man that is born of woman, few days and full of trouble.

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:23.919
We got problems.

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:24.760
Amen?

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:30.500
But you understand as a believer, as a child of God,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.480
your outlook when you have those difficulties

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.320
is greatly different than the outlook of the world

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.660
if you understand the Bible.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.239
Because when you face that difficulty,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.160
you understand that God's allowed it.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.940
Right?

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.760
God has a plan.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.040
He is in control.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.320
And we understand that he's, listen, he's a sovereign God.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.519
He's in control of all things.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:57.639
Whatever he's allowed in my life, he's permitted it,

00:27:57.639 --> 00:27:59.799
he's allowed it, and not only has he allowed it,

00:27:59.799 --> 00:28:02.260
but he has a purpose in it.

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:08.359
And that purpose may be to develop me.

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:12.139
That purpose, no doubt, is to glorify him.

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:14.959
But God has a purpose in it.

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:17.200
So we begin to live life and we deal with those.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.239
Listen, the world doesn't understand those concepts.

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.079
The world doesn't understand that there's a God

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:24.760
who loves them, that has a plan in it,

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.540
that has allowed it, that is seeking to develop them,

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.040
to grow them, and to glorify himself.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.580
But we, because we have this precious book,

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.599
we understand that.

00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:38.840
And we can say with Joseph, ye meant it unto evil,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.440
but God meant it unto good.

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:45.559
Because God is sovereign and God has a plan.

00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:49.799
You know, there are times in which we can look

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:53.679
at some examples of God delivering

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.760
and then we look at some other situations and say,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.159
I wonder why God didn't or doesn't heal that person

00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:00.900
or change this circumstance.

00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:05.900
Because God is going to use it to bring glory to himself

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.039
in a manner in which is far beyond what would happen

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:13.020
if he just dealt with the problem.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.820
I was thinking this morning as I was teaching the lesson

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.219
in Sunday school and I kind of ran out of time,

00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:20.140
but we dealt with the miracle there in Acts 3.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.900
You know, Acts 3 is recorded to take place

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.659
just 40 some days after the Lord Jesus Christ

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:28.260
ascended or was crucified.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.260
He ascends to heaven 40 days later

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.260
and then they're there and they wait

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.179
for the filling of the spirit, so on and so forth.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:36.099
So Acts 3 is happening just a short time

00:29:36.099 --> 00:29:40.179
after the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:42.619
This man was above 40 years old.

00:29:42.619 --> 00:29:44.960
He was lame from his mother's womb

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.260
and they laid him daily at the gate beautiful.

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:50.000
You think Jesus ever went by him?

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.580
I think he probably did.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.380
But Jesus never healed him.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.400
Why?

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.679
He healed a lot of people.

00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:05.599
But He never healed that man.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:10.439
Maybe because He was going to allow it to happen when it did, because 5,000 people were

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:13.239
going to get saved as a result.

00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:20.479
Listen, I'm not saying I know the mind of God, specifically as to why, but God did say,

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:24.159
let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus, and we have the Word of God.

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:28.999
I'm not trying to pretend this morning that I know exactly why God did or didn't heal

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:29.999
that man.

00:30:29.999 --> 00:30:34.719
I'm just suggesting to you that when we read the whole of Scripture and we see what's happening,

00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:40.599
that there was a result because of what happened in Acts 3 that perhaps would not have happened

00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:44.599
if Jesus would have just healed him on his way in one day.

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:47.239
Our God, listen, He makes no mistakes.

00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:49.299
His timing is not always our timing.

00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:50.679
His ways are not our ways.

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:52.359
His thoughts are not our thoughts.

00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:55.319
He far exceeds us.

00:30:55.319 --> 00:30:57.459
He transcends us.

00:30:57.459 --> 00:30:58.779
We recognize His greatness.

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:00.339
We rejoice in His greatness.

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:04.419
Number three, we report His greatness.

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:05.419
We report His greatness.

00:31:05.419 --> 00:31:06.419
We tell others.

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:12.939
We desire to report, to proclaim, to declare the greatness of God.

00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:16.659
We live, I mentioned by way of introduction, that we live in the midst of a generation

00:31:16.659 --> 00:31:20.079
that are simply unaware of how great our God is.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:22.939
They have these weird twisted ideas of who God is.

00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:29.859
They have this idea that is given to them by this culture that we live in, this worldview,

00:31:29.859 --> 00:31:31.979
these things that are going around you.

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:36.019
Obviously, you have people groups within our nation and around the world that would claim

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:37.019
to be atheists.

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:41.819
They deny entirely the existence of God, and you have others that have these weird ideas

00:31:41.819 --> 00:31:46.579
about who God is, but God has given us His word, and He's told us, He's revealed to us

00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:50.699
in the pages of Scripture who He is.

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:54.239
We don't rely on the Department of Education.

00:31:54.239 --> 00:31:57.059
We don't rely on any other department of the government.

00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:03.619
We don't rely on Hollywood or any other group of people to reveal to us who God is.

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:06.779
God has already revealed it to us.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:12.479
For that, I am thankful, by the way, because not your idea of who God is versus your idea

00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:15.779
of who God is and your idea and your idea, and then let's get together and kind of figure

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:18.739
out, well, which one makes, which one do we like the most?

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:22.179
No, God said, this is who I am.

00:32:22.179 --> 00:32:25.500
And see, this morning, we need to report.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.539
We need to tell others about how great our God is.

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:32.979
Notice what the psalmist continues to say in Psalm 145.

00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:36.139
He said this, and His greatness is unsearchable.

00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:39.539
He's obviously acknowledged the understanding that God is great because he says in verse

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:41.459
3, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:50.539
Notice in verse number 4, one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:55.899
declare thy mighty acts.

00:32:55.899 --> 00:33:01.339
Similar to what we read in Psalm 78, that generational influence and the opportunity

00:33:01.339 --> 00:33:08.179
that we have to impact a future generation with regard to who God is, and we shall praise

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:10.219
whose works, the works of God.

00:33:10.219 --> 00:33:12.299
We shall declare His mighty acts.

00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:13.299
Notice verse 5.

00:33:13.299 --> 00:33:14.299
Notice what the psalmist says.

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:20.819
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works.

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:22.139
You know, we need to talk about God.

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:26.299
It used to be a little song, I don't know, I haven't heard it in years, let's talk about

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:27.299
Jesus.

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:32.379
We start talking about Jesus and start talking about who He is and what He's done and how

00:33:32.379 --> 00:33:35.779
He's worked and so on and so forth, and He says, I'm going to speak.

00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:40.339
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and men

00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:43.259
shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts.

00:33:43.259 --> 00:33:48.339
Notice what He says, I will declare thy greatness.

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:51.939
Isn't that a great statement?

00:33:51.939 --> 00:33:54.879
It's a statement of commitment.

00:33:54.879 --> 00:33:56.899
It's a statement of determination.

00:33:56.899 --> 00:34:01.659
I will declare thy greatness.

00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:07.139
He doesn't put any type of parameters on it with regard to, I will declare thy greatness

00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:09.500
so long as they want to hear it.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.579
I will declare thy greatness if they ask me.

00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:13.859
I will declare, no, no, there's no parameter.

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:17.940
He just says, I will declare thy greatness.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.220
Why?

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.779
Because it was in Him.

00:34:20.779 --> 00:34:22.220
He knew.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:30.179
The psalmist knew how great God was, is, and says, I'm going to declare thy greatness.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.179
Why?

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:36.259
Because there's another generation that's coming up that needs to know how great God

00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:39.619
is and there's a generation that's going to follow them and a generation that's going

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.539
to follow them.

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:47.139
And if we don't declare His greatness, listen, the humanistic worldview is that they want

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:51.660
to deny God so that in a generation or two there will be no more Christianity.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.299
I've read those quotes to you before from this pulpit.

00:34:55.299 --> 00:34:56.299
That's their idea.

00:34:56.299 --> 00:34:57.299
That's their worldview.

00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:00.100
That's their goal.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:06.059
So should not we as the people of God that know how great He is say with David, I will

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:08.699
declare thy greatness.

00:35:08.699 --> 00:35:11.660
You say, pastor, you know that it's 2023, you know that we live in the midst of people

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.619
that don't want to hear it.

00:35:13.619 --> 00:35:16.019
God's great.

00:35:16.019 --> 00:35:20.179
You ever experienced something that's so great that you just can't help but talk about it?

00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:21.179
Ribs.

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:22.179
Amen.

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:27.339
Some of y'all are hungry already, amen.

00:35:27.339 --> 00:35:32.220
I mean, you get a good something to eat somewhere, a good whatever, Mark's ready for some ribs

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.459
evidently because he said ribs, but you tell somebody about, let me tell you about this

00:35:37.459 --> 00:35:41.059
meal I had, let me tell you about this experience I had, let me tell you about this place, whatever

00:35:41.059 --> 00:35:42.459
it might be.

00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:50.100
Listen, none of that even pales in comparison to how great our God is.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.899
I mean, that's a temporary meal that's going to satisfy you for just a little while and

00:35:54.899 --> 00:36:01.059
then you're going to have to eat again, right?

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:06.139
Taste and see that the Lord is good, that's what David says, he says the Lord is great.

00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:14.179
This morning, I hope that throughout this year that we are so consumed with how great

00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:22.899
our God is that we recognize His greatness and then we respond to His greatness by praising

00:36:22.899 --> 00:36:33.579
Him and by telling others about Him because it's just so in me of how great my God is

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:40.279
that I just have to tell somebody about how great He is.

00:36:40.279 --> 00:36:45.539
This morning, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:53.859
I'm so thankful that God has revealed to us, He's declared it in His Word, but He's demonstrating

00:36:53.859 --> 00:36:56.899
His Word, He's demonstrating it in our own lives.

00:36:56.899 --> 00:37:01.899
This morning, we need to rejoice and then we need to report how great our God is.

00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:02.899
Let's pray together.

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:04.100
Father, we love You.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.699
We thank You for loving us.

00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:08.820
How we thank You for the Word of God.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.220
We thank You that You're a great God.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.339
There's none like You.

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:24.059
I pray that this year, I pray that this morning in this message that we've been encouraged

00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:26.380
about how great You are.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:35.100
I pray that we've been challenged to let somebody else know about how great You are.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.100
We thank You for Your great salvation.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:46.059
It's available through the Lord Jesus Christ, the only way for man to be saved.

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:50.979
Lord, if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, I pray that today they'd understand

00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:54.179
their need for Christ.

00:37:54.179 --> 00:37:58.619
I pray they'd be saved before they leave this place, before they tune off of live stream.

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:09.339
Lord, I pray for every child of God that we'd have a renewed view of just how great You

00:38:09.339 --> 00:38:18.820
are, that we'd have a determined commitment to declare Your greatness, to praise You for

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:25.779
who You are, to talk by glorious power, by mighty acts.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:31.979
Lord, I pray that in these moments of invitation, as we have opportunity to respond to how Your

00:38:31.979 --> 00:38:37.380
Spirit has spoken to us through Your Word, I pray, God, that decisions would be made

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.820
that would endure, that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ to impact

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.820
eternity.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.580
Move and work as only You can, and we'll give You the honor and glory for it's in Christ's

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.419
name we pray.
