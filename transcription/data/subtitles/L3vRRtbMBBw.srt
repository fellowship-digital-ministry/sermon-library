1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,659
We have not been in the book of Hebrews, but we are planning have been working through the book of Hebrews here in

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:12,800
2020 with our theme being looking unto Jesus. I'm so thankful. I've had so many

3
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,040
opportunities to speak with people during this pandemic

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:22,340
that have been fearful and concerned and all sorts of things and I've been able to share with them how in

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,360
September of

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,000
2019 God led me to this theme

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,479
looking unto Jesus for

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
2020 of course, I had no idea what

9
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:36,720
2020 was going to hold but God did and I've told people this many times

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,520
You've heard me say it even during the services

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,080
We can have the peace of God which passeth all understanding not because we have our head in the sand

12
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:48,400
but because we have our eyes on our Savior and

13
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm so thankful to know that he is in control when it seems like everything is out of control

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,220
It's good to know the one that is in control

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,880
Amen, and what a blessing to know that he sits upon his throne. He rules and reigns. He is the Lord God

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,639
Omnipotent Hebrews chapter number six. We'll be looking at verses 9 through 12

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,160
Hebrews 6 verses 9 through 12. The Bible says this but beloved

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,500
We are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation

19
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,199
Though we thus speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,959
which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,059
Do minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,519
Unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience

23
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:49,800
Inherit the promises you notice in our text of Scripture here in Hebrews 5 verse number 11

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,800
Down through really the entirety of chapter number 6 we've been dealing with this warning passage

25
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,720
we mentioned that the warning passage initially dealt with a a

26
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:05,160
Confronting of those that were being written to they were confronted about what they were confronted about their spiritual immaturity

27
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,880
They had not been growing in the time that you ought to be teachers

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,559
You have need that one teach you is what they were told and so we find that they are confronted about their spiritual

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
immaturity and then they are

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Challenged to go on

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,559
to perfection to grow spiritually to become mature in Christ and what a blessing to understand the

32
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:33,919
Importance of growth as a believer and obviously in the last portion of Hebrews 6 that we studied several weeks ago

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,600
In fact, it was the first Sunday of the month of May

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,839
We dealt with the passage of Scripture of go on to spiritual maturity

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,479
We took several minutes in that message to deal with the use of pronouns

36
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,720
throughout the passage to understand how the

37
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:57,800
text of Scripture was being written and we come to the text that we're dealing with this morning and we find in verse number 9 there's

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
that great conjunction but

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,360
Beloved and so we find that the writer of Hebrews is now

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,839
Addressing this group of people these believers that the warning initially was given to in

41
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,479
chapter number 5 in verses 11 14

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,960
listen a lost person is not challenged with growing spiritually a lost person is challenged with conversion and

43
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:26,320
Then as you're saved you're to go on to spiritual maturity

44
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,139
And so as we look at the text of Scripture that is before us this morning

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,399
I've titled the message from verse number 9 things that accompany

46
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:39,800
Salvation things that accompany salvation

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm mindful of what the Apostle Paul said to the church in Thessalonica and we've often

48
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,119
referenced the church in Thessalonica and we've spoken about the fact that this is a model church a church that was

49
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,919
exhibiting

50
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,919
spiritual character in growing

51
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,419
Paul says this in 1st Thessalonians 1 in verse number 3

52
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,259
Remembering without ceasing

53
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,020
Your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord

54
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,619
Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father as he writes to them in the second epistle again

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:19,859
In chapter 1 in verse number 3. He says we are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is me

56
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,820
Why because that your faith groweth?

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,459
Exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other

58
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,500
Aboundeth do you notice those words as he writes the second epistle? He writes the first letter

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,820
He says I'm thankful for these things. But as he writes the second letter, he notes progress

60
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,940
He notes the fact that he says that you your faith grow with

61
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,500
Exceedingly and then he says of their love that they have one toward another that it aboundeth

62
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:58,059
Those are words that describe progress that describe growth and we'd understand in the Christian life that there ought to be

63
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:03,339
Progress there ought to be growth there ought to be things that accompany

64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,940
salvation number one if you're taking notes notice the evidence of conversion the evidence of conversion the

65
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,019
The writer says but beloved we are persuaded of better things of you

66
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
notice and things

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
that accompany

68
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,899
Salvation the things there's a just a couple that are listed here in in Hebrews chapter number six

69
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,779
But we understand as we study the whole of Scripture that you could certainly develop a more robust

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,179
List of what I often refer to as birthmarks of a believer. There are signs

71
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:48,459
There are evidences of life. In fact, there are evidence of evidences of life in you physically speaking even now

72
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,859
Right, you're sitting up you're breathing your eyes are open most of you

73
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,660
but the reality is there are evidences of life right and so as a

74
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:04,459
Believer there ought to be some birthmarks of the believer. There ought to be some evidences

75
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,299
Some have said this over the years some preachers of yesteryear

76
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:16,820
have noted the truth of the birthmarks of believers in the evidence of conversion and they've often asked this question if

77
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,899
You were charged in a court of law and the crime that you were charged of was being a Christian

78
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:30,540
Would there be enough evidence to convict you? That's a good thought. I like the thought I'm not a lawyer

79
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,540
I don't want to talk to too many more lawyers

80
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:38,459
Except for brother Michael. Amen, but the reality is that we wonder is there the evidence? Is it there?

81
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,000
Does it support the claim see it's easy for somebody to say I'm a Christian

82
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
It's

83
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,239
Another thing to have evidence of conversion

84
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
The Bible tells us in 2nd Corinthians 5 in verse number 17 if any man be in Christ

85
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,519
He is a new creature old things are passed away behold

86
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,160
All things are become new the Bible tells us in 1st Peter 2 in verse number 2 as newborn

87
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:05,000
Babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow

88
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,880
thereby

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,260
And we look at the passage of Scripture and deal with the specific nature of what the

90
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,440
Evidences are that they speak of and he says the things that accompany salvation

91
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,239
Though we thus speak notice in verse number 10 for God is not unrighteous number one to forget your work

92
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,660
And so we notice the evidence of conversion would be their service their work for the Lord now

93
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,899
It's important for us to understand that works cannot save you

94
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,339
It's absolutely impossible

95
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,859
The only thing that can save us is the blood of Jesus Christ his death burial and glorious resurrection

96
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,140
The gospel as we often refer to it, but we understand this morning that our works or our service for Christ

97
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
They reveal our

98
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,100
Position in Christ if you study the book of Ephesians, which we did in 2019 as a church family

99
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,940
I preached the entire book on Sunday mornings through the book of Ephesians

100
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:10,980
And you find that in the first few chapters. In fact, the first three chapters of Ephesians deal with

101
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:18,739
Establishing your position in Christ who we are in Christ these believers that Paul is writing to in Ephesus

102
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,019
he had ministered there and he was

103
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,700
Reminding them of their conversion and reminding them of their position in Christ

104
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,059
He says this in Ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9 for by grace

105
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,820
Are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves?

106
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,500
It is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast

107
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,539
Unless we forget so many people think that Paul and James are contrary one to the other. They actually

108
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:50,700
Work perfect in unity one with the other Paul is dealing with the root of salvation

109
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,140
James is dealing with the fruit of salvation

110
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,500
But you must understand and acknowledge this morning that though the Apostle Paul deals with the root of salvation

111
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,299
He often speaks about the fruit of salvation in the very next verse in Ephesians 2 in verse number 10

112
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
He says for we are

113
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
his workmanship

114
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:18,539
Created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Oh Paul used the word good works

115
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,179
Yeah, but he says that's what that's the evidence of salvation that helps us to understand

116
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,739
And to reveal our position in Christ

117
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:30,859
He says that we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works

118
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,780
What's God hath before ordained that we should walk in?

119
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:41,539
Them it's interesting that in the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians Paul spends much time

120
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,539
Helping to establish their position in Christ

121
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,059
But if you get into chapters 4 5 & 6 you notice on five occasions

122
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,419
What does Paul reference their walk?

123
00:09:54,179 --> 00:10:00,020
Their walk their behavior. I said often as we studied the book of Ephesians in

124
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,920
2019, that as Paul gets into the latter part, the second half of the book of

125
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,680
Ephesians, he's not telling these people, it's important to understand this, two

126
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,080
important truths. He's not telling them, these are the things you do to be saved,

127
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,320
nor is he telling them, these are the things that you do to stay saved. No. He's

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,720
telling them, these are the things that you do because you are saved. These are

129
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,480
the evidences of salvation. Your work in the book of Titus, on a number of

130
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,600
occasions, it's a short letter, just a few chapters, and we find that as

131
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,920
Paul is writing to Titus and he's giving instruction with regard to the work at

132
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,120
Crete and that which Titus was responsible for, you know that on a

133
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,560
number of occasions in that book he references good works? He says this in

134
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Titus 2 in verse number 7, in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works

135
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,160
in doctrine, showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that

136
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,320
cannot be condemned, that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,660
no evil thing to say of you. Remember, we sing the song, there's been a great

138
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,200
change since I've been born again. We sing it with the kids, right? We ought to

139
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,240
sing it as adults. The things I used to say, I don't say them anymore, right? What

140
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,520
does it say here in verse number 8? Sound speech that cannot be condemned. The

141
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,520
things I used to say, I don't say them anymore. The things I used to do, I don't

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,800
do them anymore. The place I used to go, I don't go there anymore. Why?

143
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,480
There's been a great change since I've been born again. Praise the Lord for

144
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,060
conversion. He says a little bit later here in the book of Titus, and look in

145
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,280
verse number 14, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all

146
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,320
iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,440
But you notice in chapter number 3, in verse number 5, that Paul also says, not

148
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,560
by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved

149
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,400
us. There's no contradiction. It's the evidence of salvation, our work, our

150
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,840
service. He will say in verse number 14, nearing the end of the book of Titus of

151
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,320
chapter 3 and verse 14, and let ours also learn to maintain good works for

152
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,720
necessary uses that they be not unfruitful. It's interesting if you were

153
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,240
to read about the seven churches in Asia in Revelation 2 and 3, in each of the

154
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,520
letters that are written to those seven churches, you find that God says

155
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:44,320
through John, I know thy works. I know thy works. Every church that's mentioned in

156
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,160
Revelation 2 and 3, all seven of those churches in Asia, God says, the Lord Jesus

157
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,600
Christ says, I know thy works. Notice what the writer of Hebrews says to these

158
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,400
believers that he's writing to. He says, these things that accompany salvation,

159
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,440
the first one he says, for God is not unrighteous to forget your work. The

160
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,840
first evidence of salvation that is dealt with here in Hebrews 6 is our

161
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,280
service to our God. You know, as a believer, there are many things that

162
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,720
happen at the time of conversion, and most of us, the day in which we got saved,

163
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,720
we probably didn't understand all of those things that happened on that day.

164
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,800
But as we've grown in Christ, we've learned some of those things that

165
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,680
happen. The wonderful truth of conversion and understanding that our

166
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,200
bodies, we're the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in us, right? We've been

167
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,360
indwelled by the Spirit of God which is the proof of our salvation according to

168
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,520
Ephesians 1, and we find that the Bible speaks about the fact that we have been

169
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,440
given gifts, spiritual gifts. Every believer has been equipped by God

170
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:02,280
Almighty with a spiritual gift. Why? For the work, for the work of the ministry.

171
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,240
Paul told the same group of people that we've referenced multiple times here in

172
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,440
the church at Ephesus, he told them in chapter number 4 and verse number 11, and

173
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,520
he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors

174
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,520
and teachers for the perfecting of the saints' notice for the work of the

175
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,840
ministry. Everybody doing their part. We speak about many hands make light work,

176
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,120
but we think about the way in which the Holy Spirit of God has gifted the church,

177
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,400
and we find that God uses the illustration of the human body. I'm

178
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
thankful that I have a right hand and a left hand. My left hand's a little bit

179
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,720
behind because I'm right-handed, and sometimes I say this hand doesn't do what

180
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,840
I want it to do, but I'm really glad I don't have two right hands. Amen? And you

181
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,160
can think about the way that God has designed our bodies, and we

182
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,680
understand the illustration of the body of believers, the church, and how God has

183
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,240
individually gifted every believer. Why? For the work. The purpose of your

184
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,520
spiritual gift is not so you can use it for yourself, it's that you use it in the

185
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,640
church for the glory of God. I often think about the Old Testament

186
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,000
illustration in the book of Exodus. In fact, I'll be looking at Exodus chapter

187
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,120
40 this evening as what I'll be preaching from, but if you look in all of

188
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,880
that passage at the end of the book of Exodus dealing with the construction of

189
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,960
the tabernacle, there's a man by the name of Bezalel, and Bezalel was gifted by

190
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,520
God for all of that work that God had instructed Moses to do. I'll be honest

191
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,440
with you, if I was Moses receiving all of that instruction with all of those

192
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,680
pieces of furniture, it's just going right over my head. And then God says,

193
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,560
Bezalel, I've equipped him, I've gifted him for this purpose. Bezalel wasn't to

194
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,440
use that which God equipped him with to go out and use it somewhere else for

195
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,740
something else. No, for the work that God had given him to do. So we find that the

196
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,240
writer of Hebrews' first evidence of conversion is that of our service. Notice

197
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
number two, the Bible says there in verse number 10 back in Hebrews 6, for God is

198
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,440
not unrighteous to forget your work, notice, and labor of love, and labor of

199
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,200
love, which ye have showed toward his name, and that ye have ministered to the

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,040
saints, and do minister. You know what's interesting about verse number 10? He

201
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,000
speaks about their work, their service, he speaks about their labor of love, but then

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,520
he shows us that love is an action. He says, which ye have showed toward his

203
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:37,040
name, and that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. Your labor of

204
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,600
love. One of those five walks that Paul gives to the church in Ephesus in

205
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,040
chapters 4, 5, and 6 is found in Ephesians 5 in verse number 2, and here's what it

206
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,720
is. Walk in love. Ephesians 5 in verse number 2. See, we're to love God. By the

207
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,800
way, if you don't love God like you should, you're never gonna love others

208
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,440
like you should. But we're to love God. Why do we love him? Well, according to 1st

209
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,760
John 4 and verse number 19, I love him because he first loved me. What a

210
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,840
blessing to know the love of God. The truth that God so loved the world, the

211
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,440
truth that God commendeth his love toward us. I'm thankful that he

212
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,840
didn't simply declare his love, but then he demonstrated his love for us, and we

213
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,800
understand that we're to love God. You know, the thing that's interesting is,

214
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,680
just as I mentioned, that it's easy to say, I'm a Christian, but there ought to

215
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,400
be some evidences. It's easy to say, I love God. But there's a Bible test. It's

216
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,400
not my test. It's God's test. If you love me, keep my commandments. Right? Now what

217
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,520
the Bible says? That's not my test. That's God's test. So if you

218
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,120
say, I love God, there's a way for you to understand biblically whether you

219
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,920
really do love God. In 1st John chapter number 5, it's interesting, we see

220
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,520
that truth in John 14 and verse number 15, if you love me, keep my commandments.

221
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,480
But in 1st John 5 and verse number 3, the Bible says, for this is the love of

222
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,000
God, that we keep his commandments. And then it says this, and his commandments

223
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,360
are not grievous. We understand that the love of God is best described not as

224
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,400
being permissive, but as being protective. And that's important for us to

225
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,760
understand. See, I love my children, and I show my love for my children. I love my

226
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,960
wife. I show my love for my wife. But my love for my children, if I could use that

227
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,400
illustration specifically, is a protective love. I'm not gonna go let

228
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,000
them do whatever they want to do. Now they're older now. They're 13, 15, and 17.

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,679
And so it's not quite as easy of an illustration. But the reality is that we

230
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
didn't let them go stick a fork in the outlet when they were little toddlers

231
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,679
because they wanted to. Well, I love them, and so I'm just gonna let them do what

232
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,559
they want to do, because love is permissive. They'd lock you up somewhere,

233
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:09,520
right? I mean, you endangered your child. No, no, love is protective. Because I love

234
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,960
you and I understand the danger, therefore I'm gonna protect you from

235
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,640
that. You know that God knows more than you? That shouldn't be a surprise to any

236
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,880
of us, amen? God knows more than you. He knows more than I do. He knows more than

237
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,800
all of us collectively. And you know when God has given us His Word and He said

238
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,400
thou shalt not? He does it because He loves us. He's trying to protect us. And

239
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,340
what a blessing that is. We understand that God's given us this truth with

240
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,080
regard to our love for Him. But it's interesting, I mentioned this just a

241
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,559
moment ago, and here's the Bible verse that supports it in 1 John chapter 4, in

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,280
verse number 20. Yes, we ought to first love God, but the Bible says this, if a

243
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,200
man say I love God and hateth his brother, he is a liar. I mean, that's

244
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,679
straight language, amen?

245
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,719
to the point he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath

246
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,639
seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and we find that when we think

247
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:14,039
about our labor of love as the writer of Hebrews is dealing with this evidence of

248
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,039
conversion not only your service and your work but your labor of love you

249
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,039
understand it's yes first and foremost our love for God but number two our love

250
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,239
for the brethren Jesus in John 13 he said by this shall all men know that

251
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:35,319
you're my disciples by what by your love one for another by your love one for

252
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:42,079
another we find as I mentioned earlier about the church in Thessalonica and the

253
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,399
way in which you saw their progress and you saw their growth and he said in

254
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:51,159
2nd Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3 that their love aboundeth and you see

255
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,999
that growth that is taking place there and what a blessing that is what we

256
00:20:55,999 --> 00:21:01,119
understand in 1st Thessalonians chapter number 4 that here's what Paul says

257
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,599
concerning brotherly love in 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 9 and 10 it says

258
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,439
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for ye

259
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:14,599
yourselves are taught of God to love one another and then notice this great

260
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:21,439
commendation in verse number 10 of 1st Thessalonians 4 and indeed ye do it

261
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:25,759
toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren

262
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:32,599
notice that ye increase more and more you're already loving the brethren

263
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,599
that's good you're supposed to Jesus said that's how we're gonna know or

264
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,479
others are gonna know that you're my disciples by your love one for another

265
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:46,279
in John 13 in verses 34 and 35 and Paul says you're already doing it but I would

266
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,559
that you would increase more and more and then he sends the second letter and

267
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,119
says the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth

268
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,639
isn't that awesome see the model in the church in Corinth isn't the model we're

269
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:06,799
trying to follow divisions and envyings and strife no that's that's immaturity

270
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,279
that's spiritually immature he says I can't speak to you as unto spiritual but

271
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:18,039
unto carnal and see we find here in the book of Hebrews the the challenge that

272
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,559
we're dealing with is to go on to spiritual maturity and he says to them

273
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,839
there are some things that should accompany conversion he references their

274
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:35,359
work their service their labor of love I wonder this morning is there evidence in

275
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:42,199
your life of being born again see I really believe that as we look at these

276
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:47,519
two verses of Scripture in Hebrews 6 9 and 10 and we think about the evidence

277
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,559
of conversion I believe that this evidence of conversion and what the

278
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:59,279
the writer of Hebrews is dealing with here here leads us to an examination see

279
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,239
I want to know as I evaluate and examine my own life are there evidences of

280
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:11,599
conversion and the child of God should be interested in knowing hey is there

281
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,919
anything in my life that would give evidence that I'm a child of God notice

282
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,759
this exhortation to conclude the book of 2nd Corinthians you don't need to

283
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,239
turn there I'll read it for you but in 2nd Corinthians chapter 13 in verse

284
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:29,639
number 5 the the Apostle Paul says this to these believers he says examine

285
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:40,639
yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your

286
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,839
own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates the reality

287
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,919
is that this exhortation in 2nd Corinthians 13 to examine themselves

288
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,079
really I believe is an important exhortation in light of what we read

289
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:02,039
here in Hebrews chapter number 6 is there evidence of conversion it's not

290
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,239
for me necessarily to examine although the Bible says by their fruit you shall

291
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:13,519
know them but really the admonition here is for you to examine yourself are there

292
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,720
evidences of conversion in your life I hope that you can say yes there are I

293
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,720
hope that these believers here that are being written to in the book of Hebrews

294
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,519
that as they receive as they come to the sixth chapter as we have the division in

295
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,399
our Bible that they would have this time of looking at these evidences and saying

296
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,199
that they would do this evaluation this examination if you will the text

297
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:42,720
continues in verses 11 and 12 we see first of all if you're taking notes the

298
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,600
evidence of conversion but now I want you to see in verses 11 and 12 the

299
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,079
expectation to continue we see that consistent throughout the Word of God we

300
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,179
mentioned already there in the book of 1st and 2nd Thessalonians how that the

301
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,839
Apostle Paul is encouraging those believers to press on to continue we

302
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,839
find that in John 8 in verse number 31 Jesus said if you continue in my word

303
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:14,759
then are you my disciples indeed and so there's an expectation to continue you

304
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,919
understand this very important truth this morning that you never arrive in

305
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,759
the Christian life we ought to always be moving forward in our growth why because

306
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,359
we're to be like Jesus and Jesus is perfect he left us an example according

307
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,639
to what Peter said that we should follow his steps and what a blessing to

308
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:38,000
understand that progress that we make daily as we walk with God listen I don't

309
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,880
I can't even tell you I wish I would have kept track years ago on how many

310
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,839
times I've read through the Bible I'd never I just never kept track of it so I

311
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,639
can't tell you how many times I've read through the Bible but it's not enough I

312
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:55,959
read it every day every day I want more of it I want more of it I want more of

313
00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:01,880
it there are plenty of books that I've read once and I've never opened them

314
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,559
again plenty there are some that I've opened and I've never finished maybe

315
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,160
some of you can relate there are a handful of books that I have reread

316
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,799
that I've said you know what this is a good book it's a good reminder this is

317
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,239
something that I need to add to my annual reading list I have a couple of

318
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:25,600
books like that but there's no book that even comes close to how often I read

319
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,479
this book Clarence Sexton said don't get your theology from some textbook get it

320
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:37,119
from the Bible that's a good truth and I'm thankful for the books that people

321
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,720
have written I'm thankful for the information that is out there but if I

322
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,320
spend too much time reading that and not enough time reading this I'm in trouble

323
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,399
I need the Bible and so we're continually making that progress notice

324
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,359
what he says in verse number 11 and we desire you see this desire on the part

325
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,160
of the spiritual leader for the the followers to continue and to make that

326
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,440
progress I mentioned as we started this warning passage in Hebrews 5 in verse

327
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,839
number 11 when the writer said of whom we have many things to say and hard to

328
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,679
be uttered seeing your dull of hearing it wasn't that the teacher had a hard

329
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,320
time giving the truth it was that the teacher understood the student wasn't

330
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:27,839
ready for it they were dull of hearing and as we understand the the heart and

331
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:34,039
the concern of the spiritual leader to give truth to fulfill the Great

332
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,799
Commission not only to preach the gospel and to baptize but to teach them all

333
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:46,279
things and we understand here that he says we desire that every one of you do

334
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,880
show notice what he says the same diligence to the full assurance of hope

335
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,880
unto the end now that's a lot of truth in there and the reality is that we

336
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,600
ought to as we understand this truth of continuing and this expectation to

337
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,600
continue that we find that we're to continue notice unto the end until you're

338
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,320
taken to glory you ought to be growing in your Christian walk amen every day

339
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:24,880
you ought to be growing we never arrive we make progress day by day I've said

340
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,119
often over the years that you're as close to God today as you really want to

341
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,760
be the one that is the youngest spiritually in our midst could be the

342
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,760
most spiritual in our midst we ought to be making progress every day and you

343
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,719
notice these as we desire that anyone every one of you notice what he says do

344
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:50,479
show the same diligence he says in verse number 12 that you be not slothful you

345
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,399
put those thoughts together and you understand there's a purpose that the

346
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,039
individual has if you read the book of Psalms and it's a wonderful encouraging

347
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,279
thing as you read through all of the Psalms but something that you'll notice

348
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,760
as you read through the book of Psalms that oftentimes you find these

349
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,000
statements of the psalmist I will I will I will and they're these purposed

350
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,960
statements of some things that the psalmist says he's going to do and the

351
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,239
importance as we understand our lives that we have this diligence that we're

352
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:27,239
not slothful that we understand listen there's some effort that we need to put

353
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:32,520
into this thing of growing spiritually I remember when I was a kid and I I

354
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,000
remember so I don't even know who it was some probably my brother because he's

355
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,679
always trying to tell a story but somebody was talking about how you could

356
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,719
sleep on a on a textbook and by osmosis you would just get the stuff right how

357
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:49,679
like that's a really good idea you know what it's not true right I mean it just

358
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,359
doesn't work but but the reality is that if I want to grow in my walk with Christ

359
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:03,359
I gotta put some effort into it if you want any relationship to grow

360
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,939
you've got to put effort into it.

361
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,119
There's got to be an investment.

362
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,919
If I want my marriage to be what it needs to be,

363
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,499
if our relationship is going to be what it needs to be,

364
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:16,139
I need to be making some investment,

365
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:19,379
some purposed investment in our relationship.

366
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:21,299
If I want relationship with my kids

367
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,539
and I want that to be what it ought to be,

368
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:24,939
I need to invest in it.

369
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:28,539
I need to purpose in that relationship.

370
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,659
I'm thankful that I have a relationship with God

371
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:31,579
that is constant.

372
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,019
He's my Father and I am His child

373
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:35,659
and what a blessing that is.

374
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,899
When we think about the truth of fellowship

375
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,619
in our walk with God,

376
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:42,319
we need to invest in it.

377
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,819
We need to spend time, right?

378
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,659
You know what the greatest investment is

379
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,439
that you can make in your relationships

380
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:51,679
with your spouse and with your children is time.

381
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,539
One of the early presidents of the United States of America,

382
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:00,979
he took a day to go and spend with his son

383
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:02,499
and to go fishing.

384
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,739
Both of them took journals.

385
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,379
It was a daily routine in their lives

386
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,099
to have journal and to journal through things.

387
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,219
And the president of the United States after that day

388
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:17,659
said, went fishing with my boy, a day wasted.

389
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:21,899
That's what he said.

390
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:25,699
On the very same day in the journal of the son,

391
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:30,159
went fishing with my dad, best day of my life.

392
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:32,979
Does that give you some perspective?

393
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,619
Time.

394
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,899
It takes time to read the Bible.

395
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,419
It takes time to pray.

396
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:41,679
It just does.

397
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:47,179
My dad, years ago, I think it was in 1998,

398
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:48,499
I was a senior in high school

399
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,539
and I remember he was given a devotion

400
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,779
in our church in California

401
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,659
to the men at a men's prayer breakfast

402
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,379
and I remember him using an illustration

403
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,859
of a book that he saw.

404
00:31:58,859 --> 00:31:59,979
I don't think he bought it,

405
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:02,099
but it was a book that he saw at a Christian bookstore

406
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,579
and it said how to pray in nine minutes

407
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,899
and 59 seconds or less.

408
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,819
And it was just this idea of this fast-paced society, right?

409
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,459
And he used his illustration,

410
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,059
really in the negative context of the illustration.

411
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:15,879
Why?

412
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:18,019
Because we need to labor in prayer.

413
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,379
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

414
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:24,899
availeth much, our God hears and answers prayer.

415
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,699
And we find that there's this investment.

416
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,539
He says, continue unto the end.

417
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,059
I think about this truth, run your race.

418
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,939
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

419
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:36,299
we have as our theme, verse number two,

420
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,939
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

421
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,599
but we find that in verse number one

422
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,059
of Hebrews chapter number 12,

423
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,619
it says, wherefore seeing also we are compassed about

424
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,419
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

425
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,179
let us lay aside every weight and the sin

426
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,779
which doth so easily beset us

427
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,619
and let us run with patience the race

428
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,739
that is set before us.

429
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,219
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

430
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:01,099
who for the joy that was set before him

431
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:03,219
endured the cross, despising the shame,

432
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:07,939
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

433
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,339
We need to run our race.

434
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:12,219
Faithful unto the end.

435
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:14,419
Some have said over the years,

436
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,899
they didn't start well, but they finished well.

437
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,679
I like that.

438
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,179
I wanna finish well.

439
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:24,579
I wanna be able to say, as Paul said,

440
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,659
I finished my course.

441
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,899
But you know, that didn't happen by accident.

442
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,739
If you study the life of Paul,

443
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:32,819
and you were to look at 2 Timothy chapter number four

444
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,739
in verses seven and eight,

445
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,499
when he says to Timothy, his son in the faith,

446
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:39,019
the time of my departure's at hand.

447
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,819
And he says, I have finished my course.

448
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,659
If you look back in chapter number 20 of the book of Acts,

449
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,259
and you see as the apostle Paul

450
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,859
is speaking to the Ephesian elders,

451
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:54,939
he says to them that I might finish my course with joy.

452
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,779
It was a desire that Paul had.

453
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,859
He didn't just end up finishing strong or finishing well.

454
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:06,059
He purposed to finish well.

455
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,499
There's some decisions he had to make along the way

456
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:14,459
to accomplish that which he set out to accomplish.

457
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:19,139
So thankful that God helps us along the way.

458
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,539
We think about this expectation to continue,

459
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,059
and we find that it was to continue unto the end.

460
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,779
But we also notice in verse number 12,

461
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:30,219
look what he says, that ye be not slothful, notice this,

462
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:35,219
but followers of them who through faith and patience

463
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:38,500
inherit the promises.

464
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,539
Now, we find that he talks about here,

465
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,339
but be followers of them.

466
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:44,299
Who's them?

467
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,579
Who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

468
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:50,219
You know, there are many examples for us to follow.

469
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:55,019
In fact, as we look at this thought of faith and patience

470
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,459
that is listed here, in just a few chapters,

471
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,899
you're gonna come to Hebrews chapter number 11.

472
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,859
We often speak of Hebrews chapter number 11

473
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,619
as being a hall of faith chapter.

474
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,500
By faith, this one did this.

475
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
By faith, this one did this, right?

476
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,019
And you find you get to the end of the chapter,

477
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:13,219
and he says, we don't have enough time.

478
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:17,139
And so he just kind of wraps up quickly a number of things.

479
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,299
The people that he's going to reference,

480
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:22,099
but you find that in Hebrews chapter number 11,

481
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,899
he said there's some examples to follow.

482
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:29,619
Who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

483
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,059
I think about the example of the Apostle Paul.

484
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,939
We've mentioned him often today.

485
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,299
He said to the believers in Corinth,

486
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,219
be followers of me, even so as I am of the Lord.

487
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:43,299
See, the Apostle Paul followed the Lord Jesus Christ.

488
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:46,539
And therefore, he could say, be followers of me.

489
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:48,859
He wasn't trying to get a group of people

490
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:51,059
to follow him and start his own thing.

491
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:54,739
No, he was saying, I can be an example for you.

492
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:58,619
We find that he says in Philippians in chapter number four,

493
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,659
in verse number nine, with regard to the admonition

494
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:04,779
to the believers in Philippi,

495
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,819
he says those things which you have both learned

496
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,939
and received and heard, but then he says this,

497
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:13,819
and seen in me, do.

498
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,659
The God of peace shall be with you.

499
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:20,339
It's interesting as I think about the many examples

500
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,459
that we have to follow, and I think about this truth

501
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,219
in Hebrews chapter number six in verse number 12.

502
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,939
He talks about but followers of them

503
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:30,739
who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

504
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:33,179
The reality is that if you stay within the context

505
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:35,979
of the book of Hebrews and you come to the final chapter

506
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:38,659
in chapter number 13 in verse number seven,

507
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:43,619
I want you to notice what is said with regard to one group,

508
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,979
at least of folks that ought to be a good example to follow.

509
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:49,059
He says in verse number seven of Hebrews 13,

510
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,819
remember them which have the rule over you,

511
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:54,899
who have spoken unto you the word of God.

512
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:58,339
Notice this, whose faith follow,

513
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:02,099
considering the end of their conversation,

514
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,619
their lifestyle, their behavior, whose faith follow.

515
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:08,419
The one being spoken of in Hebrews 13 in verse number seven

516
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:12,699
is the spiritual leader, the pastor if you will,

517
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,779
that they have spoken unto you the word of God

518
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,539
and whose faith follow.

519
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,859
You know, it ought to be that the message of the lips

520
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,339
matches the message of the life.

521
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,939
Or maybe I should say that the other way around,

522
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,019
that the message of our life

523
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,779
matches the message of our lips.

524
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:32,899
Solomon said, my son, give me thine heart

525
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:37,219
and let thine eyes observe my ways.

526
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:39,579
Now we know that Solomon wasn't a great example.

527
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,659
You study his life and of course many errors in his life.

528
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,859
Though he had great wisdom.

529
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:47,339
And the reality today is that we find

530
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,299
that he speaks about this at the end of Hebrews 13

531
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:53,219
about the example and whose faith follow.

532
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,859
It's interesting if you couple this truth

533
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,899
with the challenge that the Apostle Paul gave to Timothy

534
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:01,899
in first Timothy in verse number 12 of the fourth chapter,

535
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:06,019
he says that you're to be an example of the believers.

536
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:09,939
Why didn't he tell Timothy to be an example?

537
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,459
Whose faith follow.

538
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:12,859
Timothy was gonna be in that place

539
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,859
of being a spiritual leader.

540
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:19,379
And he said, Timothy, you're an example to these believers.

541
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:23,619
And we think about this passage of scripture,

542
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,219
things that accompany salvation.

543
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,619
See, there are, there should be in your life

544
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:32,339
evidences of conversion.

545
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:34,539
There should be.

546
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,859
We can examine ourselves and say,

547
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,299
are there any evidences in my life that I belong to Christ?

548
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,179
No, we're not gonna be perfect.

549
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:44,700
We understand that.

550
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,659
But there ought to be some signs of life spiritually.

551
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,739
There ought to be some birthmarks of a believer.

552
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,019
And then there's an expectation to continue.

553
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,179
That we continue to walk with God.

554
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:00,140
We see that he speaks about continuing unto the end.

555
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,579
We see that he speaks about the example follow,

556
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,140
to be followers of them who through faith and patience

557
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
inherit the promises.

558
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,140
And I wonder this morning as we conclude our message,

559
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,419
we've mentioned several that are examples for us to follow.

560
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,859
But I wonder and I would ask you,

561
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,419
I've asked myself the question

562
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,099
and I want you to ask yourself the question

563
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,899
this morning as well.

564
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:27,619
Who can look at your life as an example to follow?

565
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:33,380
Is there someone that you could say,

566
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,099
as Paul did, be followers of me?

567
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,260
That you would so closely follow the Lord Jesus Christ

568
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,059
that your life would be worth,

569
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,419
that would be that example that would be worth following.

570
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,739
I hope that you can say yes.

571
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:56,059
Many times in life in various venues and settings,

572
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:00,219
I have observed individuals, parents to be specific,

573
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,219
who are embarrassed by some of the behavior.

574
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:08,599
of their children. Have you? And sometimes the parent that's embarrassed says something

575
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:15,799
like this, I have no idea where they learned that. And you just kind of chuckle and say,

576
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:21,699
hmm, I got a pretty good idea where they probably learned that. What do children do? They follow

577
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:28,939
the examples. Spiritually speaking, we're to be an example. There's some people, some

578
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:35,259
examples that we can follow. And we ought to be an example for others to follow. And

579
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:39,259
it doesn't always have to be somebody that's younger. Because spiritually speaking, the

580
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:48,079
youngest again among us can be the most spiritual and can be one of the best examples. Amen?

581
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,599
And so this morning, things that accompany salvation, are there evidences of conversion?

582
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,439
You need to know that for yourself. Examine yourself. Am I in the faith? Yes, I've been

583
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:07,439
born again. And there are evidences of conversion in my life. And then there's this expectation

584
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:12,239
to continue. Don't give up. Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer

585
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,319
persecution. There are times in which it's tough. The devil's fighting and he's attacking.

586
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,359
So we're going to continue. We're going to be faithful until the end. Not in my own power,

587
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:29,599
but in the power of Christ in me. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving

588
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,679
us. Thank You for the Word of God and the truth that's contained therein. We thank You

589
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:40,799
for this passage of Scripture that gives us these things that accompany salvation. The

590
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:47,799
evidences specifically in the text, the labor, the service of Your people and the love, love

591
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,359
for God, love for the brethren. God, I pray that those that are watching online, those

592
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,119
that are gathered here at the church house, Lord, that we would be able to say there are

593
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:04,119
evidences in our lives of conversion. However, we understand that there might be one among

594
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,719
us or one that's watching that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

595
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:14,599
God, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation. They would not leave

596
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:21,039
this place without knowing for sure that heaven is their home. And Father, I pray that even

597
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,959
as we see the expectation to continue that You would help us, Lord, to keep our eyes

598
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:31,479
upon Jesus, that we would run our race, that we would be faithful unto the end, that we

599
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:35,039
would consider the examples of those that have gone before us and that, God, we would

600
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,679
be an example for those that would follow. Use us, Lord, for Your honor and for Your

601
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,479
glory. We'll thank You for the work that You'll do in our lives. For it's in Christ's name

602
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,679
we pray. We will have a moment of invitation. Stand with me. Kimberly's going to play on

603
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:54,719
the piano. You can make your own pew, your altar. If you want to come up here, you can.

604
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,839
Try to be careful, of course, with all of those things and at home, those that are watching,

605
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,839
make your living room or wherever it is that you're watching your altar this morning. But

606
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,279
if the Spirit of God spoke to your heart today, the altar is open as Kimberly plays.
