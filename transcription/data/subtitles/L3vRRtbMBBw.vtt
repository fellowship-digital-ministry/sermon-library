WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.659
We have not been in the book of Hebrews, but we are planning have been working through the book of Hebrews here in

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:12.800
2020 with our theme being looking unto Jesus. I'm so thankful. I've had so many

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.040
opportunities to speak with people during this pandemic

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:22.340
that have been fearful and concerned and all sorts of things and I've been able to share with them how in

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.360
September of

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.000
2019 God led me to this theme

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.479
looking unto Jesus for

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.520
2020 of course, I had no idea what

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:36.720
2020 was going to hold but God did and I've told people this many times

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.520
You've heard me say it even during the services

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.080
We can have the peace of God which passeth all understanding not because we have our head in the sand

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:48.400
but because we have our eyes on our Savior and

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:54.560
I'm so thankful to know that he is in control when it seems like everything is out of control

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.220
It's good to know the one that is in control

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.880
Amen, and what a blessing to know that he sits upon his throne. He rules and reigns. He is the Lord God

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.639
Omnipotent Hebrews chapter number six. We'll be looking at verses 9 through 12

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.160
Hebrews 6 verses 9 through 12. The Bible says this but beloved

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.500
We are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:24.199
Though we thus speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.959
which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.059
Do minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.519
Unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:49.800
Inherit the promises you notice in our text of Scripture here in Hebrews 5 verse number 11

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.800
Down through really the entirety of chapter number 6 we've been dealing with this warning passage

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.720
we mentioned that the warning passage initially dealt with a a

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:05.160
Confronting of those that were being written to they were confronted about what they were confronted about their spiritual immaturity

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.880
They had not been growing in the time that you ought to be teachers

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.559
You have need that one teach you is what they were told and so we find that they are confronted about their spiritual

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
immaturity and then they are

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Challenged to go on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.559
to perfection to grow spiritually to become mature in Christ and what a blessing to understand the

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:33.919
Importance of growth as a believer and obviously in the last portion of Hebrews 6 that we studied several weeks ago

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.600
In fact, it was the first Sunday of the month of May

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.839
We dealt with the passage of Scripture of go on to spiritual maturity

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.479
We took several minutes in that message to deal with the use of pronouns

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.720
throughout the passage to understand how the

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:57.800
text of Scripture was being written and we come to the text that we're dealing with this morning and we find in verse number 9 there's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800
that great conjunction but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.360
Beloved and so we find that the writer of Hebrews is now

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.839
Addressing this group of people these believers that the warning initially was given to in

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.479
chapter number 5 in verses 11 14

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.960
listen a lost person is not challenged with growing spiritually a lost person is challenged with conversion and

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.320
Then as you're saved you're to go on to spiritual maturity

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.139
And so as we look at the text of Scripture that is before us this morning

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.399
I've titled the message from verse number 9 things that accompany

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.800
Salvation things that accompany salvation

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.720
I'm mindful of what the Apostle Paul said to the church in Thessalonica and we've often

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:51.119
referenced the church in Thessalonica and we've spoken about the fact that this is a model church a church that was

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:52.919
exhibiting

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.919
spiritual character in growing

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.419
Paul says this in 1st Thessalonians 1 in verse number 3

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.259
Remembering without ceasing

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.020
Your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.619
Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father as he writes to them in the second epistle again

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.859
In chapter 1 in verse number 3. He says we are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is me

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.820
Why because that your faith groweth?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.459
Exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.500
Aboundeth do you notice those words as he writes the second epistle? He writes the first letter

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.820
He says I'm thankful for these things. But as he writes the second letter, he notes progress

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.940
He notes the fact that he says that you your faith grow with

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:50.500
Exceedingly and then he says of their love that they have one toward another that it aboundeth

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:58.059
Those are words that describe progress that describe growth and we'd understand in the Christian life that there ought to be

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:03.339
Progress there ought to be growth there ought to be things that accompany

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.940
salvation number one if you're taking notes notice the evidence of conversion the evidence of conversion the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.019
The writer says but beloved we are persuaded of better things of you

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.220
notice and things

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
that accompany

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.899
Salvation the things there's a just a couple that are listed here in in Hebrews chapter number six

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:33.779
But we understand as we study the whole of Scripture that you could certainly develop a more robust

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.179
List of what I often refer to as birthmarks of a believer. There are signs

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:48.459
There are evidences of life. In fact, there are evidence of evidences of life in you physically speaking even now

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.859
Right, you're sitting up you're breathing your eyes are open most of you

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.660
but the reality is there are evidences of life right and so as a

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:04.459
Believer there ought to be some birthmarks of the believer. There ought to be some evidences

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.299
Some have said this over the years some preachers of yesteryear

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:16.820
have noted the truth of the birthmarks of believers in the evidence of conversion and they've often asked this question if

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.899
You were charged in a court of law and the crime that you were charged of was being a Christian

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.540
Would there be enough evidence to convict you? That's a good thought. I like the thought I'm not a lawyer

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.540
I don't want to talk to too many more lawyers

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:38.459
Except for brother Michael. Amen, but the reality is that we wonder is there the evidence? Is it there?

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.000
Does it support the claim see it's easy for somebody to say I'm a Christian

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
It's

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.239
Another thing to have evidence of conversion

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.720
The Bible tells us in 2nd Corinthians 5 in verse number 17 if any man be in Christ

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:55.519
He is a new creature old things are passed away behold

00:06:55.519 --> 00:07:01.160
All things are become new the Bible tells us in 1st Peter 2 in verse number 2 as newborn

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:05.000
Babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.880
thereby

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.260
And we look at the passage of Scripture and deal with the specific nature of what the

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.440
Evidences are that they speak of and he says the things that accompany salvation

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:24.239
Though we thus speak notice in verse number 10 for God is not unrighteous number one to forget your work

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.660
And so we notice the evidence of conversion would be their service their work for the Lord now

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.899
It's important for us to understand that works cannot save you

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.339
It's absolutely impossible

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.859
The only thing that can save us is the blood of Jesus Christ his death burial and glorious resurrection

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:51.140
The gospel as we often refer to it, but we understand this morning that our works or our service for Christ

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.420
They reveal our

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:00.100
Position in Christ if you study the book of Ephesians, which we did in 2019 as a church family

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.940
I preached the entire book on Sunday mornings through the book of Ephesians

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:10.980
And you find that in the first few chapters. In fact, the first three chapters of Ephesians deal with

00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:18.739
Establishing your position in Christ who we are in Christ these believers that Paul is writing to in Ephesus

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.019
he had ministered there and he was

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:26.700
Reminding them of their conversion and reminding them of their position in Christ

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:31.059
He says this in Ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9 for by grace

00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:33.820
Are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.500
It is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:44.539
Unless we forget so many people think that Paul and James are contrary one to the other. They actually

00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:50.700
Work perfect in unity one with the other Paul is dealing with the root of salvation

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.140
James is dealing with the fruit of salvation

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.500
But you must understand and acknowledge this morning that though the Apostle Paul deals with the root of salvation

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:07.299
He often speaks about the fruit of salvation in the very next verse in Ephesians 2 in verse number 10

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.340
He says for we are

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500
his workmanship

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:18.539
Created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Oh Paul used the word good works

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.179
Yeah, but he says that's what that's the evidence of salvation that helps us to understand

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:26.739
And to reveal our position in Christ

00:09:26.739 --> 00:09:30.859
He says that we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.780
What's God hath before ordained that we should walk in?

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:41.539
Them it's interesting that in the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians Paul spends much time

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.539
Helping to establish their position in Christ

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:51.059
But if you get into chapters 4 5 & 6 you notice on five occasions

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:53.419
What does Paul reference their walk?

00:09:54.179 --> 00:10:00.020
Their walk their behavior. I said often as we studied the book of Ephesians in

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.920
2019, that as Paul gets into the latter part, the second half of the book of

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.680
Ephesians, he's not telling these people, it's important to understand this, two

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.080
important truths. He's not telling them, these are the things you do to be saved,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.320
nor is he telling them, these are the things that you do to stay saved. No. He's

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.720
telling them, these are the things that you do because you are saved. These are

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.480
the evidences of salvation. Your work in the book of Titus, on a number of

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.600
occasions, it's a short letter, just a few chapters, and we find that as

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.920
Paul is writing to Titus and he's giving instruction with regard to the work at

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.120
Crete and that which Titus was responsible for, you know that on a

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.560
number of occasions in that book he references good works? He says this in

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.560
Titus 2 in verse number 7, in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.160
in doctrine, showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.320
cannot be condemned, that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.660
no evil thing to say of you. Remember, we sing the song, there's been a great

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.200
change since I've been born again. We sing it with the kids, right? We ought to

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.240
sing it as adults. The things I used to say, I don't say them anymore, right? What

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.520
does it say here in verse number 8? Sound speech that cannot be condemned. The

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.520
things I used to say, I don't say them anymore. The things I used to do, I don't

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.800
do them anymore. The place I used to go, I don't go there anymore. Why?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.480
There's been a great change since I've been born again. Praise the Lord for

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.060
conversion. He says a little bit later here in the book of Titus, and look in

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.280
verse number 14, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.320
iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.440
But you notice in chapter number 3, in verse number 5, that Paul also says, not

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.560
by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.400
us. There's no contradiction. It's the evidence of salvation, our work, our

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.840
service. He will say in verse number 14, nearing the end of the book of Titus of

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.320
chapter 3 and verse 14, and let ours also learn to maintain good works for

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.720
necessary uses that they be not unfruitful. It's interesting if you were

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.240
to read about the seven churches in Asia in Revelation 2 and 3, in each of the

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.520
letters that are written to those seven churches, you find that God says

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:44.320
through John, I know thy works. I know thy works. Every church that's mentioned in

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.160
Revelation 2 and 3, all seven of those churches in Asia, God says, the Lord Jesus

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.600
Christ says, I know thy works. Notice what the writer of Hebrews says to these

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.400
believers that he's writing to. He says, these things that accompany salvation,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:07.440
the first one he says, for God is not unrighteous to forget your work. The

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.840
first evidence of salvation that is dealt with here in Hebrews 6 is our

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.280
service to our God. You know, as a believer, there are many things that

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.720
happen at the time of conversion, and most of us, the day in which we got saved,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.720
we probably didn't understand all of those things that happened on that day.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.800
But as we've grown in Christ, we've learned some of those things that

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.680
happen. The wonderful truth of conversion and understanding that our

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.200
bodies, we're the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in us, right? We've been

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.360
indwelled by the Spirit of God which is the proof of our salvation according to

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.520
Ephesians 1, and we find that the Bible speaks about the fact that we have been

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.440
given gifts, spiritual gifts. Every believer has been equipped by God

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:02.280
Almighty with a spiritual gift. Why? For the work, for the work of the ministry.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.240
Paul told the same group of people that we've referenced multiple times here in

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.440
the church at Ephesus, he told them in chapter number 4 and verse number 11, and

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.520
he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:21.520
and teachers for the perfecting of the saints' notice for the work of the

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.840
ministry. Everybody doing their part. We speak about many hands make light work,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.120
but we think about the way in which the Holy Spirit of God has gifted the church,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.400
and we find that God uses the illustration of the human body. I'm

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.600
thankful that I have a right hand and a left hand. My left hand's a little bit

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.720
behind because I'm right-handed, and sometimes I say this hand doesn't do what

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.840
I want it to do, but I'm really glad I don't have two right hands. Amen? And you

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.160
can think about the way that God has designed our bodies, and we

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.680
understand the illustration of the body of believers, the church, and how God has

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.240
individually gifted every believer. Why? For the work. The purpose of your

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.520
spiritual gift is not so you can use it for yourself, it's that you use it in the

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.640
church for the glory of God. I often think about the Old Testament

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000
illustration in the book of Exodus. In fact, I'll be looking at Exodus chapter

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.120
40 this evening as what I'll be preaching from, but if you look in all of

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.880
that passage at the end of the book of Exodus dealing with the construction of

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.960
the tabernacle, there's a man by the name of Bezalel, and Bezalel was gifted by

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.520
God for all of that work that God had instructed Moses to do. I'll be honest

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.440
with you, if I was Moses receiving all of that instruction with all of those

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.680
pieces of furniture, it's just going right over my head. And then God says,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.560
Bezalel, I've equipped him, I've gifted him for this purpose. Bezalel wasn't to

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.440
use that which God equipped him with to go out and use it somewhere else for

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.740
something else. No, for the work that God had given him to do. So we find that the

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.240
writer of Hebrews' first evidence of conversion is that of our service. Notice

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.480
number two, the Bible says there in verse number 10 back in Hebrews 6, for God is

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.440
not unrighteous to forget your work, notice, and labor of love, and labor of

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.200
love, which ye have showed toward his name, and that ye have ministered to the

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.040
saints, and do minister. You know what's interesting about verse number 10? He

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.000
speaks about their work, their service, he speaks about their labor of love, but then

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.520
he shows us that love is an action. He says, which ye have showed toward his

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:37.040
name, and that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. Your labor of

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.600
love. One of those five walks that Paul gives to the church in Ephesus in

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.040
chapters 4, 5, and 6 is found in Ephesians 5 in verse number 2, and here's what it

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.720
is. Walk in love. Ephesians 5 in verse number 2. See, we're to love God. By the

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.800
way, if you don't love God like you should, you're never gonna love others

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.440
like you should. But we're to love God. Why do we love him? Well, according to 1st

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.760
John 4 and verse number 19, I love him because he first loved me. What a

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.840
blessing to know the love of God. The truth that God so loved the world, the

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.440
truth that God commendeth his love toward us. I'm thankful that he

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.840
didn't simply declare his love, but then he demonstrated his love for us, and we

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.800
understand that we're to love God. You know, the thing that's interesting is,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.680
just as I mentioned, that it's easy to say, I'm a Christian, but there ought to

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.400
be some evidences. It's easy to say, I love God. But there's a Bible test. It's

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.400
not my test. It's God's test. If you love me, keep my commandments. Right? Now what

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.520
the Bible says? That's not my test. That's God's test. So if you

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.120
say, I love God, there's a way for you to understand biblically whether you

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.920
really do love God. In 1st John chapter number 5, it's interesting, we see

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.520
that truth in John 14 and verse number 15, if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.480
But in 1st John 5 and verse number 3, the Bible says, for this is the love of

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.000
God, that we keep his commandments. And then it says this, and his commandments

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.360
are not grievous. We understand that the love of God is best described not as

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.400
being permissive, but as being protective. And that's important for us to

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.760
understand. See, I love my children, and I show my love for my children. I love my

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.960
wife. I show my love for my wife. But my love for my children, if I could use that

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.400
illustration specifically, is a protective love. I'm not gonna go let

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.000
them do whatever they want to do. Now they're older now. They're 13, 15, and 17.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.679
And so it's not quite as easy of an illustration. But the reality is that we

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:55.200
didn't let them go stick a fork in the outlet when they were little toddlers

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.679
because they wanted to. Well, I love them, and so I'm just gonna let them do what

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:03.559
they want to do, because love is permissive. They'd lock you up somewhere,

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:09.520
right? I mean, you endangered your child. No, no, love is protective. Because I love

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.960
you and I understand the danger, therefore I'm gonna protect you from

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.640
that. You know that God knows more than you? That shouldn't be a surprise to any

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.880
of us, amen? God knows more than you. He knows more than I do. He knows more than

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.800
all of us collectively. And you know when God has given us His Word and He said

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.400
thou shalt not? He does it because He loves us. He's trying to protect us. And

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.340
what a blessing that is. We understand that God's given us this truth with

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.080
regard to our love for Him. But it's interesting, I mentioned this just a

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.559
moment ago, and here's the Bible verse that supports it in 1 John chapter 4, in

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.280
verse number 20. Yes, we ought to first love God, but the Bible says this, if a

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:58.200
man say I love God and hateth his brother, he is a liar. I mean, that's

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.679
straight language, amen?

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:05.719
to the point he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath

00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:09.639
seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and we find that when we think

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:14.039
about our labor of love as the writer of Hebrews is dealing with this evidence of

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:19.039
conversion not only your service and your work but your labor of love you

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:23.039
understand it's yes first and foremost our love for God but number two our love

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:29.239
for the brethren Jesus in John 13 he said by this shall all men know that

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:35.319
you're my disciples by what by your love one for another by your love one for

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:42.079
another we find as I mentioned earlier about the church in Thessalonica and the

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:46.399
way in which you saw their progress and you saw their growth and he said in

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:51.159
2nd Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3 that their love aboundeth and you see

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:55.999
that growth that is taking place there and what a blessing that is what we

00:20:55.999 --> 00:21:01.119
understand in 1st Thessalonians chapter number 4 that here's what Paul says

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:05.599
concerning brotherly love in 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 9 and 10 it says

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:10.439
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for ye

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:14.599
yourselves are taught of God to love one another and then notice this great

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:21.439
commendation in verse number 10 of 1st Thessalonians 4 and indeed ye do it

00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:25.759
toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:32.599
notice that ye increase more and more you're already loving the brethren

00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:37.599
that's good you're supposed to Jesus said that's how we're gonna know or

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.479
others are gonna know that you're my disciples by your love one for another

00:21:40.479 --> 00:21:46.279
in John 13 in verses 34 and 35 and Paul says you're already doing it but I would

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:50.559
that you would increase more and more and then he sends the second letter and

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:55.119
says the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth

00:21:55.119 --> 00:22:00.639
isn't that awesome see the model in the church in Corinth isn't the model we're

00:22:00.639 --> 00:22:06.799
trying to follow divisions and envyings and strife no that's that's immaturity

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:12.279
that's spiritually immature he says I can't speak to you as unto spiritual but

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:18.039
unto carnal and see we find here in the book of Hebrews the the challenge that

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:22.559
we're dealing with is to go on to spiritual maturity and he says to them

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:28.839
there are some things that should accompany conversion he references their

00:22:28.839 --> 00:22:35.359
work their service their labor of love I wonder this morning is there evidence in

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:42.199
your life of being born again see I really believe that as we look at these

00:22:42.199 --> 00:22:47.519
two verses of Scripture in Hebrews 6 9 and 10 and we think about the evidence

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:52.559
of conversion I believe that this evidence of conversion and what the

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:59.279
the writer of Hebrews is dealing with here here leads us to an examination see

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:05.239
I want to know as I evaluate and examine my own life are there evidences of

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:11.599
conversion and the child of God should be interested in knowing hey is there

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:16.919
anything in my life that would give evidence that I'm a child of God notice

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:20.759
this exhortation to conclude the book of 2nd Corinthians you don't need to

00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:24.239
turn there I'll read it for you but in 2nd Corinthians chapter 13 in verse

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:29.639
number 5 the the Apostle Paul says this to these believers he says examine

00:23:29.639 --> 00:23:40.639
yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your

00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:46.839
own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates the reality

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:51.919
is that this exhortation in 2nd Corinthians 13 to examine themselves

00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:57.079
really I believe is an important exhortation in light of what we read

00:23:57.079 --> 00:24:02.039
here in Hebrews chapter number 6 is there evidence of conversion it's not

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:06.239
for me necessarily to examine although the Bible says by their fruit you shall

00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:13.519
know them but really the admonition here is for you to examine yourself are there

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:17.720
evidences of conversion in your life I hope that you can say yes there are I

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.720
hope that these believers here that are being written to in the book of Hebrews

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.519
that as they receive as they come to the sixth chapter as we have the division in

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:31.399
our Bible that they would have this time of looking at these evidences and saying

00:24:31.399 --> 00:24:37.199
that they would do this evaluation this examination if you will the text

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:42.720
continues in verses 11 and 12 we see first of all if you're taking notes the

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.600
evidence of conversion but now I want you to see in verses 11 and 12 the

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:53.079
expectation to continue we see that consistent throughout the Word of God we

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:57.179
mentioned already there in the book of 1st and 2nd Thessalonians how that the

00:24:57.179 --> 00:25:01.839
Apostle Paul is encouraging those believers to press on to continue we

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:07.839
find that in John 8 in verse number 31 Jesus said if you continue in my word

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:14.759
then are you my disciples indeed and so there's an expectation to continue you

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:17.919
understand this very important truth this morning that you never arrive in

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:23.759
the Christian life we ought to always be moving forward in our growth why because

00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:28.359
we're to be like Jesus and Jesus is perfect he left us an example according

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:32.639
to what Peter said that we should follow his steps and what a blessing to

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:38.000
understand that progress that we make daily as we walk with God listen I don't

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.880
I can't even tell you I wish I would have kept track years ago on how many

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.839
times I've read through the Bible I'd never I just never kept track of it so I

00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:50.639
can't tell you how many times I've read through the Bible but it's not enough I

00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:55.959
read it every day every day I want more of it I want more of it I want more of

00:25:55.959 --> 00:26:01.880
it there are plenty of books that I've read once and I've never opened them

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.559
again plenty there are some that I've opened and I've never finished maybe

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:13.160
some of you can relate there are a handful of books that I have reread

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.799
that I've said you know what this is a good book it's a good reminder this is

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:21.239
something that I need to add to my annual reading list I have a couple of

00:26:21.239 --> 00:26:25.600
books like that but there's no book that even comes close to how often I read

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.479
this book Clarence Sexton said don't get your theology from some textbook get it

00:26:31.479 --> 00:26:37.119
from the Bible that's a good truth and I'm thankful for the books that people

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:41.720
have written I'm thankful for the information that is out there but if I

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.320
spend too much time reading that and not enough time reading this I'm in trouble

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.399
I need the Bible and so we're continually making that progress notice

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:57.359
what he says in verse number 11 and we desire you see this desire on the part

00:26:57.359 --> 00:27:02.160
of the spiritual leader for the the followers to continue and to make that

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.440
progress I mentioned as we started this warning passage in Hebrews 5 in verse

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.839
number 11 when the writer said of whom we have many things to say and hard to

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:16.679
be uttered seeing your dull of hearing it wasn't that the teacher had a hard

00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:21.320
time giving the truth it was that the teacher understood the student wasn't

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:27.839
ready for it they were dull of hearing and as we understand the the heart and

00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:34.039
the concern of the spiritual leader to give truth to fulfill the Great

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:38.799
Commission not only to preach the gospel and to baptize but to teach them all

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:46.279
things and we understand here that he says we desire that every one of you do

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:51.880
show notice what he says the same diligence to the full assurance of hope

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.880
unto the end now that's a lot of truth in there and the reality is that we

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.600
ought to as we understand this truth of continuing and this expectation to

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:09.600
continue that we find that we're to continue notice unto the end until you're

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.320
taken to glory you ought to be growing in your Christian walk amen every day

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:24.880
you ought to be growing we never arrive we make progress day by day I've said

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.119
often over the years that you're as close to God today as you really want to

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:34.760
be the one that is the youngest spiritually in our midst could be the

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:41.760
most spiritual in our midst we ought to be making progress every day and you

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.719
notice these as we desire that anyone every one of you notice what he says do

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:50.479
show the same diligence he says in verse number 12 that you be not slothful you

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:54.399
put those thoughts together and you understand there's a purpose that the

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:59.039
individual has if you read the book of Psalms and it's a wonderful encouraging

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:02.279
thing as you read through all of the Psalms but something that you'll notice

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:05.760
as you read through the book of Psalms that oftentimes you find these

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:12.000
statements of the psalmist I will I will I will and they're these purposed

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.960
statements of some things that the psalmist says he's going to do and the

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.239
importance as we understand our lives that we have this diligence that we're

00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:27.239
not slothful that we understand listen there's some effort that we need to put

00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:32.520
into this thing of growing spiritually I remember when I was a kid and I I

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.000
remember so I don't even know who it was some probably my brother because he's

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.679
always trying to tell a story but somebody was talking about how you could

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:45.719
sleep on a on a textbook and by osmosis you would just get the stuff right how

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:49.679
like that's a really good idea you know what it's not true right I mean it just

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:55.359
doesn't work but but the reality is that if I want to grow in my walk with Christ

00:29:55.359 --> 00:30:03.359
I gotta put some effort into it if you want any relationship to grow

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:05.939
you've got to put effort into it.

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:08.119
There's got to be an investment.

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:10.919
If I want my marriage to be what it needs to be,

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:13.499
if our relationship is going to be what it needs to be,

00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:16.139
I need to be making some investment,

00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:19.379
some purposed investment in our relationship.

00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:21.299
If I want relationship with my kids

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:23.539
and I want that to be what it ought to be,

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:24.939
I need to invest in it.

00:30:24.939 --> 00:30:28.539
I need to purpose in that relationship.

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:30.659
I'm thankful that I have a relationship with God

00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:31.579
that is constant.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:34.019
He's my Father and I am His child

00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:35.659
and what a blessing that is.

00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:37.899
When we think about the truth of fellowship

00:30:37.899 --> 00:30:39.619
in our walk with God,

00:30:39.619 --> 00:30:42.319
we need to invest in it.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:44.819
We need to spend time, right?

00:30:44.819 --> 00:30:46.659
You know what the greatest investment is

00:30:46.659 --> 00:30:48.439
that you can make in your relationships

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:51.679
with your spouse and with your children is time.

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:56.539
One of the early presidents of the United States of America,

00:30:58.099 --> 00:31:00.979
he took a day to go and spend with his son

00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:02.499
and to go fishing.

00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:04.739
Both of them took journals.

00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:08.379
It was a daily routine in their lives

00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:11.099
to have journal and to journal through things.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:13.219
And the president of the United States after that day

00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:17.659
said, went fishing with my boy, a day wasted.

00:31:20.419 --> 00:31:21.899
That's what he said.

00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:25.699
On the very same day in the journal of the son,

00:31:25.699 --> 00:31:30.159
went fishing with my dad, best day of my life.

00:31:31.219 --> 00:31:32.979
Does that give you some perspective?

00:31:34.099 --> 00:31:35.619
Time.

00:31:35.619 --> 00:31:37.899
It takes time to read the Bible.

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:40.419
It takes time to pray.

00:31:40.419 --> 00:31:41.679
It just does.

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:47.179
My dad, years ago, I think it was in 1998,

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:48.499
I was a senior in high school

00:31:48.499 --> 00:31:50.539
and I remember he was given a devotion

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:52.779
in our church in California

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:54.659
to the men at a men's prayer breakfast

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:56.379
and I remember him using an illustration

00:31:56.379 --> 00:31:58.859
of a book that he saw.

00:31:58.859 --> 00:31:59.979
I don't think he bought it,

00:31:59.979 --> 00:32:02.099
but it was a book that he saw at a Christian bookstore

00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:04.579
and it said how to pray in nine minutes

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:06.899
and 59 seconds or less.

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:10.819
And it was just this idea of this fast-paced society, right?

00:32:10.819 --> 00:32:12.459
And he used his illustration,

00:32:12.459 --> 00:32:15.059
really in the negative context of the illustration.

00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:15.879
Why?

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:18.019
Because we need to labor in prayer.

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.379
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

00:32:20.379 --> 00:32:24.899
availeth much, our God hears and answers prayer.

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.699
And we find that there's this investment.

00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:28.539
He says, continue unto the end.

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:32.059
I think about this truth, run your race.

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:33.939
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

00:32:33.939 --> 00:32:36.299
we have as our theme, verse number two,

00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:38.939
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

00:32:38.939 --> 00:32:40.599
but we find that in verse number one

00:32:40.599 --> 00:32:42.059
of Hebrews chapter number 12,

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:44.619
it says, wherefore seeing also we are compassed about

00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:46.419
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:49.179
let us lay aside every weight and the sin

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:50.779
which doth so easily beset us

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:54.619
and let us run with patience the race

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:55.739
that is set before us.

00:32:55.779 --> 00:32:59.219
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

00:32:59.219 --> 00:33:01.099
who for the joy that was set before him

00:33:01.099 --> 00:33:03.219
endured the cross, despising the shame,

00:33:03.219 --> 00:33:07.939
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:33:07.939 --> 00:33:09.339
We need to run our race.

00:33:09.339 --> 00:33:12.219
Faithful unto the end.

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:14.419
Some have said over the years,

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:18.899
they didn't start well, but they finished well.

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.679
I like that.

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:22.179
I wanna finish well.

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:24.579
I wanna be able to say, as Paul said,

00:33:24.579 --> 00:33:26.659
I finished my course.

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:28.899
But you know, that didn't happen by accident.

00:33:28.899 --> 00:33:30.739
If you study the life of Paul,

00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:32.819
and you were to look at 2 Timothy chapter number four

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:33.739
in verses seven and eight,

00:33:33.739 --> 00:33:36.499
when he says to Timothy, his son in the faith,

00:33:36.499 --> 00:33:39.019
the time of my departure's at hand.

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:41.819
And he says, I have finished my course.

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:45.659
If you look back in chapter number 20 of the book of Acts,

00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:47.259
and you see as the apostle Paul

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:49.859
is speaking to the Ephesian elders,

00:33:49.939 --> 00:33:54.939
he says to them that I might finish my course with joy.

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:57.779
It was a desire that Paul had.

00:33:58.859 --> 00:34:03.859
He didn't just end up finishing strong or finishing well.

00:34:03.859 --> 00:34:06.059
He purposed to finish well.

00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:10.499
There's some decisions he had to make along the way

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:14.459
to accomplish that which he set out to accomplish.

00:34:14.459 --> 00:34:19.139
So thankful that God helps us along the way.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.539
We think about this expectation to continue,

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:25.059
and we find that it was to continue unto the end.

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:26.779
But we also notice in verse number 12,

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:30.219
look what he says, that ye be not slothful, notice this,

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:35.219
but followers of them who through faith and patience

00:34:35.299 --> 00:34:38.500
inherit the promises.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.539
Now, we find that he talks about here,

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:43.339
but be followers of them.

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:44.299
Who's them?

00:34:44.299 --> 00:34:47.579
Who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:50.219
You know, there are many examples for us to follow.

00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:55.019
In fact, as we look at this thought of faith and patience

00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:57.459
that is listed here, in just a few chapters,

00:34:57.459 --> 00:34:59.899
you're gonna come to Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:01.859
We often speak of Hebrews chapter number 11

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:04.619
as being a hall of faith chapter.

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.500
By faith, this one did this.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500
By faith, this one did this, right?

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.019
And you find you get to the end of the chapter,

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:13.219
and he says, we don't have enough time.

00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:17.139
And so he just kind of wraps up quickly a number of things.

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:19.299
The people that he's going to reference,

00:35:19.299 --> 00:35:22.099
but you find that in Hebrews chapter number 11,

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:24.899
he said there's some examples to follow.

00:35:24.899 --> 00:35:29.619
Who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:32.059
I think about the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:33.939
We've mentioned him often today.

00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:35.299
He said to the believers in Corinth,

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:39.219
be followers of me, even so as I am of the Lord.

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:43.299
See, the Apostle Paul followed the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:43.299 --> 00:35:46.539
And therefore, he could say, be followers of me.

00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:48.859
He wasn't trying to get a group of people

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:51.059
to follow him and start his own thing.

00:35:51.059 --> 00:35:54.739
No, he was saying, I can be an example for you.

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:58.619
We find that he says in Philippians in chapter number four,

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.659
in verse number nine, with regard to the admonition

00:36:02.659 --> 00:36:04.779
to the believers in Philippi,

00:36:04.779 --> 00:36:06.819
he says those things which you have both learned

00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:09.939
and received and heard, but then he says this,

00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:13.819
and seen in me, do.

00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:16.659
The God of peace shall be with you.

00:36:18.019 --> 00:36:20.339
It's interesting as I think about the many examples

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:23.459
that we have to follow, and I think about this truth

00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:26.219
in Hebrews chapter number six in verse number 12.

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:27.939
He talks about but followers of them

00:36:27.939 --> 00:36:30.739
who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:33.179
The reality is that if you stay within the context

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:35.979
of the book of Hebrews and you come to the final chapter

00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:38.659
in chapter number 13 in verse number seven,

00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:43.619
I want you to notice what is said with regard to one group,

00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:46.979
at least of folks that ought to be a good example to follow.

00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:49.059
He says in verse number seven of Hebrews 13,

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:51.819
remember them which have the rule over you,

00:36:51.819 --> 00:36:54.899
who have spoken unto you the word of God.

00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:58.339
Notice this, whose faith follow,

00:36:59.459 --> 00:37:02.099
considering the end of their conversation,

00:37:02.099 --> 00:37:05.619
their lifestyle, their behavior, whose faith follow.

00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:08.419
The one being spoken of in Hebrews 13 in verse number seven

00:37:08.419 --> 00:37:12.699
is the spiritual leader, the pastor if you will,

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:14.779
that they have spoken unto you the word of God

00:37:14.779 --> 00:37:16.539
and whose faith follow.

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:19.859
You know, it ought to be that the message of the lips

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:22.339
matches the message of the life.

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:23.939
Or maybe I should say that the other way around,

00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:25.019
that the message of our life

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:27.779
matches the message of our lips.

00:37:29.019 --> 00:37:32.899
Solomon said, my son, give me thine heart

00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:37.219
and let thine eyes observe my ways.

00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:39.579
Now we know that Solomon wasn't a great example.

00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:42.659
You study his life and of course many errors in his life.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.859
Though he had great wisdom.

00:37:44.859 --> 00:37:47.339
And the reality today is that we find

00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:50.299
that he speaks about this at the end of Hebrews 13

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:53.219
about the example and whose faith follow.

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:55.859
It's interesting if you couple this truth

00:37:55.859 --> 00:37:58.899
with the challenge that the Apostle Paul gave to Timothy

00:37:58.899 --> 00:38:01.899
in first Timothy in verse number 12 of the fourth chapter,

00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:06.019
he says that you're to be an example of the believers.

00:38:06.979 --> 00:38:09.939
Why didn't he tell Timothy to be an example?

00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:11.459
Whose faith follow.

00:38:11.459 --> 00:38:12.859
Timothy was gonna be in that place

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:14.859
of being a spiritual leader.

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:19.379
And he said, Timothy, you're an example to these believers.

00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:23.619
And we think about this passage of scripture,

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:26.219
things that accompany salvation.

00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:30.619
See, there are, there should be in your life

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:32.339
evidences of conversion.

00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:34.539
There should be.

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:36.859
We can examine ourselves and say,

00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:40.299
are there any evidences in my life that I belong to Christ?

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.179
No, we're not gonna be perfect.

00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:44.700
We understand that.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.659
But there ought to be some signs of life spiritually.

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:51.739
There ought to be some birthmarks of a believer.

00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:55.019
And then there's an expectation to continue.

00:38:55.019 --> 00:38:57.179
That we continue to walk with God.

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:00.140
We see that he speaks about continuing unto the end.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.579
We see that he speaks about the example follow,

00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:07.140
to be followers of them who through faith and patience

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.140
inherit the promises.

00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:13.140
And I wonder this morning as we conclude our message,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.419
we've mentioned several that are examples for us to follow.

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:18.859
But I wonder and I would ask you,

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:20.419
I've asked myself the question

00:39:20.419 --> 00:39:22.099
and I want you to ask yourself the question

00:39:22.099 --> 00:39:23.899
this morning as well.

00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:27.619
Who can look at your life as an example to follow?

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:33.380
Is there someone that you could say,

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.099
as Paul did, be followers of me?

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:41.260
That you would so closely follow the Lord Jesus Christ

00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:45.059
that your life would be worth,

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:48.419
that would be that example that would be worth following.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.739
I hope that you can say yes.

00:39:52.339 --> 00:39:56.059
Many times in life in various venues and settings,

00:39:56.059 --> 00:40:00.219
I have observed individuals, parents to be specific,

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:03.219
who are embarrassed by some of the behavior.

00:40:03.219 --> 00:40:08.599
of their children. Have you? And sometimes the parent that's embarrassed says something

00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:15.799
like this, I have no idea where they learned that. And you just kind of chuckle and say,

00:40:15.799 --> 00:40:21.699
hmm, I got a pretty good idea where they probably learned that. What do children do? They follow

00:40:21.699 --> 00:40:28.939
the examples. Spiritually speaking, we're to be an example. There's some people, some

00:40:28.939 --> 00:40:35.259
examples that we can follow. And we ought to be an example for others to follow. And

00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:39.259
it doesn't always have to be somebody that's younger. Because spiritually speaking, the

00:40:39.259 --> 00:40:48.079
youngest again among us can be the most spiritual and can be one of the best examples. Amen?

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:55.599
And so this morning, things that accompany salvation, are there evidences of conversion?

00:40:55.599 --> 00:41:01.439
You need to know that for yourself. Examine yourself. Am I in the faith? Yes, I've been

00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:07.439
born again. And there are evidences of conversion in my life. And then there's this expectation

00:41:07.439 --> 00:41:12.239
to continue. Don't give up. Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:18.319
persecution. There are times in which it's tough. The devil's fighting and he's attacking.

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:24.359
So we're going to continue. We're going to be faithful until the end. Not in my own power,

00:41:24.479 --> 00:41:29.599
but in the power of Christ in me. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:34.679
us. Thank You for the Word of God and the truth that's contained therein. We thank You

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:40.799
for this passage of Scripture that gives us these things that accompany salvation. The

00:41:40.799 --> 00:41:47.799
evidences specifically in the text, the labor, the service of Your people and the love, love

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:53.359
for God, love for the brethren. God, I pray that those that are watching online, those

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:58.119
that are gathered here at the church house, Lord, that we would be able to say there are

00:41:58.119 --> 00:42:04.119
evidences in our lives of conversion. However, we understand that there might be one among

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:09.719
us or one that's watching that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:14.599
God, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation. They would not leave

00:42:14.599 --> 00:42:21.039
this place without knowing for sure that heaven is their home. And Father, I pray that even

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.959
as we see the expectation to continue that You would help us, Lord, to keep our eyes

00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:31.479
upon Jesus, that we would run our race, that we would be faithful unto the end, that we

00:42:31.479 --> 00:42:35.039
would consider the examples of those that have gone before us and that, God, we would

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:39.679
be an example for those that would follow. Use us, Lord, for Your honor and for Your

00:42:39.679 --> 00:42:44.479
glory. We'll thank You for the work that You'll do in our lives. For it's in Christ's name

00:42:44.479 --> 00:42:48.679
we pray. We will have a moment of invitation. Stand with me. Kimberly's going to play on

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:54.719
the piano. You can make your own pew, your altar. If you want to come up here, you can.

00:42:54.719 --> 00:42:58.839
Try to be careful, of course, with all of those things and at home, those that are watching,

00:42:58.839 --> 00:43:02.839
make your living room or wherever it is that you're watching your altar this morning. But

00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:07.279
if the Spirit of God spoke to your heart today, the altar is open as Kimberly plays.
