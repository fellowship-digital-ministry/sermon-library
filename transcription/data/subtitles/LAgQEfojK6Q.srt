1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,219
As he's writing to these believers in this region of Galatia. He said this in Galatians 2 in verse number 20

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:08,220
I am crucified with Christ

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,659
Nevertheless, I live yet not high but Christ liveth in me

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,000
He says this in the life, which I now live in the flesh

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,760
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
for me

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,979
the Apostle Paul said to the believers in Corinth and second Corinthians 5 in verse number 15 and that he died for all that

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,779
They which live should not henceforth live unto themselves

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:37,200
But unto him which died for them and rose again

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,779
I'm so thankful for the privilege of living for Jesus and giving our heart to him

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,259
Colossians chapter number two this morning if you have your Bible there with you

12
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:51,099
Colossians chapter number two, I will be preaching through the book of Colossians this year

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,220
But as you know, if you've been here for any length of time each year

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,319
I choose an annual theme for our church as I seek the Lord for direction

15
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,699
I ask him and I desire of him to provide me with direction

16
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,239
That will lead me to a theme that will encourage

17
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,720
strengthen and

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,239
Challenge the members and attenders of Fellowship Baptist Church. It's hard to believe but it's true

19
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,239
nonetheless that this is

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:28,139
Entering now into our tenth year of being the pastor here at Fellowship Baptist Church and we came in August of

21
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:29,819
2011 and

22
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,940
each

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,260
Calendar year that we have had the privilege and opportunity to serve as the pastor of this great church

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,860
We've had a theme in

25
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,379
2012 our theme was standing on his promises

26
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:49,000
We sing the song about standing on the promises and we had as our theme in

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,239
2012 standing on his promises and we had the privilege

28
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:58,559
During that particular calendar year to study on Sunday mornings. It was certainly more of a topical

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Study and we went through and we studied

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,880
various promises from the Word of God and I'm so thankful that our God has given us exceeding great and precious

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,199
promises as Peter said it and

32
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:19,539
What a joy it is to be mindful of the promises of God and to claim the promises of God in

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,419
2013 I preached through the book of Esther and the theme for that year was for such a time as

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,820
This for such a time as this and as we had the opportunity and privilege

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,380
To preach through the book of Esther and we understood that God gives us opportunity and how we must seize that opportunity in

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,380
2014 I preached to the book of John and

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,759
Dealt with that great statement of John the Baptist in John 3 in verse number 30. He must increase

38
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,320
It's all about Jesus and we understand that the entirety of that

39
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:58,880
thought in that verse as he must increase and I must decrease and so we taught through preached through the book of

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,080
John in

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,720
2015

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
boldness to speak thy word

43
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:10,839
This was part one of the book of Acts and we studied through the first 12 chapters the book of Acts in

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,779
2015 and

45
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:19,419
We saw how that the disciples of the Apostles there the early church how they faced much opposition and much

46
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,179
difficulty and they faced threats and

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,940
Imprisonment and beatings and all sorts of things that they endured and how they prayed that God would grant them

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Boldness to speak thy word and how we

49
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:39,600
understand even still today how we need the boldness of the Holy Spirit of God to speak the Word of God in

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
2016 we finished up the book of Acts

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,160
We picked up in Acts 13 and went through the end of the book and we taught and had our theme that year. I

52
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,559
believe God

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,059
How important it is and that we would stand as Paul did in Acts 27 and make that declaration

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
I believe God and

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,199
We see throughout the latter part of the book of Acts the way in which the missionary journeys in the church

56
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,639
The gospel went forward. What a blessing in

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,859
2017 increase our faith another one of those topical type of studies as we went through the year the calendar year of

58
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,600
2017 really we focused upon those things that God would give us in his word

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,200
that would be as I often referred to it that year as faith builders and

60
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,100
How God would increase our faith the disciples said to the Lord Jesus

61
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,899
During his earthly ministry. They said Lord increase our faith and we to

62
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,940
Understand that it's important that we live by faith. We understand the Word of God says without faith

63
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,380
It is impossible to please him

64
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:51,140
but he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him the just shall live by

65
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,500
faith and

66
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,679
We're to walk by faith live by faith and so we throughout

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
2017 focused upon those

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:05,239
Various truths of the Word of God that would cause us to have our faith increased in 2018

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
counter blessings

70
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:11,679
the psalmist said he daily loatheth me with benefits and

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,880
I believe that each of us could echo the words of the psalmist and say in our hearts and lives today

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,640
That he has daily loatheth us with benefits God has been so good to us

73
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,140
And it's important that we count our blessings. We understand the song count your blessings name them one by one and

74
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,420
it will surprise you what the Lord hath done and

75
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:40,540
so often we can find ourselves in a natural state of complaining or murmuring and looking at the

76
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,799
Circumstances and the adversities that we face but how we must focus our attention upon counting our

77
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:54,720
blessings in 2019 be strong in the Lord and I taught preached through the book of Ephesians and how important it is that we

78
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,839
Understand that we're engaged in spiritual warfare and that spiritual battle

79
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,859
continues to rage even today and how we must put on the whole armor of God and we must be strong in the Lord in

80
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:13,040
the power of his might and I had the privilege of teaching and preaching through the book of Ephesians last year as I

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,420
Mentioned in the beginning of our service this morning

82
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,660
The book of Hebrews what a great book Christ is better

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,720
He's superior better than what better than anything better than everything. He's superior. He's better and

84
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:34,559
We understand that as we study through the book of Hebrews and had that as our thought our theme looking unto Jesus from the 12th chapter

85
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,019
Of the book of Hebrews and how important it is for us as the people of God

86
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,859
To not be focused so much upon the circumstances of life

87
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,779
But to have our eyes upon our Savior to look to Jesus

88
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:53,260
The author and finish of our faith that we would lift up our eyes unto the hills from whence cometh our help

89
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,059
Understanding and knowing with assurance that our help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth

90
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:03,420
I'm so thankful for the truth

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
of that theme and how it encouraged and

92
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,760
strengthened and challenged me personally last year and

93
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,320
this year

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,880
complete in Christ

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,920
complete in Christ in Colossians 2 in verse number 10 the Apostle Paul and we're going right in the middle of a

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,239
Discussion that he's having with these believers in the in Colossi and the Bible says and ye are

97
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,980
Complete in him which is the head of all

98
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,019
principality and

99
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:43,339
Power Lord willing and with the help of the Lord we will study through the book of Colossians this year

100
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,760
We will not start this morning in Colossians 1, but we will

101
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,619
Go through exegetically through the book of Colossians and study verse by verse

102
00:07:52,179 --> 00:08:00,059
But this morning we will consider this statement from this verse of Scripture as we will use it for our theme for this calendar

103
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,559
year in

104
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,880
2021 we understand that as the Word of God says you're complete in him

105
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,399
We've used as our theme complete in Christ

106
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,600
The hymn is very obvious that it's Christ

107
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,480
If you look back in verse number 5 the Bible says for though I be absent in the flesh

108
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:24,320
Yet am I with you in the Spirit joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness notice of your faith in Christ as

109
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:29,019
Ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord

110
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:35,099
So walk ye in him and who in Christ Jesus the Lord

111
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:40,619
rooted and built up in him who's him Jesus Christ and

112
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,820
Established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving

113
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,940
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit

114
00:08:53,479 --> 00:09:00,840
After their tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ

115
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:08,119
for in him Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,640
ye are

117
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,159
complete in

118
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:18,719
Him Christ, which is the head of all principality and power

119
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,280
complete in Christ

120
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,340
This morning as we study and kind of share our heart and the theme for this year

121
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,219
I would just ask a few questions by way of delivering this message this morning

122
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:37,500
And so if you're taking notes, the first question is this what does it mean to be complete in him?

123
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,619
What does it mean when the Apostle Paul says to these believers in Colossae and ye are?

124
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,559
Complete in him when we have as our theme for all of this calendar year

125
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,380
2021

126
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,000
Complete in Christ when you walk into the sanctuary and you see on the banners

127
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:59,900
Complete in Christ when you look in your Bible and you have your bookmark and it says complete in Christ

128
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,980
when you look at your church calendar,

129
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,600
when you go to our website

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,820
and you see this thought of complete in Christ,

131
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,100
and we ask ourselves this question,

132
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
what does it mean to be complete in Him?

133
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,820
What does it mean to be complete in Christ?

134
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,940
Well, we'd have to answer that question

135
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,640
by going all the way back to the book of Genesis.

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
In Genesis chapter number one,

137
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
if you take a moment and hold your place there

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
in the book of Colossians

139
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,940
and turn back to the book of Genesis, if you will,

140
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,140
and obviously on Sunday evenings,

141
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,760
I am preaching and teaching through the book of Genesis

142
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,600
and we're made our way to the 17th chapter.

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,340
And so we've made some progress

144
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,720
over the last couple of years

145
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,640
studying through the book of Genesis.

146
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,260
And here we find in Genesis one in verse number 27,

147
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,220
the Bible says this,

148
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,600
so God created man in his own image.

149
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,340
In the image of God created he him,

150
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,900
male and female created he them.

151
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,180
We understand the truth of creation.

152
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,940
We've spent much time developing

153
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,860
the teaching of the word of God.

154
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,300
And we've said often that the truth

155
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,100
and the teaching of creation

156
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,340
is not isolated to the book of Genesis.

157
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,480
You find the truth of creation

158
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,380
all throughout the word of God.

159
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,360
And we understand that we are created in the image of God.

160
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,200
What does that mean?

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,460
Well, we understand that God is the Trinity,

162
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,660
we use that word, the triunity,

163
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,740
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.

164
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,340
These three are one, the triunity or the Trinity

165
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,020
as we would refer to it as.

166
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,140
And we'd understand that as man has been made

167
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,540
in the image of God,

168
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,260
that we as human beings, we are a trichotomy.

169
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,260
And what we mean by that is we are body, soul and spirit.

170
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,740
When God made Adam and God made Eve,

171
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,220
he made them in the image of God.

172
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,580
They had a body, a soul and a spirit.

173
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,420
They were made perfect.

174
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,200
And we find that the Bible tells us

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,040
as we would look just a few chapters later

176
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,580
in Genesis chapter number three,

177
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,340
that sin entered into the world.

178
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,820
We understand that God had given a simple command.

179
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,380
And he said to Adam in verse number 16

180
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,860
of Genesis chapter number two,

181
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,860
and the Lord God commanded the man saying,

182
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,740
of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.

183
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,780
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

184
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,620
thou shalt not eat of it.

185
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,420
For in the day that thou eatest thereof,

186
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,720
thou shalt surely die.

187
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,220
In Genesis chapter number three,

188
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,580
the serpent, Satan himself,

189
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,860
enters the pages of Scripture.

190
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,580
And the Bible tells us in Genesis three

191
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,860
in verse number one,

192
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,480
now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

193
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,640
which the Lord God had made.

194
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,860
And he said unto the woman,

195
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,820
yea, hath God said,

196
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,140
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.

197
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,060
And we understand I will not take time

198
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,900
to go through the entirety of the passage.

199
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,660
But the Bible tells us in verse number six,

200
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,980
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food

201
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,460
and that it was pleasant to the eyes

202
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,380
and a tree to be desired to make one wise,

203
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,120
she took the fruit thereof and did eat

204
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,120
and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat.

205
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,460
The Bible says that the eyes of them both were open

206
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,340
that they knew that they were naked

207
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,300
and they sewed fig leaves together

208
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,280
and made themselves aprons.

209
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,820
Now God is not a liar.

210
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,540
He's not a man that he should lie.

211
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,700
And he said in verse 17 of Genesis two,

212
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,420
that in the day that thou eatest thereof,

213
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,440
thou shalt surely die.

214
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,780
But we understand as we follow

215
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,180
and trace the pages of Scripture,

216
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,260
that Adam and Eve did not die physically

217
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,780
on that particular day.

218
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,980
They died spiritually.

219
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,900
And we'd understand that the Bible tells us

220
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
that death entered into the world.

221
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,820
And if we leave the pages of Scripture

222
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,580
here in Genesis chapter number three,

223
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,900
and we go over to Romans chapter number five,

224
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,580
and we find that the Bible tells us in Romans five

225
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,860
in verse number 12,

226
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,980
wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world

227
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,060
and death by sin,

228
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,060
and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned.

229
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,500
Now at the birth of the children of Adam and Eve

230
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,100
and all other human beings that have ever been born

231
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,660
upon the face of this earth,

232
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
apart from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

233
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,140
have been born with a sin nature.

234
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,640
We have still body, soul, and spirit,

235
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,100
but we are dead in our sins and our trespasses.

236
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,060
The Bible tells us this truth

237
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,540
as we look at the book of Ephesians.

238
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,620
Notice with me in Ephesians chapter number two,

239
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,580
as Paul is writing to these believers in Ephesus

240
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,380
and dealing with this thought

241
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,300
of being dead in our trespasses and sins,

242
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,900
we'd understand this morning

243
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,180
that lost individuals are dead spiritually.

244
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,260
The Bible says in verse number one of Ephesians two,

245
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,420
and you have he quickened

246
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,060
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

247
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,820
And so quicken, that means to make alive.

248
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,720
And we understand that as saved people,

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,260
we've been born again,

250
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,820
and therefore we would be complete in Christ,

251
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,540
but we'd understand as we look at this truth of Scripture

252
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,860
that lost people,

253
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,780
if Paul is saying to these folks in Colossae

254
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,140
that you're complete in him,

255
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,780
then we would understand it's possible to be incomplete.

256
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,620
Amen?

257
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,620
It's a pretty simple thought, a pretty simple truth,

258
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,460
but if someone says that that's complete,

259
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,400
I have completed the puzzle,

260
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,940
I put the last piece in the puzzle,

261
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,540
that means it was incomplete until that piece was put in.

262
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,900
And as human beings, if we are not saved,

263
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,980
we are incomplete.

264
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,100
We have body, soul, and our spirit is dead.

265
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,980
We are dead in our sins and our trespasses.

266
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,700
In fact, it is this very truth

267
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,100
that God used to convince and convict my dad

268
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
of his need for a savior.

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,140
It was a man that was sharing the gospel

270
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,980
with another coworker, and he said this,

271
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,260
there are a number of people in this earth,

272
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,500
there are a number of people that are living,

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,780
but they are dead, walking around,

274
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,900
and they're just waiting to die.

275
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,260
And he used this terminology

276
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,420
and he went through this whole thing,

277
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,000
and my dad understood at that particular time

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,180
that he was alive physically, but dead spiritually,

279
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,040
and he was going to die a physical death at some point,

280
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,200
but of course, he was dead in his trespasses and sins.

281
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,720
Now, if we understand this thought of being complete in him,

282
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,160
we'd ask the question, what does it mean

283
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,520
to be complete in him, to be complete in Christ?

284
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,280
It means that we'd be born again.

285
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,520
Do you remember the words of Jesus to Nicodemus

286
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,160
in John chapter number three,

287
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
and verse number three and verse number seven?

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,920
And I just got it straight what the man said,

289
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,000
there are a lot of dead people walking around

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,680
that are just waiting to die.

291
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,800
And that was the exact quote that the man used,

292
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,600
it was the witnessing to the coworker,

293
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,760
my dad heard that, a lot of dead people

294
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,520
walking around waiting to die,

295
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,720
dead spiritually waiting to die a physical death.

296
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
But Jesus said this to Nicodemus,

297
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,960
we know that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night,

298
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
and Jesus said to Nicodemus in verse number three

299
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,880
of John three, verily, verily, I say unto you,

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,920
I say unto thee, excuse me,

301
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,800
except a man be born again,

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,400
he cannot see the kingdom of God.

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,040
And then he says in verse number seven,

304
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,320
marvel not that I said unto thee,

305
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,680
ye must be born again.

306
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,440
The word complete in Colossians two in verse number 10,

307
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,040
the verse that we're using as our theme verse for this year,

308
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,360
if you turn back to that portion of Scripture

309
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
of Colossians, the word complete means to fill to the full,

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,640
to cause one to abound.

311
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,480
I like this statement or this definition

312
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,360
of this word complete,

313
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,000
to make complete in every particular,

314
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,880
to render perfect, to render perfect.

315
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,180
And so we've answered the question,

316
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,440
what does it mean to be complete in Him?

317
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
We then ask this question, number two,

318
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,280
if you're taking notes this morning,

319
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,360
why did Paul tell them, these folks in Colossae,

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
why did he tell them that they were complete in Him?

321
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Very simply stated, because they had been born again.

322
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
Turn back, if you will, to Colossians one,

323
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,160
and notice with me in verse number two,

324
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,600
how Paul would address these folks in Colossae.

325
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
The Bible says in verse number one,

326
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,559
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,

327
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,280
and Timotheus, our brother.

328
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,880
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,

329
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,480
which are at Colossae.

330
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,119
You understand that in verse number two,

331
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,680
that Paul would refer to these individuals

332
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,960
that he's writing to in the book of Colossians,

333
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,760
these individuals in the city of Colossae,

334
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,920
that they are saints and faithful brethren in Christ.

335
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,000
A saint, as we've mentioned in times gone by,

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,680
is one who is in Christ, in whom Christ dwells.

337
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,240
And you will find that throughout the Scriptures,

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,720
there are many books of the Bible

339
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,800
that are addressed to the saints in Ephesus,

340
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,760
the saints here in Colossae.

341
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,320
And we find that they notice, as the Bible continues,

342
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,680
notice with me in verse number four,

343
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
it says this,

344
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,520
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

345
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,559
and of the love which you have to all the saints.

346
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,680
We read already in verse number five of Colossians two,

347
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,559
where the Bible says at the last statement of that verse.

348
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,999
the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. And so we find that these

349
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,999
recipients of this book, if we were to understand this morning, the book of

350
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:13,079
Colossians is being written to believers, is being written to those that have been

351
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,119
born again, those that have been saved, and that is why the Apostle Paul is saying

352
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,719
to them in Colossians 2 and verse number 10, and ye are complete in him. We

353
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:27,199
understand what it means to be complete in him, and we understand why Paul would

354
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:32,439
tell them that they are complete in him, is because they've been saved, they've

355
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,819
been born again. Back in the book of Ephesians, as we've referenced Ephesians

356
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:42,559
2 and verse number 1, the fact that you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

357
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,399
and you hath he quickened who were dead in your trespasses and sins. In Ephesians

358
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:52,799
2 and verse number 4, the Bible says, but God who is rich in mercy for his great

359
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,039
love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us

360
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:07,199
together with Christ. By grace you're saved, and hath raised us up together and

361
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,720
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the

362
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,639
ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness

363
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,839
toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, and

364
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,720
that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.

365
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,639
For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God

366
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:44,879
hath before ordained that we should walk in them. We understand there's only one

367
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:50,000
way to be saved, and that's through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. We sing a

368
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,079
song, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way. And we understand

369
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,919
this morning that Jesus himself proclaimed, find the way, the truth, and

370
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,399
the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. We understand that Peter, as he

371
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:09,559
stands up there in Acts chapter number 4, and as they're being questioned about

372
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,559
the man that was healed in Acts chapter number 3, and all the stir and uproar

373
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,239
that was taking place because of that great miracle, that Peter stands up and

374
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:23,319
he testifies and he says there's no other name under heaven given among men

375
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,720
whereby we must be saved. What is that name? That's the precious name of Jesus.

376
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,959
And these believers here in Colossae, they had been saved by the blood of

377
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:39,720
Jesus Christ, they had been quickened, they had been made alive, and therefore

378
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:50,199
Paul is saying to them, ye are complete in him. You're complete in him. Not really

379
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:55,279
a third point, but a question that we'd ask at this point in the message this

380
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:05,759
morning, are you complete in him? Have you been born again? Could it be said of you?

381
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,199
I mean, would be a possible... we understand that all Scripture is given

382
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:14,839
by inspiration of God. Paul was the human penman that was used to write the book

383
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,759
of Colossians, but really we find that it's the Word of God, and God is saying

384
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,319
to these believers that you are complete. Why? Because you're a believer, because

385
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,720
you've trusted Christ. These individuals in Colossae, they're saved, they've been

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,000
born again, and this morning, are you complete in Christ? Have you been born

387
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,039
again? Have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? I'm not

388
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,759
asking if you know about him. I'm not asking if you know some truth from

389
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,000
the Word of God. I'm not asking if you can recite some things, and some words,

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,119
and some maybe even quote some verses of Scripture. I'm asking this morning, has

391
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,880
there been a time in your life, has there been a day in your life where you

392
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,039
understood that you were a sinner, that you were incomplete, that you were dead

393
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:04,479
spiritually, that there was a great price for that sin, and that's death. The

394
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:10,360
second death, as the Bible says, in the lake of fire. You understand that Jesus

395
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,119
Christ, because of the love of God, died in your place. He went to that cruel

396
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:23,720
cross. He bled and he died. He was buried in a borrowed tomb. He rose in victory,

397
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:29,600
conquering sin, death, and the grave. And the Bible says, for whosoever shall call

398
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,359
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. There was a time in your life when you

399
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:44,079
said, I understand that I'm a sinner. I understand that there's a penalty for

400
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,799
breaking the law of God. I understand that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ,

401
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,200
died for me. And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at

402
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,919
Calvary. And you were born again. You may not remember the exact date. I seek to

403
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,600
encourage those that God has allowed me to minister to, and to lead them to a

404
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,000
saving knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to remember the date in

405
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,239
which they trusted Christ, the date in which they were born again. I encourage

406
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,399
people in that thought or that way because I was encouraged in that way. And

407
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:28,239
so I remember that it was on August 31st, in the year 1997, when I placed my faith

408
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:33,440
and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. And I'm so thankful that on

409
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,399
that day, I was made alive. So thankful that on that day, I was born again. And I

410
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,559
didn't understand that that day on that moment, I didn't understand all that that

411
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,279
meant. But I understand as I read the scriptures, and I understand that as we

412
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,559
look specifically at this truth this morning, from this thought in Colossians

413
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:03,679
2, that I am complete in Him, in Christ. What a joy. What a blessing. This morning,

414
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,919
if you say, I'm not complete. I've never trusted Jesus Christ as my personal

415
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,839
Savior. I'm incomplete. Yes, we've been made body, soul, and spirit, but I've

416
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,160
never been born again. I'm dead in my trespasses and sins. Can I tell you this

417
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,160
morning that Jesus saves. We sing about it. We proclaim the message. In fact, as

418
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,239
we preached and taught through the book of Hebrews, we're mindful of that truth

419
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:32,480
in Hebrews 7, in verse number 25, where the Bible says, wherefore He is able also

420
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,399
to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to

421
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,760
make intercession for them. He is the Savior of the world. We sang this morning,

422
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,200
what a wonderful Savior, and He is. The songwriter said, He's a wonderful Savior

423
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,160
to me. It's another song in our hymnal that we sing. He's a wonderful Savior to

424
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,959
me, and as we think about the truth and the thought of these two great hymns of

425
00:26:55,959 --> 00:27:01,559
the faith, the reality is that I can say from a personal perspective that He,

426
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:08,160
Jesus, is a wonderful Savior, and that He is my Savior. He's a wonderful Savior to

427
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,679
me. This morning, if you can't say that, if you don't have that peace and that

428
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:21,600
confidence, can I tell you this morning that He wants to save you. He loves you, and

429
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,399
He wants to save you, and you can be born again today. Would you trust Christ? We've

430
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,839
asked two questions. Number one, what does it mean to be complete in Him? Number two,

431
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,519
why did Paul tell them, these folks, these individuals in Colossae, that they

432
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,000
were complete in Him? Because they had been born again. Finally, this morning I

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,320
would ask this question, how should this truth impact you? How should this truth

434
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:01,200
impact the believers in Colossae? Again, as we will throughout this calendar year

435
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,559
study through the book of Colossians, beginning in Colossians 1.1 in our next

436
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,959
message, and going all the way through the end of the fourth chapter, it's not a

437
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:13,480
very long book, but we will make our way through the book of Colossians in this

438
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,000
calendar year, and it will probably take us most of the year to get through the

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,639
book, but as we find and as we will spend time at a later date studying in great

440
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:29,600
detail the second chapter of the book of Colossians, I want you to notice how the

441
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,840
second chapter of the book of Colossians begins. It says this in verse number one,

442
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:43,039
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at

443
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:50,080
Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. So Paul reveals

444
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,239
to these believers that he's writing to in Colossians 2 in verse number one, that

445
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:58,719
he has a great conflict for them and for the believers in Laodicea, as we find in

446
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:02,559
verse number one, and he's not yet seen them. We'll mention that as we study

447
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,679
through the book about the relationship between Paul and these believers and so

448
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,320
on and so forth, but as we go through and begin to study the second chapter, and

449
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,039
I'll just make a couple of statements this morning on understanding how this

450
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,960
truth should impact you, how it would impact these believers in Colossae, I

451
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,960
want you to understand that Paul is saying to them, as we've mentioned

452
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,760
already in verse number six, notice in Colossians 2 in verse 6, as ye have

453
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,119
therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. We've often used

454
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,479
this verse of Scripture to say, listen, if you've been born again, if you've

455
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:40,239
received Christ Jesus the Lord, you're to walk in him. In fact, as we studied

456
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:45,679
through the book of Ephesians a couple of years ago in 2019, we had the

457
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,520
opportunity to look at our position in Christ and then how that position

458
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,919
in Christ impacts our walk with him. And of course, there in the book of Ephesians,

459
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,559
there are several different aspects in which...

460
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,019
Paul addresses the believers in Ephesus about their walk.

461
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,859
And here in Colossians, he tells these believers,

462
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,979
you've received Christ Jesus the Lord,

463
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,519
so walk ye in Him.

464
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,099
Notice what he says in verse 7.

465
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:18,819
Rooted and built up in Him,

466
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,599
and established in the faith as you have been taught,

467
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,939
abounding therein with thanksgiving.

468
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:27,559
And what a great picture

469
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,759
of what the Christian life is supposed to look like.

470
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:35,679
That we are rooted and built up in Him.

471
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
That we are established in the faith.

472
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,759
That we're not tossed to and fro

473
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,639
with every wind of doctrine.

474
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:47,099
That we're not easily influenced by the false teachers

475
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:50,599
that are so prevalent in the day in which we live.

476
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,599
We understand as we would study the book of 2 Timothy,

477
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,219
as we'd study the book of 2 Peter,

478
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:59,059
as we'd look through various portions of the New Testament,

479
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,559
we'd understand that the Bible reveals to us

480
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,559
that there will be false teachers.

481
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,279
There are false teachers.

482
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,059
And Peter says, just as there were false prophets

483
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:12,559
in the Old Testament,

484
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,559
there would be false teachers

485
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,559
in the age that we refer to often as the church age.

486
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,479
And we see it to be true.

487
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,519
We do not have to be tossed to and fro

488
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,319
with every wind of doctrine.

489
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,360
We can be this picture that is seen in verse 7,

490
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
that we are rooted and built up in Him.

491
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,659
Established in the faith.

492
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,360
Notice, as you have been taught,

493
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,659
it reminds us of the importance of teaching the Word of God.

494
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,360
It reminds us of the importance of discipleship.

495
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,659
The Great Commission.

496
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,159
That we're to go into all the world

497
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,860
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

498
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,360
But the Bible tells us that we're to see Him saved

499
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
and see Him baptized and then see Him discipled.

500
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,860
That we would teach them all things

501
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,360
whatsoever I have commanded you.

502
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,360
That's what Jesus said in Matthew 28.

503
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
And as we would consider the importance

504
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
of discipleship and teaching,

505
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
that people, the people of God

506
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,360
would be grounded and settled and rooted and built up.

507
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,860
Then notice verse 8.

508
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,360
Paul says, beware.

509
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,860
Now it's interesting to me,

510
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,860
whenever you see a warning label

511
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
on some product that you purchase,

512
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,860
a sign on some road that you're traveling,

513
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
on some gate that you're seeking to enter,

514
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,360
there will be warning signs.

515
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,860
Beware of dogs is a sign that you may see

516
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,360
as you would enter into someone's gate.

517
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,860
You ought to take heed to that warning.

518
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,360
Beware. Danger ahead.

519
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,860
As you're driving, there's a curve,

520
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
there's a this, whatever it might be.

521
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,360
Out west, beware of falling rocks.

522
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Many places you can drive out west

523
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,860
and rocks will just fall onto the highway.

524
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
You need to be careful.

525
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
In the pages of Scripture,

526
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,860
God gives us some warnings.

527
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Could I tell you this morning that it's important

528
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,360
that we take heed to the warnings

529
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,860
that God gives us in His Word?

530
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,360
And here's where we find really

531
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,360
the impact of this truth.

532
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
He says, beware,

533
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,860
lest any man spoil you

534
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,360
through philosophy and vain deceit.

535
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,360
After the tradition of men,

536
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,860
after the rudiments of the world,

537
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,860
and not after Christ.

538
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Can I tell you, as we note here

539
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,360
in this text of Scripture

540
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,860
that these believers were being hit

541
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,360
with philosophy and deceit and tradition,

542
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
they're given this warning in v. 8.

543
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,860
Beware, lest any man spoil you

544
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,360
through these processes.

545
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,860
And we'll study as we deal with Colossians 2

546
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,360
in greater detail at a future time.

547
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,860
We'll discuss some of the things

548
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
that were prevalent during this particular time

549
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,360
in this particular region.

550
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,860
Some of the false teaching

551
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
that would be influential,

552
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,360
possibly influential,

553
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,860
in the lives of these individuals.

554
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,360
And Paul is warning them

555
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,360
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

556
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,860
And he's warning them,

557
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,360
and then he's encouraging them.

558
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,860
It says, for in Him dwelleth

559
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,360
all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

560
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,860
In who? In Christ.

561
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,859
Dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

562
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,359
In other words,

563
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,359
we don't have to look for anywhere else,

564
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,859
anything else in Him in Christ.

565
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:26,359
Dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

566
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:29,359
And the continuation in v. 10,

567
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,859
ye are complete in Him,

568
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:38,359
which is the head of all principality and power.

569
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:41,359
And so as we understand the warning in v. 8

570
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,359
and the encouragement in v. 9-10,

571
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,359
specifically in v. 10,

572
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,859
the thought that we've used for our theme this year

573
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,859
that we are complete in Christ,

574
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,359
that you're complete in Him,

575
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,859
we would say this,

576
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,359
that this truth would impact us.

577
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,359
It would give us a peace.

578
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:58,359
It would give us a rest.

579
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,859
I'm complete in Him.

580
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,859
These philosophies and this vain deceit

581
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,859
and these traditions,

582
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,859
I don't need to get caught up in those things.

583
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,859
I don't need to get twisted up

584
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,359
and sideways over those things.

585
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,859
No, I understand my position in Christ.

586
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,359
I understand that I'm complete in Him.

587
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,859
The reality is that lost people,

588
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,859
those that are not complete,

589
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:26,859
we said in the beginning of our message

590
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,859
that if He's saying you're complete in Him,

591
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,359
then it's obviously possible to be incomplete

592
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,859
and that would be a lost person.

593
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,859
Can I tell you that we have witnessed,

594
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,359
we have observed, in fact,

595
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:42,359
some of us even that got saved later in life

596
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,859
tried to fill that void with something else.

597
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,359
Because we knew we were incomplete.

598
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:53,359
And we see, we observe people

599
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,359
that try to fill that void,

600
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,359
that emptiness with something.

601
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,859
And they find that nothing ever satisfies.

602
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:09,859
That nothing gives you that completeness.

603
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:10,859
Why?

604
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,859
Because the only thing,

605
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,859
the only person that satisfies,

606
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:19,859
the only person that can bring that completeness

607
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,859
is Christ.

608
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:23,859
It would not work to go back

609
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,859
to the illustration that we used

610
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,859
in the beginning of the message this morning

611
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:29,859
about that 500 piece puzzle

612
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,359
that you get to number 499

613
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,859
and there's one piece missing.

614
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,359
And you've looked high and low,

615
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,359
you've searched everywhere,

616
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,859
you cannot find it.

617
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:41,359
It would not work to simply go find

618
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,359
a piece from a puzzle in the closet

619
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,359
from some other puzzle

620
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:48,859
and try to force it in.

621
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,359
No.

622
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,859
It's not going to work.

623
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,359
You need that piece

624
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,859
that specifically goes to that puzzle.

625
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,359
In fact, there are times in which

626
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,359
our family has set up a table

627
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,359
and would work on a puzzle.

628
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,859
And there are times in which

629
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,859
I would jokingly go by and say to Holly,

630
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,359
oh, that piece goes right here.

631
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,359
And you could try to force it as much as you want,

632
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,359
but if it's not the right piece,

633
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,859
it's not going to work.

634
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:24,359
And if we could use that simple illustration

635
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,859
and example this morning

636
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,859
and put it to a spiritual truth

637
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:32,859
that we find here in the book of Colossians,

638
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,859
only Jesus satisfies.

639
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,359
The only way to be complete

640
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,359
is in Christ.

641
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,359
You're not going to find

642
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,359
completeness in riches,

643
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,359
in wealth or fame,

644
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:52,359
in possessions,

645
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:54,359
in position.

646
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,359
No.

647
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,859
Those things leave man wanting

648
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,359
because nothing will satisfy like Jesus.

649
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,859
See, this is how God designed it.

650
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,359
Remember, we're a trichotomy.

651
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,859
Body, soul, and spirit.

652
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:15,859
Because of sin, there's death.

653
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:19,359
And the spirit needs to be quickened.

654
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,859
The only way for that to take place

655
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:24,359
is through the blood of Christ.

656
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,359
And this morning, as I understand

657
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:31,359
the things that these believers

658
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,859
in Colossae would face,

659
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:34,359
and even the things in which

660
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:38,859
the believers throughout the ages would face,

661
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,359
that we understand this morning

662
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,359
our place and our position in Christ.

663
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,359
That we'd understand there's nothing else that I need.

664
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,359
That I find my acceptance in Him, in Christ.

665
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,359
That I find and understand this morning

666
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,859
that I am complete in Him.

667
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,359
It gives me a peace

668
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:00,859
that passeth all understanding.

669
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,859
It gives me a rest

670
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,359
that is almost beyond description.

671
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:12,359
This morning, as we think about the subject of peace,

672
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,359
we understand that there's only one way

673
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,359
to make peace with God.

674
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,359
According to Romans 5, in verse 1,

675
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
therefore being justified by faith,

676
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,859
we have peace with God

677
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,359
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

678
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,859
It's good for us to have peace with God,

679
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,859
but there's only one way to have peace with God

680
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,359
is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

681
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,859
Salvation.

682
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:37,359
And these believers are being encouraged.

683
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,359
Ye are complete in Him.

684
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,859
Oh, you've made peace with God

685
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:45,359
and now you have the peace of God

686
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,359
that passeth all understanding.

687
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:54,359
This morning, this year, in 2021,

688
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,359
as we are reminded throughout the year,

689
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,859
complete in Him, complete in Christ,

690
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,859
as we sing the theme song...

691
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:09,899
complete in thee, that we'd understand that our identity and our acceptance is

692
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:17,539
in Christ. Many times in life people seek to describe themselves, to identify

693
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,419
themselves, and I wonder as the people of God, you know the best way for us to

694
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:27,059
understand our identity first and foremost is that we are children of God.

695
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:34,259
I'm a child of the King, the songwriter said, and what a joy to know the Lord

696
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:40,939
Jesus Christ is our personal Savior. And this morning, if you've been saved, I

697
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:45,739
would say to you that you are complete in Him, but I would challenge you this

698
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:51,619
morning to allow that truth to impact how you live daily, to understand that

699
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:57,979
your acceptance, that your identity is not found in people, positions,

700
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:05,699
possessions, wealth, status. No, no, I'm complete in Him, and I can have a peace

701
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:14,259
and a rest because I understand my acceptance in Christ. That we would not

702
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:22,619
be influenced by philosophy, vain deceit, tradition, the rudiments of the world, as

703
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,499
the Bible says there in verse number eight, that we would be rooted and built

704
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:33,659
up in Him, understanding that we're complete in Him. This morning, if you've

705
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:38,219
never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I would say to you

706
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:43,419
this morning that today is the day of salvation. That's what Paul said. We

707
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:49,859
understand that our life is but a vapor. We understand the wise man said in

708
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:57,179
Proverbs that we know not what a day would bring forth. Paul said today is the

709
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,499
day of salvation. And if you've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your

710
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:05,459
personal Savior, in the same thought of this message this morning, I would say to

711
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:13,379
you that you're incomplete. You need to be saved. And if you would trust Christ

712
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:20,659
as your Savior today, you would be complete in Him, complete in Christ. What

713
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:26,219
a joy, what a blessing. I look forward with great excitement and anticipation to

714
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:30,819
preaching and teaching through the book of Colossians this year. I trust that God

715
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:37,739
would use the study through this great book to encourage, strengthen, and

716
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:43,979
challenge each and every one of us. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you

717
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:49,859
for loving us. We thank you so much for the Word of God and for the truth

718
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:56,779
contained therein. We thank you that you have given us all things that pertain

719
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:04,219
unto life and godliness. We thank you that as believers, as the children of God,

720
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:11,379
that we can understand that we are complete in thee. God, I pray that this

721
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:20,659
Bible truth would have a profound impact on every believer within our congregation.

722
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:27,339
Father, I pray that if there'd be one under the sound of my voice that's never

723
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:34,499
trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, I pray that today would

724
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:38,379
be the day of their salvation. I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would

725
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:44,419
convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come. I

726
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:52,859
pray, God, that they would get it settled and then understand that because of

727
00:43:52,859 --> 00:44:00,339
their salvation, they too would be complete in Christ. Would you have your

728
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:06,299
will and way over these next few moments of invitation? Work as only you can, and

729
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:11,259
we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
