00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.219
As he's writing to these believers in this region of Galatia. He said this in Galatians 2 in verse number 20

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:08.220
I am crucified with Christ

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.659
Nevertheless, I live yet not high but Christ liveth in me

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.000
He says this in the life, which I now live in the flesh

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.760
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
for me

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.979
the Apostle Paul said to the believers in Corinth and second Corinthians 5 in verse number 15 and that he died for all that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.779
They which live should not henceforth live unto themselves

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:37.200
But unto him which died for them and rose again

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.779
I'm so thankful for the privilege of living for Jesus and giving our heart to him

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.259
Colossians chapter number two this morning if you have your Bible there with you

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:51.099
Colossians chapter number two, I will be preaching through the book of Colossians this year

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.220
But as you know, if you've been here for any length of time each year

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.319
I choose an annual theme for our church as I seek the Lord for direction

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:05.699
I ask him and I desire of him to provide me with direction

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.239
That will lead me to a theme that will encourage

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.720
strengthen and

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.239
Challenge the members and attenders of Fellowship Baptist Church. It's hard to believe but it's true

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.239
nonetheless that this is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.139
Entering now into our tenth year of being the pastor here at Fellowship Baptist Church and we came in August of

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:29.819
2011 and

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:30.940
each

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.260
Calendar year that we have had the privilege and opportunity to serve as the pastor of this great church

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
We've had a theme in

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.379
2012 our theme was standing on his promises

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.000
We sing the song about standing on the promises and we had as our theme in

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.239
2012 standing on his promises and we had the privilege

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:58.559
During that particular calendar year to study on Sunday mornings. It was certainly more of a topical

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.000
Study and we went through and we studied

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.880
various promises from the Word of God and I'm so thankful that our God has given us exceeding great and precious

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.199
promises as Peter said it and

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:19.539
What a joy it is to be mindful of the promises of God and to claim the promises of God in

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.419
2013 I preached through the book of Esther and the theme for that year was for such a time as

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.820
This for such a time as this and as we had the opportunity and privilege

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.380
To preach through the book of Esther and we understood that God gives us opportunity and how we must seize that opportunity in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.380
2014 I preached to the book of John and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.759
Dealt with that great statement of John the Baptist in John 3 in verse number 30. He must increase

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.320
It's all about Jesus and we understand that the entirety of that

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:58.880
thought in that verse as he must increase and I must decrease and so we taught through preached through the book of

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.080
John in

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.720
2015

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720
boldness to speak thy word

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:10.839
This was part one of the book of Acts and we studied through the first 12 chapters the book of Acts in

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.779
2015 and

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:19.419
We saw how that the disciples of the Apostles there the early church how they faced much opposition and much

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.179
difficulty and they faced threats and

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.940
Imprisonment and beatings and all sorts of things that they endured and how they prayed that God would grant them

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.720
Boldness to speak thy word and how we

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:39.600
understand even still today how we need the boldness of the Holy Spirit of God to speak the Word of God in

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.800
2016 we finished up the book of Acts

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.160
We picked up in Acts 13 and went through the end of the book and we taught and had our theme that year. I

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.559
believe God

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.059
How important it is and that we would stand as Paul did in Acts 27 and make that declaration

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
I believe God and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.199
We see throughout the latter part of the book of Acts the way in which the missionary journeys in the church

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.639
The gospel went forward. What a blessing in

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.859
2017 increase our faith another one of those topical type of studies as we went through the year the calendar year of

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.600
2017 really we focused upon those things that God would give us in his word

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.200
that would be as I often referred to it that year as faith builders and

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.100
How God would increase our faith the disciples said to the Lord Jesus

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.899
During his earthly ministry. They said Lord increase our faith and we to

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:41.940
Understand that it's important that we live by faith. We understand the Word of God says without faith

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.380
It is impossible to please him

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:51.140
but he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him the just shall live by

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.500
faith and

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:56.679
We're to walk by faith live by faith and so we throughout

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320
2017 focused upon those

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:05.239
Various truths of the Word of God that would cause us to have our faith increased in 2018

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760
counter blessings

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:11.679
the psalmist said he daily loatheth me with benefits and

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.880
I believe that each of us could echo the words of the psalmist and say in our hearts and lives today

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.640
That he has daily loatheth us with benefits God has been so good to us

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.140
And it's important that we count our blessings. We understand the song count your blessings name them one by one and

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.420
it will surprise you what the Lord hath done and

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.540
so often we can find ourselves in a natural state of complaining or murmuring and looking at the

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:46.799
Circumstances and the adversities that we face but how we must focus our attention upon counting our

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:54.720
blessings in 2019 be strong in the Lord and I taught preached through the book of Ephesians and how important it is that we

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.839
Understand that we're engaged in spiritual warfare and that spiritual battle

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:05.859
continues to rage even today and how we must put on the whole armor of God and we must be strong in the Lord in

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:13.040
the power of his might and I had the privilege of teaching and preaching through the book of Ephesians last year as I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.420
Mentioned in the beginning of our service this morning

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.660
The book of Hebrews what a great book Christ is better

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.720
He's superior better than what better than anything better than everything. He's superior. He's better and

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:34.559
We understand that as we study through the book of Hebrews and had that as our thought our theme looking unto Jesus from the 12th chapter

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.019
Of the book of Hebrews and how important it is for us as the people of God

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.859
To not be focused so much upon the circumstances of life

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.779
But to have our eyes upon our Savior to look to Jesus

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:53.260
The author and finish of our faith that we would lift up our eyes unto the hills from whence cometh our help

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.059
Understanding and knowing with assurance that our help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:03.420
I'm so thankful for the truth

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.040
of that theme and how it encouraged and

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:11.760
strengthened and challenged me personally last year and

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.320
this year

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.880
complete in Christ

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.920
complete in Christ in Colossians 2 in verse number 10 the Apostle Paul and we're going right in the middle of a

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.239
Discussion that he's having with these believers in the in Colossi and the Bible says and ye are

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.980
Complete in him which is the head of all

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.019
principality and

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:43.339
Power Lord willing and with the help of the Lord we will study through the book of Colossians this year

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.760
We will not start this morning in Colossians 1, but we will

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.619
Go through exegetically through the book of Colossians and study verse by verse

00:07:52.179 --> 00:08:00.059
But this morning we will consider this statement from this verse of Scripture as we will use it for our theme for this calendar

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:01.559
year in

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:05.880
2021 we understand that as the Word of God says you're complete in him

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.399
We've used as our theme complete in Christ

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:11.600
The hymn is very obvious that it's Christ

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.480
If you look back in verse number 5 the Bible says for though I be absent in the flesh

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:24.320
Yet am I with you in the Spirit joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness notice of your faith in Christ as

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:29.019
Ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:35.099
So walk ye in him and who in Christ Jesus the Lord

00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:40.619
rooted and built up in him who's him Jesus Christ and

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.820
Established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.940
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit

00:08:53.479 --> 00:09:00.840
After their tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ

00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:08.119
for in him Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.640
ye are

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.159
complete in

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:18.719
Him Christ, which is the head of all principality and power

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:21.280
complete in Christ

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.340
This morning as we study and kind of share our heart and the theme for this year

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.219
I would just ask a few questions by way of delivering this message this morning

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:37.500
And so if you're taking notes, the first question is this what does it mean to be complete in him?

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.619
What does it mean when the Apostle Paul says to these believers in Colossae and ye are?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.559
Complete in him when we have as our theme for all of this calendar year

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.380
2021

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.000
Complete in Christ when you walk into the sanctuary and you see on the banners

00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:59.900
Complete in Christ when you look in your Bible and you have your bookmark and it says complete in Christ

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.980
when you look at your church calendar,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.600
when you go to our website

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.820
and you see this thought of complete in Christ,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.100
and we ask ourselves this question,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.100
what does it mean to be complete in Him?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.820
What does it mean to be complete in Christ?

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.940
Well, we'd have to answer that question

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.640
by going all the way back to the book of Genesis.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.480
In Genesis chapter number one,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480
if you take a moment and hold your place there

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.520
in the book of Colossians

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.940
and turn back to the book of Genesis, if you will,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.140
and obviously on Sunday evenings,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.760
I am preaching and teaching through the book of Genesis

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.600
and we're made our way to the 17th chapter.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.340
And so we've made some progress

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.720
over the last couple of years

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.640
studying through the book of Genesis.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.260
And here we find in Genesis one in verse number 27,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.220
the Bible says this,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.600
so God created man in his own image.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.340
In the image of God created he him,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.900
male and female created he them.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.180
We understand the truth of creation.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.940
We've spent much time developing

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.860
the teaching of the word of God.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.300
And we've said often that the truth

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.100
and the teaching of creation

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.340
is not isolated to the book of Genesis.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.480
You find the truth of creation

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.380
all throughout the word of God.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.360
And we understand that we are created in the image of God.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.200
What does that mean?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.460
Well, we understand that God is the Trinity,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.660
we use that word, the triunity,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.740
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.340
These three are one, the triunity or the Trinity

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.020
as we would refer to it as.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.140
And we'd understand that as man has been made

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.540
in the image of God,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.260
that we as human beings, we are a trichotomy.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And what we mean by that is we are body, soul and spirit.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.740
When God made Adam and God made Eve,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.220
he made them in the image of God.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.580
They had a body, a soul and a spirit.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.420
They were made perfect.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.200
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.040
as we would look just a few chapters later

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.580
in Genesis chapter number three,

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.340
that sin entered into the world.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.820
We understand that God had given a simple command.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.380
And he said to Adam in verse number 16

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.860
of Genesis chapter number two,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.860
and the Lord God commanded the man saying,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.740
of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.780
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.620
thou shalt not eat of it.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.420
For in the day that thou eatest thereof,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.720
thou shalt surely die.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.220
In Genesis chapter number three,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.580
the serpent, Satan himself,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.860
enters the pages of Scripture.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.580
And the Bible tells us in Genesis three

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.860
in verse number one,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.480
now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.640
which the Lord God had made.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.860
And he said unto the woman,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.820
yea, hath God said,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.140
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.060
And we understand I will not take time

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.900
to go through the entirety of the passage.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.660
But the Bible tells us in verse number six,

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.980
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.460
and that it was pleasant to the eyes

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.380
and a tree to be desired to make one wise,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.120
she took the fruit thereof and did eat

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.120
and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.460
The Bible says that the eyes of them both were open

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.340
that they knew that they were naked

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.300
and they sewed fig leaves together

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.280
and made themselves aprons.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.820
Now God is not a liar.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.540
He's not a man that he should lie.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.700
And he said in verse 17 of Genesis two,

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.420
that in the day that thou eatest thereof,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.440
thou shalt surely die.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.780
But we understand as we follow

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.180
and trace the pages of Scripture,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.260
that Adam and Eve did not die physically

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.780
on that particular day.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.980
They died spiritually.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.900
And we'd understand that the Bible tells us

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.700
that death entered into the world.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.820
And if we leave the pages of Scripture

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.580
here in Genesis chapter number three,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.900
and we go over to Romans chapter number five,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.580
and we find that the Bible tells us in Romans five

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.860
in verse number 12,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.980
wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.060
and death by sin,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.060
and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.500
Now at the birth of the children of Adam and Eve

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.100
and all other human beings that have ever been born

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.660
upon the face of this earth,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.660
apart from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.140
have been born with a sin nature.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.640
We have still body, soul, and spirit,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.100
but we are dead in our sins and our trespasses.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.060
The Bible tells us this truth

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.540
as we look at the book of Ephesians.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.620
Notice with me in Ephesians chapter number two,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.580
as Paul is writing to these believers in Ephesus

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.380
and dealing with this thought

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.300
of being dead in our trespasses and sins,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.900
we'd understand this morning

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.180
that lost individuals are dead spiritually.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.260
The Bible says in verse number one of Ephesians two,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.420
and you have he quickened

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.060
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.820
And so quicken, that means to make alive.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.720
And we understand that as saved people,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.260
we've been born again,

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.820
and therefore we would be complete in Christ,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.540
but we'd understand as we look at this truth of Scripture

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.860
that lost people,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.780
if Paul is saying to these folks in Colossae

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.140
that you're complete in him,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.780
then we would understand it's possible to be incomplete.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.620
Amen?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.620
It's a pretty simple thought, a pretty simple truth,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.460
but if someone says that that's complete,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.400
I have completed the puzzle,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.940
I put the last piece in the puzzle,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.540
that means it was incomplete until that piece was put in.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.900
And as human beings, if we are not saved,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.980
we are incomplete.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.100
We have body, soul, and our spirit is dead.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.980
We are dead in our sins and our trespasses.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.700
In fact, it is this very truth

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.100
that God used to convince and convict my dad

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.900
of his need for a savior.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.140
It was a man that was sharing the gospel

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.980
with another coworker, and he said this,

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.260
there are a number of people in this earth,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.500
there are a number of people that are living,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.780
but they are dead, walking around,

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.900
and they're just waiting to die.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.260
And he used this terminology

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.420
and he went through this whole thing,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.000
and my dad understood at that particular time

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.180
that he was alive physically, but dead spiritually,

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.040
and he was going to die a physical death at some point,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.200
but of course, he was dead in his trespasses and sins.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.720
Now, if we understand this thought of being complete in him,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.160
we'd ask the question, what does it mean

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.520
to be complete in him, to be complete in Christ?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.280
It means that we'd be born again.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.520
Do you remember the words of Jesus to Nicodemus

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.160
in John chapter number three,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
and verse number three and verse number seven?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.920
And I just got it straight what the man said,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.000
there are a lot of dead people walking around

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.680
that are just waiting to die.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.800
And that was the exact quote that the man used,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.600
it was the witnessing to the coworker,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.760
my dad heard that, a lot of dead people

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.520
walking around waiting to die,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.720
dead spiritually waiting to die a physical death.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.760
But Jesus said this to Nicodemus,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.960
we know that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.960
and Jesus said to Nicodemus in verse number three

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.880
of John three, verily, verily, I say unto you,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.920
I say unto thee, excuse me,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.800
except a man be born again,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.400
he cannot see the kingdom of God.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.040
And then he says in verse number seven,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.320
marvel not that I said unto thee,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.680
ye must be born again.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.440
The word complete in Colossians two in verse number 10,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.040
the verse that we're using as our theme verse for this year,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.360
if you turn back to that portion of Scripture

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.400
of Colossians, the word complete means to fill to the full,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.640
to cause one to abound.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.480
I like this statement or this definition

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.360
of this word complete,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.000
to make complete in every particular,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.880
to render perfect, to render perfect.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.180
And so we've answered the question,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.440
what does it mean to be complete in Him?

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.640
We then ask this question, number two,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.280
if you're taking notes this morning,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.360
why did Paul tell them, these folks in Colossae,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.880
why did he tell them that they were complete in Him?

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.200
Very simply stated, because they had been born again.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.280
Turn back, if you will, to Colossians one,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.160
and notice with me in verse number two,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.600
how Paul would address these folks in Colossae.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.840
The Bible says in verse number one,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.559
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.280
and Timotheus, our brother.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.880
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.480
which are at Colossae.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.119
You understand that in verse number two,

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:09.680
that Paul would refer to these individuals

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.960
that he's writing to in the book of Colossians,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.760
these individuals in the city of Colossae,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.920
that they are saints and faithful brethren in Christ.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.000
A saint, as we've mentioned in times gone by,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.680
is one who is in Christ, in whom Christ dwells.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.240
And you will find that throughout the Scriptures,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.720
there are many books of the Bible

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.800
that are addressed to the saints in Ephesus,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.760
the saints here in Colossae.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.320
And we find that they notice, as the Bible continues,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.680
notice with me in verse number four,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.520
it says this,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.520
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.559
and of the love which you have to all the saints.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.680
We read already in verse number five of Colossians two,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.559
where the Bible says at the last statement of that verse.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:05.999
the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. And so we find that these

00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:09.999
recipients of this book, if we were to understand this morning, the book of

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:13.079
Colossians is being written to believers, is being written to those that have been

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:17.119
born again, those that have been saved, and that is why the Apostle Paul is saying

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:22.719
to them in Colossians 2 and verse number 10, and ye are complete in him. We

00:20:22.719 --> 00:20:27.199
understand what it means to be complete in him, and we understand why Paul would

00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:32.439
tell them that they are complete in him, is because they've been saved, they've

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:36.819
been born again. Back in the book of Ephesians, as we've referenced Ephesians

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:42.559
2 and verse number 1, the fact that you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:47.399
and you hath he quickened who were dead in your trespasses and sins. In Ephesians

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:52.799
2 and verse number 4, the Bible says, but God who is rich in mercy for his great

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:59.039
love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:07.199
together with Christ. By grace you're saved, and hath raised us up together and

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:13.720
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:19.639
ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness

00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:24.839
toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, and

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:29.720
that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:37.639
For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:44.879
hath before ordained that we should walk in them. We understand there's only one

00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:50.000
way to be saved, and that's through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. We sing a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.079
song, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way. And we understand

00:21:56.079 --> 00:22:00.919
this morning that Jesus himself proclaimed, find the way, the truth, and

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:05.399
the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. We understand that Peter, as he

00:22:05.399 --> 00:22:09.559
stands up there in Acts chapter number 4, and as they're being questioned about

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:14.559
the man that was healed in Acts chapter number 3, and all the stir and uproar

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:19.239
that was taking place because of that great miracle, that Peter stands up and

00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:23.319
he testifies and he says there's no other name under heaven given among men

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:28.720
whereby we must be saved. What is that name? That's the precious name of Jesus.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.959
And these believers here in Colossae, they had been saved by the blood of

00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:39.720
Jesus Christ, they had been quickened, they had been made alive, and therefore

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:50.199
Paul is saying to them, ye are complete in him. You're complete in him. Not really

00:22:50.199 --> 00:22:55.279
a third point, but a question that we'd ask at this point in the message this

00:22:55.279 --> 00:23:05.759
morning, are you complete in him? Have you been born again? Could it be said of you?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.199
I mean, would be a possible... we understand that all Scripture is given

00:23:10.199 --> 00:23:14.839
by inspiration of God. Paul was the human penman that was used to write the book

00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:18.759
of Colossians, but really we find that it's the Word of God, and God is saying

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:22.319
to these believers that you are complete. Why? Because you're a believer, because

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:26.720
you've trusted Christ. These individuals in Colossae, they're saved, they've been

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.000
born again, and this morning, are you complete in Christ? Have you been born

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:36.039
again? Have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? I'm not

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:41.759
asking if you know about him. I'm not asking if you know some truth from

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:46.000
the Word of God. I'm not asking if you can recite some things, and some words,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.119
and some maybe even quote some verses of Scripture. I'm asking this morning, has

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:53.880
there been a time in your life, has there been a day in your life where you

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.039
understood that you were a sinner, that you were incomplete, that you were dead

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:04.479
spiritually, that there was a great price for that sin, and that's death. The

00:24:04.479 --> 00:24:10.360
second death, as the Bible says, in the lake of fire. You understand that Jesus

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:17.119
Christ, because of the love of God, died in your place. He went to that cruel

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:23.720
cross. He bled and he died. He was buried in a borrowed tomb. He rose in victory,

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:29.600
conquering sin, death, and the grave. And the Bible says, for whosoever shall call

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:37.359
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. There was a time in your life when you

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:44.079
said, I understand that I'm a sinner. I understand that there's a penalty for

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:49.799
breaking the law of God. I understand that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:55.200
died for me. And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.919
Calvary. And you were born again. You may not remember the exact date. I seek to

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:07.600
encourage those that God has allowed me to minister to, and to lead them to a

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.000
saving knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to remember the date in

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.239
which they trusted Christ, the date in which they were born again. I encourage

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:22.399
people in that thought or that way because I was encouraged in that way. And

00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:28.239
so I remember that it was on August 31st, in the year 1997, when I placed my faith

00:25:28.239 --> 00:25:33.440
and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. And I'm so thankful that on

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:41.399
that day, I was made alive. So thankful that on that day, I was born again. And I

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:45.559
didn't understand that that day on that moment, I didn't understand all that that

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:50.279
meant. But I understand as I read the scriptures, and I understand that as we

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:54.559
look specifically at this truth this morning, from this thought in Colossians

00:25:54.559 --> 00:26:03.679
2, that I am complete in Him, in Christ. What a joy. What a blessing. This morning,

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:09.919
if you say, I'm not complete. I've never trusted Jesus Christ as my personal

00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:14.839
Savior. I'm incomplete. Yes, we've been made body, soul, and spirit, but I've

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:19.160
never been born again. I'm dead in my trespasses and sins. Can I tell you this

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.160
morning that Jesus saves. We sing about it. We proclaim the message. In fact, as

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.239
we preached and taught through the book of Hebrews, we're mindful of that truth

00:26:28.239 --> 00:26:32.480
in Hebrews 7, in verse number 25, where the Bible says, wherefore He is able also

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.399
to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to

00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:41.760
make intercession for them. He is the Savior of the world. We sang this morning,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:47.200
what a wonderful Savior, and He is. The songwriter said, He's a wonderful Savior

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.160
to me. It's another song in our hymnal that we sing. He's a wonderful Savior to

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.959
me, and as we think about the truth and the thought of these two great hymns of

00:26:55.959 --> 00:27:01.559
the faith, the reality is that I can say from a personal perspective that He,

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:08.160
Jesus, is a wonderful Savior, and that He is my Savior. He's a wonderful Savior to

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.679
me. This morning, if you can't say that, if you don't have that peace and that

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:21.600
confidence, can I tell you this morning that He wants to save you. He loves you, and

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.399
He wants to save you, and you can be born again today. Would you trust Christ? We've

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:34.839
asked two questions. Number one, what does it mean to be complete in Him? Number two,

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:40.519
why did Paul tell them, these folks, these individuals in Colossae, that they

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:45.000
were complete in Him? Because they had been born again. Finally, this morning I

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:53.320
would ask this question, how should this truth impact you? How should this truth

00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:01.200
impact the believers in Colossae? Again, as we will throughout this calendar year

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.559
study through the book of Colossians, beginning in Colossians 1.1 in our next

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:08.959
message, and going all the way through the end of the fourth chapter, it's not a

00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:13.480
very long book, but we will make our way through the book of Colossians in this

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.000
calendar year, and it will probably take us most of the year to get through the

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.639
book, but as we find and as we will spend time at a later date studying in great

00:28:23.639 --> 00:28:29.600
detail the second chapter of the book of Colossians, I want you to notice how the

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.840
second chapter of the book of Colossians begins. It says this in verse number one,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:43.039
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:50.080
Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. So Paul reveals

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.239
to these believers that he's writing to in Colossians 2 in verse number one, that

00:28:54.239 --> 00:28:58.719
he has a great conflict for them and for the believers in Laodicea, as we find in

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:02.559
verse number one, and he's not yet seen them. We'll mention that as we study

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:05.679
through the book about the relationship between Paul and these believers and so

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:09.320
on and so forth, but as we go through and begin to study the second chapter, and

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.039
I'll just make a couple of statements this morning on understanding how this

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:17.960
truth should impact you, how it would impact these believers in Colossae, I

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.960
want you to understand that Paul is saying to them, as we've mentioned

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.760
already in verse number six, notice in Colossians 2 in verse 6, as ye have

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.119
therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. We've often used

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:34.479
this verse of Scripture to say, listen, if you've been born again, if you've

00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:40.239
received Christ Jesus the Lord, you're to walk in him. In fact, as we studied

00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:45.679
through the book of Ephesians a couple of years ago in 2019, we had the

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:51.520
opportunity to look at our position in Christ and then how that position

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:57.919
in Christ impacts our walk with him. And of course, there in the book of Ephesians,

00:29:57.919 --> 00:30:02.559
there are several different aspects in which...

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:06.019
Paul addresses the believers in Ephesus about their walk.

00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:09.859
And here in Colossians, he tells these believers,

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:11.979
you've received Christ Jesus the Lord,

00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:13.519
so walk ye in Him.

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:15.099
Notice what he says in verse 7.

00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:18.819
Rooted and built up in Him,

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:22.599
and established in the faith as you have been taught,

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:25.939
abounding therein with thanksgiving.

00:30:25.939 --> 00:30:27.559
And what a great picture

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:31.759
of what the Christian life is supposed to look like.

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:35.679
That we are rooted and built up in Him.

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:38.799
That we are established in the faith.

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:40.759
That we're not tossed to and fro

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:42.639
with every wind of doctrine.

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:47.099
That we're not easily influenced by the false teachers

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:50.599
that are so prevalent in the day in which we live.

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:53.599
We understand as we would study the book of 2 Timothy,

00:30:53.599 --> 00:30:55.219
as we'd study the book of 2 Peter,

00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:59.059
as we'd look through various portions of the New Testament,

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:01.559
we'd understand that the Bible reveals to us

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:04.559
that there will be false teachers.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:08.279
There are false teachers.

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:11.059
And Peter says, just as there were false prophets

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:12.559
in the Old Testament,

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.559
there would be false teachers

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:18.559
in the age that we refer to often as the church age.

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:21.479
And we see it to be true.

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:24.519
We do not have to be tossed to and fro

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:26.319
with every wind of doctrine.

00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:30.360
We can be this picture that is seen in verse 7,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.360
that we are rooted and built up in Him.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.659
Established in the faith.

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:35.360
Notice, as you have been taught,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.659
it reminds us of the importance of teaching the Word of God.

00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:42.360
It reminds us of the importance of discipleship.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.659
The Great Commission.

00:31:43.659 --> 00:31:45.159
That we're to go into all the world

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:46.860
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.360
But the Bible tells us that we're to see Him saved

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.360
and see Him baptized and then see Him discipled.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.860
That we would teach them all things

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.360
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.360
That's what Jesus said in Matthew 28.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.360
And as we would consider the importance

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.360
of discipleship and teaching,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.360
that people, the people of God

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.360
would be grounded and settled and rooted and built up.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.860
Then notice verse 8.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.360
Paul says, beware.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.860
Now it's interesting to me,

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.860
whenever you see a warning label

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.860
on some product that you purchase,

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.860
a sign on some road that you're traveling,

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.860
on some gate that you're seeking to enter,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.360
there will be warning signs.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.860
Beware of dogs is a sign that you may see

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.360
as you would enter into someone's gate.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.860
You ought to take heed to that warning.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.360
Beware. Danger ahead.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.860
As you're driving, there's a curve,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.860
there's a this, whatever it might be.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.360
Out west, beware of falling rocks.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.360
Many places you can drive out west

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.860
and rocks will just fall onto the highway.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.860
You need to be careful.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.860
In the pages of Scripture,

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.860
God gives us some warnings.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.860
Could I tell you this morning that it's important

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.360
that we take heed to the warnings

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.860
that God gives us in His Word?

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.360
And here's where we find really

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.360
the impact of this truth.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360
He says, beware,

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.860
lest any man spoil you

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.360
through philosophy and vain deceit.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.360
After the tradition of men,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.860
after the rudiments of the world,

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860
and not after Christ.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.860
Can I tell you, as we note here

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.360
in this text of Scripture

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.860
that these believers were being hit

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.360
with philosophy and deceit and tradition,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.360
they're given this warning in v. 8.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.860
Beware, lest any man spoil you

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.360
through these processes.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.860
And we'll study as we deal with Colossians 2

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.360
in greater detail at a future time.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.860
We'll discuss some of the things

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.860
that were prevalent during this particular time

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.360
in this particular region.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.860
Some of the false teaching

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.860
that would be influential,

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.360
possibly influential,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.860
in the lives of these individuals.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.360
And Paul is warning them

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.360
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.860
And he's warning them,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.360
and then he's encouraging them.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.860
It says, for in Him dwelleth

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.360
all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.860
In who? In Christ.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.859
Dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:34:18.859 --> 00:34:20.359
In other words,

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.359
we don't have to look for anywhere else,

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:23.859
anything else in Him in Christ.

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:26.359
Dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:34:26.359 --> 00:34:29.359
And the continuation in v. 10,

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:33.859
ye are complete in Him,

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:38.359
which is the head of all principality and power.

00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:41.359
And so as we understand the warning in v. 8

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:43.359
and the encouragement in v. 9-10,

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:45.359
specifically in v. 10,

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:47.859
the thought that we've used for our theme this year

00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:49.859
that we are complete in Christ,

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:51.359
that you're complete in Him,

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:52.859
we would say this,

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:54.359
that this truth would impact us.

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:56.359
It would give us a peace.

00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:58.359
It would give us a rest.

00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:00.859
I'm complete in Him.

00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:03.859
These philosophies and this vain deceit

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:05.859
and these traditions,

00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:07.859
I don't need to get caught up in those things.

00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:09.859
I don't need to get twisted up

00:35:09.859 --> 00:35:11.359
and sideways over those things.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:14.859
No, I understand my position in Christ.

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:18.359
I understand that I'm complete in Him.

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:22.859
The reality is that lost people,

00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:24.859
those that are not complete,

00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:26.859
we said in the beginning of our message

00:35:26.859 --> 00:35:28.859
that if He's saying you're complete in Him,

00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:32.359
then it's obviously possible to be incomplete

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:34.859
and that would be a lost person.

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:36.859
Can I tell you that we have witnessed,

00:35:36.859 --> 00:35:38.359
we have observed, in fact,

00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:42.359
some of us even that got saved later in life

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:47.859
tried to fill that void with something else.

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:50.359
Because we knew we were incomplete.

00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:53.359
And we see, we observe people

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:56.359
that try to fill that void,

00:35:56.359 --> 00:36:00.359
that emptiness with something.

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:04.859
And they find that nothing ever satisfies.

00:36:04.859 --> 00:36:09.859
That nothing gives you that completeness.

00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:10.859
Why?

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:12.859
Because the only thing,

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:15.859
the only person that satisfies,

00:36:15.859 --> 00:36:19.859
the only person that can bring that completeness

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:21.859
is Christ.

00:36:21.859 --> 00:36:23.859
It would not work to go back

00:36:23.859 --> 00:36:25.859
to the illustration that we used

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:27.859
in the beginning of the message this morning

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:29.859
about that 500 piece puzzle

00:36:29.859 --> 00:36:32.359
that you get to number 499

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:34.859
and there's one piece missing.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.359
And you've looked high and low,

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:37.359
you've searched everywhere,

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.859
you cannot find it.

00:36:38.859 --> 00:36:41.359
It would not work to simply go find

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:44.359
a piece from a puzzle in the closet

00:36:44.359 --> 00:36:46.359
from some other puzzle

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:48.859
and try to force it in.

00:36:48.859 --> 00:36:50.359
No.

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:51.859
It's not going to work.

00:36:51.859 --> 00:36:54.359
You need that piece

00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:57.859
that specifically goes to that puzzle.

00:36:57.859 --> 00:36:59.359
In fact, there are times in which

00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:03.359
our family has set up a table

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:05.359
and would work on a puzzle.

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.859
And there are times in which

00:37:06.859 --> 00:37:08.859
I would jokingly go by and say to Holly,

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:12.359
oh, that piece goes right here.

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:16.359
And you could try to force it as much as you want,

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:18.359
but if it's not the right piece,

00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:21.859
it's not going to work.

00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:24.359
And if we could use that simple illustration

00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:27.859
and example this morning

00:37:27.859 --> 00:37:29.859
and put it to a spiritual truth

00:37:29.859 --> 00:37:32.859
that we find here in the book of Colossians,

00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:35.859
only Jesus satisfies.

00:37:35.859 --> 00:37:38.359
The only way to be complete

00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:41.359
is in Christ.

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:44.359
You're not going to find

00:37:44.359 --> 00:37:47.359
completeness in riches,

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:50.359
in wealth or fame,

00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:52.359
in possessions,

00:37:52.359 --> 00:37:54.359
in position.

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:56.359
No.

00:37:56.359 --> 00:37:58.859
Those things leave man wanting

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:02.359
because nothing will satisfy like Jesus.

00:38:02.359 --> 00:38:05.859
See, this is how God designed it.

00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:07.359
Remember, we're a trichotomy.

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:12.859
Body, soul, and spirit.

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:15.859
Because of sin, there's death.

00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:19.359
And the spirit needs to be quickened.

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.859
The only way for that to take place

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:24.359
is through the blood of Christ.

00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:28.359
And this morning, as I understand

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:31.359
the things that these believers

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.859
in Colossae would face,

00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:34.359
and even the things in which

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:38.859
the believers throughout the ages would face,

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:40.359
that we understand this morning

00:38:40.359 --> 00:38:43.359
our place and our position in Christ.

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:46.359
That we'd understand there's nothing else that I need.

00:38:46.359 --> 00:38:51.359
That I find my acceptance in Him, in Christ.

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:54.359
That I find and understand this morning

00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:55.859
that I am complete in Him.

00:38:55.859 --> 00:38:58.359
It gives me a peace

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:00.859
that passeth all understanding.

00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:04.859
It gives me a rest

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:08.359
that is almost beyond description.

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:12.359
This morning, as we think about the subject of peace,

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:14.359
we understand that there's only one way

00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:15.359
to make peace with God.

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:17.359
According to Romans 5, in verse 1,

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:19.359
therefore being justified by faith,

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:21.859
we have peace with God

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:24.359
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:27.859
It's good for us to have peace with God,

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:29.859
but there's only one way to have peace with God

00:39:29.859 --> 00:39:31.359
is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:33.859
Salvation.

00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:37.359
And these believers are being encouraged.

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:40.359
Ye are complete in Him.

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:42.859
Oh, you've made peace with God

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:45.359
and now you have the peace of God

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.359
that passeth all understanding.

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:54.359
This morning, this year, in 2021,

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:57.359
as we are reminded throughout the year,

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:00.859
complete in Him, complete in Christ,

00:40:00.859 --> 00:40:02.859
as we sing the theme song...

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:09.899
complete in thee, that we'd understand that our identity and our acceptance is

00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:17.539
in Christ. Many times in life people seek to describe themselves, to identify

00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:21.419
themselves, and I wonder as the people of God, you know the best way for us to

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:27.059
understand our identity first and foremost is that we are children of God.

00:40:27.059 --> 00:40:34.259
I'm a child of the King, the songwriter said, and what a joy to know the Lord

00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:40.939
Jesus Christ is our personal Savior. And this morning, if you've been saved, I

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:45.739
would say to you that you are complete in Him, but I would challenge you this

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:51.619
morning to allow that truth to impact how you live daily, to understand that

00:40:51.619 --> 00:40:57.979
your acceptance, that your identity is not found in people, positions,

00:40:57.979 --> 00:41:05.699
possessions, wealth, status. No, no, I'm complete in Him, and I can have a peace

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:14.259
and a rest because I understand my acceptance in Christ. That we would not

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:22.619
be influenced by philosophy, vain deceit, tradition, the rudiments of the world, as

00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:27.499
the Bible says there in verse number eight, that we would be rooted and built

00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:33.659
up in Him, understanding that we're complete in Him. This morning, if you've

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:38.219
never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I would say to you

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:43.419
this morning that today is the day of salvation. That's what Paul said. We

00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:49.859
understand that our life is but a vapor. We understand the wise man said in

00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:57.179
Proverbs that we know not what a day would bring forth. Paul said today is the

00:41:57.179 --> 00:42:01.499
day of salvation. And if you've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your

00:42:01.499 --> 00:42:05.459
personal Savior, in the same thought of this message this morning, I would say to

00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:13.379
you that you're incomplete. You need to be saved. And if you would trust Christ

00:42:13.379 --> 00:42:20.659
as your Savior today, you would be complete in Him, complete in Christ. What

00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:26.219
a joy, what a blessing. I look forward with great excitement and anticipation to

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:30.819
preaching and teaching through the book of Colossians this year. I trust that God

00:42:30.819 --> 00:42:37.739
would use the study through this great book to encourage, strengthen, and

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:43.979
challenge each and every one of us. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you

00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:49.859
for loving us. We thank you so much for the Word of God and for the truth

00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:56.779
contained therein. We thank you that you have given us all things that pertain

00:42:56.779 --> 00:43:04.219
unto life and godliness. We thank you that as believers, as the children of God,

00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:11.379
that we can understand that we are complete in thee. God, I pray that this

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:20.659
Bible truth would have a profound impact on every believer within our congregation.

00:43:21.339 --> 00:43:27.339
Father, I pray that if there'd be one under the sound of my voice that's never

00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:34.499
trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, I pray that today would

00:43:34.499 --> 00:43:38.379
be the day of their salvation. I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would

00:43:38.379 --> 00:43:44.419
convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come. I

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:52.859
pray, God, that they would get it settled and then understand that because of

00:43:52.859 --> 00:44:00.339
their salvation, they too would be complete in Christ. Would you have your

00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:06.299
will and way over these next few moments of invitation? Work as only you can, and

00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:11.259
we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
