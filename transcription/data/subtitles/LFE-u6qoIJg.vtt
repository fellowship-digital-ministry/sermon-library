00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
Getting back here this evening to our Ask the Pastor series in Matthew chapter 7, we'll

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.119
be looking at verses 1 through 5, and then we'll be looking over in the book of 1 Corinthians

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.239
as well this evening.

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.039
But here in Matthew chapter 7, we'll be looking at these first five verses.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.180
If you have a bulletin today, you see that the title for the message comes from verse

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.079
number 1, really the entirety of verse number 1, Judge not that ye be not judged.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:30.319
The question submitted is in reference, the way that the question was worded is this,

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:37.520
it's in reference to misquoted or misunderstood Bible verses, and they provide a few examples

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.639
on that particular question.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.400
And this is one of the questions, the first, or one of the verses, the first of the examples

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.220
that was listed on the particular question that was submitted was Matthew 7, 1, and we'll

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.720
examine this portion of Scripture this evening.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.099
Before we dive into the passage of Scripture, there's some things that I think are important

00:00:56.099 --> 00:01:01.419
for us to remember and to be aware of when we think about our approach to the Word of

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:07.500
God as we read the Bible, as we study the Bible, we must take great care to properly

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
interpret and apply the Bible.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.860
And we understand that no prophecy is of any private interpretation.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.099
We read that in the New Testament.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.900
We understand that we're to compare Scripture with Scripture.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.099
Someone said this, that the best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.839
Many times people will talk about and use commentaries, and I'm not suggesting that

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:35.800
it's an evil thing to use commentaries, but really commentaries are what man's thoughts

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.220
are on the Word of God.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.800
And there's some commentaries that are beneficial, that are helpful, that you can have as a resource,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.639
but I would always encourage, and I try to follow this pattern in my own life, is to

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.419
study the Scriptures, and study the Scriptures, and study the Scriptures, and if you might

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.660
go to a commentary at some point, it's not the first thing you do, let me read what this

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.720
person said and then let me go back to the Bible.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.419
It's to search the Scriptures, to interpret, comparing Scripture with Scripture.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:08.520
And so let me just give you a few thoughts with regard to the importance of taking and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.240
properly interpreting and applying the Bible.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.399
Number one is this, context is critical.

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.399
Context is critical.

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:25.320
So often where error creeps in is when text of Scripture is taken out of its context.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.339
And we take and we talk about preaching, we talk about topical preaching, exegetical preaching,

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.960
and expository preaching, and taking and using a context.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.039
Typically I preach exegetical, expository type of messages, that's my style of preaching.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:50.679
But to isogaze is to take a verse and to take it out of context, and it's a problem.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:55.839
I mentioned already, but the second thought is to interpret Scripture with Scripture.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:01.559
And then the third thought is this, that we must resist the temptation to over-spiritualize

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.639
what the Bible says.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.839
There are people that try to over-spiritualize to read things into the Bible that aren't

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.440
really there in the Bible, and so those are some important things.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.000
Someone said this, in fact I was chatting with Brianna about this just a few weeks ago,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.360
I think after one of the teen classes, Brother Jeff had mentioned something to this effect.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.380
But someone said this, if the plain sense makes common sense, then seek no other sense

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.880
lest it become nonsense.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.580
And there's a lot of, it's kind of a word salad if you will, but it's an idea of understanding

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.320
the importance of keeping things within the context.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:41.600
So as we look at this particular question, it is important that we take Matthew 7-1 within

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.160
the context in what it's given.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.919
Notice what the Bible says here in Matthew 7.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.000
Judge not that ye be not judged.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.320
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.440
And with what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you again.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.800
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.119
beam that is in thine own eye?

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:14.839
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye, and behold

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.079
a beam is in thine own eye?

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:26.859
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:31.640
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.320
As we begin to look at this passage of Scripture and look at this subject matter this evening,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.239
a couple of thoughts for you from the passage and then we'll go over to 1 Corinthians and

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:41.559
look at a few things.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:47.040
But number one, if you're taking notes, I believe that we see here a common susceptibility

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.600
is exposed.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.760
A common susceptibility exposed.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.799
It is common for individuals to examine and criticize the behavior of others.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:06.559
It is common for people to examine and try to correct the behavior of others while they're

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:12.079
examining, criticizing, and seeking to correct the behavior of someone else, all the while

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.359
they're ignoring their own behavior.

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:16.579
And that's common.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:21.440
And it's something that is exposed in our passage of Scripture and we find that as we

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.279
often hear people running around and quoting verse number one of Matthew 7, in fact oftentimes

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.760
not even quoting the entirety of it, but just running around saying, judge not, judge

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.320
not, judge not, and that's what they went around and say.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.600
But the reality is that as we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that the Lord

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.160
is exposing this human nature that is common for so many of us.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.399
I've mentioned as we've studied through the book of 1 John on Sunday mornings this year,

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:56.040
how as you go through and you look at the tests that are provided in the book of 1 John,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.600
you've referred to some of them as being a litmus test, and you find that those tests

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.600
are really to be self-prescribed tests.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.799
It's not necessarily that God is giving us this information so that we can apply it to

00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:13.160
others, though we can, but the main emphasis is that we would apply it in our own lives

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.959
and we'd examine ourselves when we observe the Lord's Supper.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.839
The Bible says, but let a man examine himself.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.899
Not necessarily beginning with let a man examine the others sitting in the pew or the people

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.940
that they're passing the cup or the bread to, no, let a man examine himself.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:38.380
And so we find here that it is a common human nature trait for us to seek to examine, criticize,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.859
and correct the behavior of others while at the same time ignoring our own behavior.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:50.299
And this common nature is going to be exposed in this passage of Scripture, and I believe

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:57.059
that the Lord beautifully illustrates this truth in verses three, four, and five.

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:58.059
Notice what he says.

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.619
We find that in verse number one he says, judge not that ye be not judged, and then

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:06.299
he says this, and we'll get to verse number two in just a few minutes with regard to,

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:11.200
with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged, but notice the way in which the Lord Jesus

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:18.220
Christ beautifully illustrates this common susceptibility that is now going to be exposed,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.940
this human nature, this behavior that is so common being exposed.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.420
He gives this beautiful illustration beginning in verse number three, and he says this, and

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.820
why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.820
Right?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.019
That's what we do.

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:42.339
That's the human nature is to notice something in somebody else's life, to look at someone,

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.339
why?

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.820
Because I don't want to examine myself.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:53.260
It's much more challenging, it's just a difficulty when I'm examining myself versus examining

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.059
someone else, but the reality is that here he's saying, listen, you're going through

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:04.579
this process here, and he says, why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye?

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:10.019
But then he says this, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye.

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:13.140
The words that are used are very important to understand.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.700
The word mote and the word beam are used in verse number three.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.100
We find again that he refers to it in verse number four, and then we find again that he

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.579
refers to it in verse number five.

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:28.019
So it's obviously important that we understand the difference between mote and beam and this

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:32.140
exposure that is taking place by the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.739
By the way, when you begin to think about the Pharisees and the Sadducees that Jesus

00:08:35.739 --> 00:08:40.340
so often was addressing and dealing with, though that's not the main audience of this text

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.940
of Scripture, you would find that the Pharisees and Sadducees were individuals that were constantly

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.580
judging others, but don't look at my life.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.419
That's really the way they behaved.

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:55.500
And we find here this evening that when Jesus uses the word mote, he's speaking about, the

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:03.020
word literally refers to a piece of straw or a fleck of debris, really a speck, a piece

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.179
of sawdust, so to speak.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.619
That's what a mote is.

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:14.260
A beam, on the other hand, is a timber that would be used for construction.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.820
Now when you begin to see the illustration that Jesus is painting here and the truth

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.380
in which he's giving, he's saying, listen, judge not that ye be not judged.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.179
He then talks about how that they would be judged with the same, for with what judgment

00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:31.700
ye judge, ye shall be judged, but then he says, why do you hold us now of the mote,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.700
this speck, this piece of sawdust that is in your brother's eye, but you don't consider

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.460
the construction timber that is in your own eye.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.059
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:49.859
And so we find that as the Lord is exposing this human element, this nature of our human

00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:56.059
behavior to try to examine and to correct and criticize the behavior of others while

00:09:56.059 --> 00:10:00.059
ignoring our own behavior, the Lord's saying, listen, you have a beam.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:04.819
in your eye and you're concerned about the moat in your brother's eye. If you're

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:09.019
gonna think about the difference between a moat and a beam, it's significant. It is

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:13.719
a substantial difference between these two words that the Lord would use, and we

00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:17.419
know, as I said this morning and we've said often over the years, that every

00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:25.699
word of God is pure. Jesus picks his words purposefully, amen? And we find that

00:10:25.699 --> 00:10:31.539
as he chooses these words, he's exposing the hypocrisy. He's going to mention that

00:10:31.539 --> 00:10:34.219
in just a moment. Notice what he says in verse number four,

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:39.779
or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the moat out of thine eye,

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:44.579
and behold a beam is in thine own eye. Now think about what he's saying. I mean

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:49.379
physically, if we think about just our eyesight and looking at the example that

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:53.819
he's using, this illustration that is given, there's no way that I can help get

00:10:53.819 --> 00:11:01.339
this fleck, this piece of sawdust, out of your eye if I have a timber in my eye.

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.699
He said that's what you're doing, so you need to understand what he's exposing

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:12.220
here, and then he says this in verse number five, thou hypocrite. The hypocrisy

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.899
is being exposed, and then notice what he says. Notice first and then. It's very

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:22.220
important to understand what's taking place in this passage of Scripture

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.299
because Jesus says, thou hypocrite. What caused them to be a hypocrite? Well,

00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:31.139
they're worrying about somebody else's behavior while they're ignoring their

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:35.899
own behavior. That's what would lead them to this area of hypocrisy, and

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:45.259
Jesus says, first, cast out the beam out of thine own eye. So first matter of

00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:52.199
business is let a man examine himself, right? Let me deal with the beam that is

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:57.799
in mine own eye. Let me deal with that. Let me address that, and honestly, if we

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:02.159
really start understanding the truth of God's Word and begin to walk in the

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:05.919
light as he is in the light, begin to have fellowship with him and seeking to

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:09.919
walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, we'll find

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:14.559
that examining our own selves is almost a full-time job. I'm not gonna have as

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:20.479
much time to try to examine other people, amen? But so long as I'm ignoring the

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:24.919
beam in my eye and I'm running around trying to find all the moats in other

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:30.800
people's eyes, then I'm just going to be a perfect examiner of someone else while

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.160
I'm just not even worried about my own life. And that's not biblical. That's not

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.199
what God tells us. So he says, first, the first order of business, the primary

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:44.279
concern as we begin to understand what's taking place here is that the first

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:48.759
thing that you need to do is cast out the beam out of thine own eye. By the way, I

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:56.440
am so thankful that God in his power will enable us to identify and to deal

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:03.399
with the beams in our lives. Aren't you? That when the Lord uses his Word in your

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:08.360
life and in my life to expose something in our lives that doesn't belong,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.279
something that needs to change, we ought to thank God for that. We ought to thank God

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:17.800
that he loves us enough, that he desires that fellowship with us enough, that he

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.279
exposes it to us, and then that he's gracious to forgive us and to restore

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:28.599
us. And that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly. And so even when he says, first,

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:32.119
cast out the beam out of thine own eye, we can begin to think about the

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:36.880
forgiveness and the restoration that God offers. And I'm thankful that the Bible

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.199
says, with thee, with the Lord, there is forgiveness. Throughout the Old Testament

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:45.880
you find that the prophets of God would refer to the Lord in speaking about his

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:51.279
forgiveness that he's a God who is ready to pardon. He's a God who is ready

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:57.880
to forgive. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.239
sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I'm thankful that our

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:10.160
God is able to restore us to fellowship with him. Amen? What a joy. So he says,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.119
first matter of business is to deal with that beam that's in your eye. And then

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:22.160
notice what he says, and then, and then. So that's subsequent, right? We understand

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.399
the language is being used here, so first I deal with the beam in my eye, but then

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:34.320
he says, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the moat out of thy brother's

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:41.559
eye. So now all of a sudden God will allow us, with that right spirit, after

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:46.839
we've examined ourselves, he will use us to help others. Because there are some

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:52.919
others that do need help. Amen? They need some guidance, they need some leadership.

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:57.600
The Bible, often as we study the Word of God, we see about those that are

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.399
overtaken in a fault. Let me just read to you what the Bible says. You don't need

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:05.059
to turn there, but in Galatians chapter number 6, the Bible says, brethren, if a

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:09.559
man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such in one in the

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:14.799
spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. It's not a

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:19.040
situation where those that are there, referred to in verse number 6, that

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.119
there's just a matter of judgment and casting out, and what have you. No, he

00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:29.480
says that ye which are spiritual, restore such in one, and he says in the spirit

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.399
of meekness. I'm so thankful that two pillars of biblical Christianity are

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:42.600
forgiveness and restoration. My dad was teaching last summer, this past summer, on

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.040
Psalm 23, and what a great study it was through the 23rd Psalm. He took almost

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.600
the entire summer until he had back surgery, and then had to kind of wait for

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:59.559
that last lesson, but he restoreth my soul. That was a great lesson that he

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:04.880
delivered to us from the Word of God on that truth of restoration. And we find

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.000
here that God will use us, and we find this order that's provided. We do not

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.119
find that he says that as he's exposing this human nature, he's giving this

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:22.160
important truth with regard to examining our own behavior. Now, so we see that

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.320
there's a common susceptibility that is exposed, but then I would say this, as we

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.799
look at this passage of Scripture, number two, a consistent standard is essential. A

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:37.639
consistent standard is essential. Pastor, what do you mean by that? Well, notice

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:42.559
what it says in verse number two. In verse number two, the Bible says this,

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:54.679
for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. And with what measure ye meet,

00:16:54.679 --> 00:17:02.079
it shall be measured to you again. See, we mentioned already, as he says in verse

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:07.239
number five, thou hypocrite, the danger of hypocrisy that is here, and we find that

00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:14.079
we are to use the same standard to judge all things. There's not a standard for me

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:20.320
and a different standard for you. So we find that a consistent

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.160
standard is essential. It is absolutely imperative that we have a consistent

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.160
standard when we deal with this subject matter of judgment. And what is that

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.600
consistent standard? The Word of God. It's the Word of God. And we begin to take the

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.760
Word of God, and we can find that we are able to judge all things as we're using

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.079
the consistent standard, and we're understanding the importance of having

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:53.480
the Word of God as that standard for judgment. Does that make sense this

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.600
evening? And so it's not going to be a situation where I'm saying, well, you

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.399
know, you've ever heard the situation, this is for the, but not for me. These

00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:08.239
are rules for you, but they don't apply to me. That's terrible. I said

00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:11.239
this to Breonna last night. Breonna Joseph and I, Holly was there, we were

00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:16.720
talking, and I said this, that rules without relationship breeds rebellion.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.760
And it really does. Rules without relationship will breed rebellion. But

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.639
the reality is that when we go to the Word of God and we understand that we

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:29.839
have a relationship with the God of the universe, that we serve the King of kings

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:33.880
and Lord of lords, and He's given us a word that we're to follow, and we're to

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.279
obey, and we're to take and apply the truth in our lives, there's no rebellion.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:42.359
His commandments are not grievous. Why? Because we understand that He loves

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:47.200
me, and I love Him, and I want to please Him. And we find that it's absolutely

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.320
imperative when we deal with this subject matter of judgment that there's

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.200
this consistent standard that is absolutely essential, and that standard

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:04.599
is the Word of God. The motive is to be pure. We find that in verse number five,

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:08.880
as we've noticed already, where he talks about thou hypocrite, first cast

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.719
out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:18.520
the mote out of thy brother's eye. What do I mean by the motive being pure? So

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.599
often when you think about people that would use this terminology of judge not,

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:26.960
and they begin to deal with that situation, typically the person that is

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.440
doing the judgment is in a position of condemning and not seeking to restore.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.479
And it's not really a pure motive. What is the purpose? What is the the motive

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:42.960
behind the judgment? There needs to be this pure motive if we are going to take

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.039
and examine our own lives, and we're going to use the Scriptures the way that

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:52.119
we're supposed to in my life, and in your life personally, and say, Lord search

00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:57.119
me, and try me, and show me, and reveal to me, and help me to walk in a way that's

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:01.960
pleasing to you, then God will allow us to

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.920
be used in the lives of others to help to expose error, to help them, why?

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.320
Because we want to see them restored.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.160
We want to see them have that fellowship with God.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:21.280
At times, and unfortunately, we're probably guilty of it more than we'd like to admit,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:31.560
judgment can come from a heart of condemning, condemnation, and trying to hurt someone that's

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.080
already dealing with great difficulty.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.680
And we're called by the Lord to help restore.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.000
Someone said this to me years ago, Christians are the only ones that will shoot their wounded.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.200
I thought, man, that's terrible to have that connotation with regard to believers.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.280
Why?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:56.200
Because as believers, listen, I understand that for by the grace of God, amen, and we

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.520
rejoice and we thank God for the truth that he's given us.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.920
And so we find here that in this passage of Scripture, when we deal with this subject

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.760
matter of judge not that ye be not judged, that we find within the context that a common

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.320
susceptibility is exposed, and it's also revealed to us here that a consistent standard is essential.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.520
Now, as we would leave this passage of Scripture, I want you to consider with me the instruction

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.440
that Paul gives to the church in Corinth.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.040
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 5, if you will, and I'll use great discretion

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.000
here in chapter 5, I'd encourage you to, the adults, to be able to, perhaps you already

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.960
know what's going on here in 1 Corinthians 5, but we'll look at some things and I'll

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.800
use great discretion because of the children and what have you, and then we'll jump into

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.360
the 6th chapter and deal with some things here.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.860
But I want you to understand here what's going on, and I want you to understand this instruction

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.860
that Paul gives.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.240
Now, understand the church in Corinth is a carnal church.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.280
The church in Corinth is a church that has many difficulties.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.200
There's divisions and contentions and all sorts of things going on.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.280
We find that Paul begins the 3rd chapter by telling them that I could not speak unto you

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.880
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.880
And they're carnal.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.280
He says that in verse number 3, for ye are yet carnal.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.840
And we find that as we come to the 5th chapter, that wickedness in the church is going to

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840
be exposed.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.720
And notice what the Bible says in verse number 1 of 1 Corinthians 5, it is reported commonly

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.680
that there is fornication among you.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.760
Now, just think about the wording there, it's reported commonly.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.680
This was a known thing that was going on in the church in Corinth.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.160
This was not some secret thing.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.600
This was not something that just a couple, it was a common thing.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.500
It was something that was out in the open.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.920
It was wickedness.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.720
The Bible says that it's such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.360
Now, think about that as he would use as God is exposing this wickedness here.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:01.280
He's saying the situation in Corinth is so bad, the situation is so egregious that it's

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.360
not even something that's named among the Gentiles.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.160
He says this in verse number 2, and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.600
he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.280
And notice what Paul says in verse number 3, for I verily as absent in body, now pause

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.600
with me just for a moment, Paul's not even there.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.240
Paul was used of the Lord to minister to the church in Corinth, to see the church in Corinth

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.440
established.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.320
We find that Paul was used during the missionary journey to have a great work established in

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.200
the city of Corinth, and this church is established, this church is moving forward.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.600
He still has a level of influence in the believers there in Corinth, and God would

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.560
use him to write this and the second letter of Corinthians that go to this church to provide

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:55.000
them with instruction, but he's not even there in body, but notice what he says, but present

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.400
in spirit, and then notice these words, have judged already.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.600
Did Paul never read Matthew 7?

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600
Judge not!

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.160
Paul must not have read Matthew 7.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:16.720
No, Paul did read Matthew 7, he was aware of it, but he says, I've judged already.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.600
Well, how did he make judgment?

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.000
Well, there was a consistent standard that was essential.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.440
Paul's using the Word of God, and Paul's saying this behavior is wicked.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.320
This behavior goes against the Word of God, and it's not hard for me to make judgment

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:42.360
concerning this matter, because it's a violation to this standard.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.280
Does that make sense?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.840
And so, Paul says, it's not inappropriate for me to make judgment, it's not wrong, I've

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.760
already judged.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.760
You guys are there, and you're puffed up, and you're not mourning that he that done

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.920
this deed might be taken away, and we understand that as you go to 2 Corinthians, it seems

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.680
as if as you read the two letters together, that this man, this individual that was in

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.120
this sin, that there was repentance, and Paul encourages them to forgive him and to

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.840
restore him.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.360
That's the biblical motto, by the way.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360
Amen?

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360
There is restoration.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.360
Why?

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.800
Because there is forgiveness.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.740
I'm so thankful that God is long-suffering.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.080
God is gracious.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.600
I'm thankful that Jonah had a second chance.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.320
Amen?

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.480
How many chances have we had?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.960
How many times has God been long-suffering to us?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.480
See, sometimes in our lives, we enjoy and appreciate when God is long-suffering to us,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.720
but not when He's long-suffering to somebody else.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.800
Oh, God, judge them.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.320
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.400
And notice Paul says, I've judged already, as though I were present concerning him that

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.720
hath so done this deed.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.040
Paul says, church, you need to judge this matter.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.000
There was a responsibility that they had with regard to this wicked behavior that was

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.160
commonly known among them.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.280
Paul says, hey, what is wrong with you guys?

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.160
I'm not even there in person, but I'm already given judgment.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:19.480
Because it's obvious that this is a violation to the standard of the Word of God.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:25.280
So we find Paul's own behavior, his own practice, that is mentioned with regard to this subject

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.120
matter of judgment.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.840
Now I want you to move into chapter number six, and I want you to notice what's taking

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840
place.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.120
And really, the problem in the first several verses of 1 Corinthians chapter number six

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.680
that Paul is going to address is believers taking believers to court, and that before

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.040
unbelievers.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.440
The litigation amongst believers before unbelievers is what he's addressing.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.160
And notice what he says, and I'm going to read the first five verses, and then we're

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.160
going to go back and we're going to point out various statements that are made with

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.200
regard to the subject matter of judgment that we're dealing with this evening.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.160
Notice in verse number one, dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.660
before the unjust and not before the saints?

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.780
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:21.240
And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.720
Know ye not that we shall judge angels?

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.680
How much more things that pertain to this life?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.560
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.880
esteemed in the church.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.280
I speak to your shame.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.680
Is it so that there is not a wise man among you?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:45.080
No, not one that shall be able to judge between his brother, between his brethren.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.940
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:55.340
Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.480
Why do you not rather take wrong?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.980
Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.460
Nay, ye do wrong and defraud, and that your brethren."

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.740
Wow.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.100
Inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God to a local church dealing with the subject matter

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.940
of judgment.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.180
And notice what he says, I know I read all eight verses but I want to go back and I want

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:25.060
you to see and really break it down in the context of this subject matter of judgment.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:30.060
Notice what Paul says in verse number one, dare any of you having a matter against another

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.620
go to law before the unjust and not before the saints.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.619
So what's he saying?

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:35.619
There's a problem.

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:38.580
There's some kind of an issue between people in the church.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.760
And so Armando has a problem with Ron and they can't sort this thing out and so they're

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.240
going to take one another to court and they're going to go before the unbelievers.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.720
Paul says, are you kidding me?

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.880
I mean it's not there in the English, it's somewhere in the Greek, amen, I'm just teasing.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.880
But it's not there.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.280
But notice what he says, I mean if you read this text of scripture it's almost like Paul

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.059
is saying, are you guys kidding me?

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:06.940
This is really what you're doing?

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.960
And so no, he says listen, you're going before the unjust and not before the saints?

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.440
Oh wait, this is a different approach.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.840
This is a different understanding.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:22.040
So we're supposed to bring this matter before the saints so that the saints can do what?

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.140
Judge.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.200
What happened to Matthew 7.1?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200
Is there a contradiction?

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.160
No, there's no contradiction at all.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.200
He says judge not that ye be not judged and he says this, you're judging this common susceptibility.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.400
You're judging, it's exposed, you're judging others but you're not judging yourself.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.800
You're worried about some little speck in somebody's eye and you're not concerned about

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.360
the beam that's in your own eye and you're a hypocrite.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.400
You're not using a consistent standard, it's exposed.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.360
But then as you study the whole of scripture, God is saying listen, the believers are to

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.640
judge.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.040
But how do you judge?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.760
What do they judge?

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.100
They judge with a proper standard, it's essential.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:17.640
And they judge righteous judgment, and the purpose, the goal, is restoration.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
That's the goal.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.560
So we find in verse number two, he says this, notice what he says,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:30.840
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.440
You're unaware of this, the saints are going to judge the world.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.600
He's really referring to Revelation, and we can read that in Revelation 20.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:44.600
But he says this, and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.160
smallest matters?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.560
So do you not know, you're not yet been informed, you're not aware of the fact, or at least

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.960
you're not considering it within the context of what's going on, that you're going to judge

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.160
the world.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.240
And if you're going to judge the world, do you mean to tell me that you're unworthy to

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.000
judge the smallest matters?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.280
This is blowing Paul's mind.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.640
He says in verse number three, Know ye not that we shall judge angels?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.240
Wow.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.560
Not only the world, but then the angels.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:25.360
And it says this in verse number three, How much more things that pertain to this life?

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.760
These matters that Paul is talking about, he's saying, listen, if we're going to judge

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.200
the world and we're going to judge angels, how much more things that pertain to this

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
life?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.120
Now again, keeping it all within context and interpreting Scripture with Scripture, it's

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.440
not running around that we're the Baptist police judging everybody and hitting everybody

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.080
upside the head with a club and saying, you didn't do this and you didn't do that.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.080
And you have this.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.080
No, no, no.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.840
I'm first using the Bible in my own life.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.000
And by the way, if we'd all do that, it'd be a whole lot better.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.320
Amen.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.200
Honestly, maybe a whole lot better.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:09.640
But for those that don't, God says, listen, within the household of God, within the believers,

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.280
we're to judge these matters.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.280
Notice what he says in verse number four, If then ye have judgments of things pertaining

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:26.160
to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.360
And then he says this in verse number five, I speak to your shame.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360
Wow.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.480
You know, those are powerful words.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:45.520
Paul says, as we would read in 1 Corinthians 11, as you would enter into the passage of

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.360
Scripture that we typically use for the Lord's Supper, on two occasions in verse 17 and verse

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.640
number 22, he says, I praise you not, because of their behavior.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.680
They were doing things in an inappropriate way.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.440
He says, I praise you not.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.280
Here he says this, I speak to your shame.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.560
Now, if someone says that to you, it doesn't cause you to feel real good about yourself.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.360
I speak to your shame.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.520
Notice what he's referring to.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:19.400
Notice in verse number five, Is it so that there is not a wise man among you?

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:26.160
No, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.880
Do you see what I mean when I say that it's as if Paul's mind is being blown?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:38.520
He's like, seriously, there's no one that can judge between these matters?

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:44.320
That believers are taking the matter before unbelievers?

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.640
Paul says, I speak this to your shame.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.920
Again, he's not offering them some level of commendation.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.760
He's saying, I'm speaking to your shame.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.840
This is unfortunate that in a local church there in Corinth, that there was not a wise

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.800
man among them that could judge between the brethren.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:09.680
But instead, what was happening was brother was going to law with brother and that before

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.680
the unbelievers.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:17.600
Can you imagine how messy that is and how terrible that is for the name of Christ and

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.200
for the cause of Christ?

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:27.200
Believers that are to be understanding of the importance of forgiveness and restoration

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.880
and so on and so forth, they're standing before lost people who were supposed to reach

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.120
with the gospel, by the way, and they're attacking each other on whatever the matter is and why

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.600
they're right and they're wrong and vice versa.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.080
Can you see the picture in your mind's eye?

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080
You understand what's taking place?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.200
Haven't you been in a court?

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.760
I know some of you are in court often.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:56.040
Not because you're, that's not a bad man.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.120
Because you're lawyers, because you're police officers, okay?

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120
Listen to the whole statement.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.440
Somebody's going to take that little excerpt from the online YouTube and they're going

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.880
to just, man, it's going to be a mess.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.760
I'm just teasing.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.240
But we're familiar, right?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.280
Courtrooms typically are not pleasant places.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.040
It's ugly, right?

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.840
Attacking.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.760
Notice what Paul says.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:31.480
Now therefore, verse 7, there is utterly a fault among you.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.000
He said, I speak to your shame.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.480
Now he says there is utterly a fault among you.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480
Why?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.000
Because you go to law one with another.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.400
And then he says this.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.640
He gives them a different perspective.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.400
Why do you not rather take wrong?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.720
Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.160
Nay you do wrong and defraud and that your brethren, and obviously it's a perspective

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.160
there in verses 7 and 8 that's really outside of the discussion this evening with regard

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:04.520
to judgment, but taking the wrong and being defrauded for the sake of really the gospel

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.440
and unity and what have you.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.480
But I want you to really focus on the first six verses of 1 Corinthians chapter number

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480
6.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.920
And as we take what Paul says in the fifth chapter about the matter, the problem that's

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.300
being exposed and explained in Corinth, and then Paul says, I've already judged.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.860
I'm not even there in person, physically, but I've heard about what's going on and I've

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.180
already given judgment.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180
Why?

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.080
Because we have the standard of the Word of God.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:38.500
He then deals with the problem in Corinth where they're going to court one against another,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.660
brethren, amongst unbelievers, and he says, there's not a wise man among you that can

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.660
judge between us.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.380
You're going to judge the world?

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:51.540
You're going to judge angels and you can't judge these small matters?

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:57.220
And so begin to think about the subject matter of judgment.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:03.820
I would say this in conclusion, we need to be careful about how we judge.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.020
Because he says, judge not that ye be not judged, and then he continues and says, with

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:14.220
what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.780
Amen?

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:23.660
We must understand first, in Matthew 7 and verse number 5, that we must examine ourselves.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.500
That we must ask God to help us.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:32.740
That we avoid that which is exposed in those verses of Scripture and perfectly, beautifully

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:39.560
illustrated by the Lord Jesus Christ, that we would avoid that common nature of humans

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.340
to judge others while ignoring our own behavior.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.540
To examine and to criticize and to seek to correct someone else while all at the same

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.700
time we act as if we live above it.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.860
No, no.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.480
That's not appropriate.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.580
That's not how we should behave.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:09.940
And if we take the time to daily examine ourselves and ask God to search us, to reveal in us

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:17.420
the mote, the beam that's spoken of, that would take so much of our time that we won't

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.060
have the time to run around and judge everybody else.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:30.500
But he says, then, in verse number 5 of Matthew 7, after we've done that, God may use us to

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:36.780
help provide guidance and restoration in the life of someone else.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.100
Listen, we don't live in a perfect world.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.340
One day we will.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.580
Isn't that awesome?

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.820
One day we're going to be with the Lord for all of eternity.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.660
But right now we don't live in a perfect world.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.460
And in this world that's not perfect, there's problems.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:01.660
And there's divisions and schisms and there's things that happen.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:08.560
And he says, the spiritual one is to be able to judge.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.140
Did Moses judge?

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.580
He did.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.860
Jethro said, this is no good.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.800
Why?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.140
It's consuming you.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.940
So what do they do?

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.540
They got other men that would be able to judge the smaller matters.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540
Right?

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.540
That's what happened in the Old Testament, right?

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.820
We don't have time to go, it's 656, we don't have time to go back there and look at all

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.820
of it.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.900
But you understand, that's what happened in the Old Testament.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.180
And they got these people involved, these spiritual people involved that could take

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:50.540
the Word of God, the truth that God had given at that particular time, and say, here, this

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.380
is the standard by which we judge.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.380
Right?

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.940
That's what happened.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.100
And so we find that as we come to the New Testament, and Jesus says, judge not, there

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.100
in Matthew chapter number 6.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.580
7, it's not the way that people use it today running around saying, you guys can't judge

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.580
me.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.260
The Bible says judge not.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:16.780
Read the whole context and understand the entirety of God's Word.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.860
Now if you're running around judging people and you're not letting God judge you, and

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:27.100
you're not using this book as a standard in your life, thou hypocrite.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.620
That's what the Bible says.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:36.300
And so we first use God's Word to examine ourselves.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.260
God, I want to please you with my life.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.260
How do I do that?

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.820
What do I do?

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.600
Oh, when the Word of God is read in your daily devotions, when the Word of God is preached,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.460
when we hear it in whatever context we hear it, we sit around a table and have fellowship

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.180
and maybe there's some spiritual conversation that's taking place and the Word of God is

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.300
used and God pricks our heart with regard to something that needs to be dealt with in

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.660
our lives, we deal with it.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.580
And we know that with Him there's forgiveness and there's restoration.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.220
We can rejoice in that.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:12.580
But just as there's forgiveness and restoration for me, there's forgiveness and restoration

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.580
for everyone else.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.580
Isn't that awesome?

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.940
And we've got to be so thankful for that.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:25.540
So I hope as we look at the context of Matthew 7, 1 through 5, coupled with 1 Corinthians

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:31.660
5 and 6, it helps us to have a better understanding of this portion of Scripture and so often

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.920
what we hear people saying to us today of judge not.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:44.260
I'm thankful that God's given us a standard, a standard that is perfect.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.020
See you're not perfect and neither am I.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:53.660
How many times even in a court of law the judge rules in a certain way and you say,

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.660
how did they rule that way?

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:05.900
This book is perfect and when we use this book we can have righteous judgment.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.900
Let's pray.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.900
Father we love You.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.900
We thank You for loving us.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.180
We thank You for the truth of Your Word, for the power of Your Word.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:21.980
God I pray that we'd leave here this evening not with a misunderstanding that we're to

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.260
go out and judge everybody.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:35.080
Lord help us to have a proper understanding that there's this balance and that first Lord

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:41.280
we would come humbly before Thy throne and ask You to examine us and that we'd examine

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:49.020
ourselves by the right standard, the Word of God.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:55.420
And that we'd be honest and we'd be humble before You and before Your Word.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:02.380
God You'd help us to deal with any sin in our lives that needs to be dealt with.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:14.200
Lord that You'd help us to please You that we would not be hypocrites.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:20.680
Lord I pray that You would use us to help others in their spiritual journey.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.120
Not in a condemning or condescending type of a way but in a way of trying to help and

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:35.240
to provide sweet fellowship, forgiveness and restoration.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.680
Lord I pray that You'd help us to take truth from Your Word tonight that would help us

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.280
in our daily behavior.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.080
We pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd have Your will in way.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.120
We pray that decisions would be made that would please Thee and we'll thank You for

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.800
it in Christ's name we pray.
