WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
by ways amen and uh... we certainly understand that he is trustworthy first

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.639
of the chapter number one

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.840
first of the chapter one be looking at verses twelve through seventeen this

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.600
morning

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.140
i trust that you've been working on the memory verse for the month of january we

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.200
went over and sunday school this morning a number of folks are sunny school

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.920
uh... had already had it memorized and so we thank the lord for that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.600
so wonderful verse of scripture will deal with it at the end of the message

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.100
this morning

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.840
as it's in our text and of course in a couple of weeks

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.780
we'll be moving on to the february memory verse those are in the church

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.799
calendar

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.880
uh... if you did not get one there's some on the back table there in fact

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.520
there's some limited number of resources that are remaining in the back there

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.720
and uh... you can feel free to grab those if you need some extras

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.500
uh... after this week will be putting those away and if you need them you'll

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.720
have to let us know

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.240
uh... but those are there for you i'm so glad this morning that as we enter into

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.799
this portion of scripture

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.599
and we're reminded

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:55.200
uh... that god has given us a bible

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
and uh... what a blessing of course i dealt with that pretty much uh... the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.040
entirety of the sunday school this morning

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.599
but it's through this book that we know god and understand what god's plan is

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.400
we understand this this morning that god is the giver

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.440
and the sustainer of life

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.519
and uh... today uh... on calendars around this nation is sanctity of life sunday

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:20.160
and i'm sure that you've probably heard that as a march of life yesterday

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.519
and uh... you begin to think about the sanctity of life and understanding

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:28.480
uh... even on the bulletins this week jeremiah one five is the verse that's

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.199
there

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:32.839
and uh... reminder about god being the giver

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:35.120
uh... and sustainer of life

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.760
and god has placed a high value on life

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.440
and uh... there's no doubt that we would reach that conclusion as bible

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.519
believers

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:47.839
but i would say this morning that you really only reach that conclusion

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:52.879
that life is valuable if you embrace the teaching of god's word

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:58.120
if you take away the teaching and truth of god's word you are not going to reach

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.839
the conclusion

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:03.919
that life has value that life is valuable

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.399
the idea of the sanctity of life as we said already this morning that that is

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.279
uh... recognized today

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.660
but really if you remove god

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.360
atheism tries to remove god by the way you can't remove god god is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.279
and uh... he will always be

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.160
and we thank the lord for that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.720
but there's some that try to deny god by the way romans one talks about those

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.839
that try to deny the existence of god

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.520
and by the way god never tries to prove his existence the bible just starts with

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.320
in the beginning god

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.080
and uh... we see that throughout the scriptures he shows us who he is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.240
and what his plan is but atheism likes to have the idea that they can remove

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.119
god

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:49.600
and let me say this if you remove god life has no value

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.020
if you remove god life has no value

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.039
let me say this

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.240
if you remove creation

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.440
darwinianism

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.839
evolution so popular in our society today

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:04.720
uh... it's gained a lot of traction uh... within our public school systems

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.039
and a lot there's been generations of young people

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.199
that have been indoctrinated with

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.479
with this idea of the

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:18.160
theory of evolution and this evolution mindset this darwinian mindset

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.880
but if you remove the truth of god and creation

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.679
life has no value

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.800
if you follow the teaching of darwin and you understand the teaching of

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.919
evolution

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:35.240
you are never going to reach the conclusion that life has value

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.080
i would say this morning and we'll look at it in this text of scripture if you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.600
remove the truth of salvation if you remove calvary

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.919
life has no value

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.800
we find this morning that the work of redemption

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.720
uh... that is painted for us this reminder that is given to us here in

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.399
first timothy chapter one

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.880
that here the work of redemption the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.520
the work at calvary

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.960
it reminds us of the great value that god has placed on the life of every

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.520
human being

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.320
not only has man been created in the very image of god

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.080
but god in the person of jesus christ went to a cruel cross

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.079
he bled and he died he was buried and he rose again why because life is valuable

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:24.339
life has value

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:29.559
we find that paul clearly declares here in this portion of scripture the reason

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:33.480
for which christ came we find as we've used for the title this morning

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.480
as you look in this text of scripture in verse number fifteen

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.000
i've used it as the title that christ jesus came into the world

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.440
to save sinners

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.160
what a simple statement but how deep the truth

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.119
of that simple statement is

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:51.959
that christ jesus came into the world

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.959
to save sinners it's interesting as you study the book of john and you read

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.160
through the book of john

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.920
that often in the book of john you'll hear this reference or you'll see this

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920
reference

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.440
to the hour

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.559
and uh... he begins referencing that in john chapter number two that the hour is

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.119
not yet come in

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:12.040
he makes that reference a few times over the next several chapters and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.739
eventually get to chapter seventeen he says the hour is come

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.519
and that's the purpose for which christ came into the earth that

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.279
the truth of uh... bethlehem is that he came

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.799
so they could go to calvary

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:27.200
to go to calvary

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.320
and i'm thankful for a place called calvary i'm thankful for

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.799
the work that was accomplished there at calvary

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:36.600
and we find that christ jesus came to the world to save sinners it reveals the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.440
condition of mankind

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.820
that man is lost

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.600
he came into the world to save sinners

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.559
so it reveals to us that simple statement reveals to us that mankind

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:52.279
is lost for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.200
we find that it reveals to us

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.559
this simple statement from verse number fifteen in first samothy chapter one

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.519
reveals to us the love of god

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.359
that he came to save

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:03.959
sinners

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.720
he knew our helpless

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.440
hopeless condition

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.959
he knew that because of sin that entered into the garden

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:16.200
that every human being born thereafter would be born with a sin nature

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.760
and they would be at enmity with god

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.739
in need of reconciliation

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:25.600
and god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.399
believeth in him should not perish

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.160
but have everlasting life

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.519
and we see here that paul says it this way that christ jesus came into the

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.679
world

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:36.920
to save sinners

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.079
as we look at this truth this morning and we see

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:45.000
the way in which this was accomplished the substitutionary atonement

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.600
the sacrificial death

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.880
we see it as we read the gospel accounts we read

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.200
throughout the book of acts how the apostles

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.200
uh... reference back to that

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.200
event that took place at calvary that substitutionary atonement that

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.679
sacrificial death

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:03.679
where jesus took your place in my place on that cruel cross

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:05.760
we understand that he was buried

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.079
but all just a few days later there's a glorious

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:13.760
event that takes place the bodily resurrection of the lord jesus christ

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.040
we sing the song up from the grave he arose and how wonderful

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.839
it is to know that he lives

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.359
and this morning when we think about the value of human life

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:28.359
and we see what paul is referencing here in this portion of scripture

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:32.880
it helps us to understand that god has set a premium

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.959
on life

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:38.279
he died for us first peter chapter one says this you don't need to turn there

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.920
but we're not redeemed with corruptible things

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.920
we're not redeemed with gold and silver

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.600
no no we're redeemed with the precious

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.760
blood

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.359
of christ

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.559
what a wonderful truth

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:55.920
that would be given to us in first peter one verses eighteen and twenty i i just

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.600
paraphrase those verses

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.279
and and kind of help us to understand

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.320
in here paul

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.480
he understands the glorious truth

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.119
and in this portion of scripture just a few verses

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.600
he's going to share his testimony look with me in verse number twelve

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.480
paul says this and i thank christ jesus our lord

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.519
who hath enabled me

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.119
for that he counted me faithful

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.920
putting me into the ministry

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.720
who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.480
and injurious

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.040
but i obtained mercy

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.960
because i did it ignorantly in unbelief notice verse fourteen in the grace of

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.479
our lord was exceeding

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.760
abundant

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.039
with faith and love which is in christ jesus

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.919
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:46.000
into the world

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.320
to save sinners of whom

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.320
i am chief

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.479
how be it

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:53.640
for this cause i obtained mercy

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.159
that in me first jesus christ might show forth all long-suffering

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:03.200
for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.380
to life everlasting

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.320
that our memory verse for this month now under the king eternal

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.320
immortal invisible

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.919
the only wise god be honor and glory forever and ever

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:17.840
amen

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.919
what a great portion of scripture

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:23.000
as we look at these few verses of scripture this morning and see

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.479
where paul was testifying of what christ did for him

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:29.919
i want to notice if you're taking notes this morning number one consider what

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.419
paul received

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:35.280
notice through this passage of scripture that paul references what it

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.799
was that he received

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:41.359
we'll look at verse thirteen where he says this but i obtained

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:42.440
mercy

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.760
i'm so thankful that our god is merciful

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.280
i'm so thankful that he

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.260
uh... is a god who is

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.599
rich in mercy according to ephesians chapter number two

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:53.119
i'm thankful this morning

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:57.320
that i personally even as paul would testify in verse thirteen that i

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.719
obtained mercy

00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:00.000
that i personally in

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.619
you personally can stand with Paul and say, I have obtained mercy.

00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:11.840
To be the personal recipient of God's mercy, how blessed we are.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.639
We find that not only does Paul recognize that he received mercy, but we find that he

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:19.280
speaks of the grace that he received.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.399
In verse number 14 he says, and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.120
I love the way that he uses that phraseology.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.680
We sing, and of course many of us are familiar with that wonderful song, Amazing Grace, and

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.520
what a great song it is, and you understand the backstory to that song, and the way that

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.000
the writer understood the grace of God, and here Paul, he doesn't use the word amazing

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.080
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says that it was exceeding abundant.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.279
I didn't just need a little bit of grace, I need a lot of grace, and I'm thankful that

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.279
our God is gracious.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.560
I'm thankful that our God is merciful.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.720
I'm thankful that as I look here, that I could say this as I think about the mercy and the

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.919
grace that Paul received, that he received salvation.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:11.080
He says that he received the mercy in verse 13, the grace in verse number 14, but in verse

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.400
number 15 he gives the idea, the truth of being saved.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:23.319
He says this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:33.360
into the world to save sinners, and then he says this, of whom I am chief.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.279
Paul said, God saved me.

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:41.160
Can you imagine this morning, Paul as he's sharing with Timothy the importance of continuing

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.959
as he's giving Timothy the charge to continue and all the false teaching that's going on

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:53.959
and all the importance of continuing in sound doctrine and teaching the truth, and we mentioned

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:59.559
these things over the last couple of weeks, and now Paul says that I have obtained mercy,

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:04.919
that God's grace is exceeding abundant, that I've been saved by the grace and mercy of

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:10.720
God, and he came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.399
It's a wonderful message.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.360
It's actually the message that he references in verse number 11, where he talks about,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.559
he calls it this, the glorious gospel.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.399
I'm so thankful for the glorious gospel.

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:28.679
The gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ, and we find that the glorious gospel, he says

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:34.399
this, of the blessed God which was committed to my trust, and it reveals to us when you

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:40.440
think about what Paul received, not only did he receive mercy and grace and salvation,

00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:44.039
but he received a purpose in living.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:48.880
You know, many people today, when you talk to them, and even if you would think about

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.800
and review your own life, there's a lack of purpose apart from Christ.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
Why are we here?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800
What is the purpose?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.320
What are we to achieve?

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.320
And I remember as a young person, and I remember going through high school and not being saved

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.600
and kind of struggling with that idea of why am I here, what is my purpose?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.960
And then I got saved by the grace of God, his mercy and his grace, and he saved me.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.119
And then he gave me purpose, gave me a calling.

00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:25.679
And this morning, I've said to so many people over the years that really I had no purpose,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.679
no direction.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:30.360
Oh, could you talk to me about what do you want to do when you grow up, and what kind

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.440
of career do you want to have, and what's of interest?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.440
And sure, you could talk about those kind of things, but was there really purpose?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:45.000
And we find this morning that Paul understood that what he received, not only salvation,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.880
but he received purpose for living.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.559
He says in verse number 11 that according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:55.360
which was, notice, committed to my trust.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.440
There's this personal purpose and responsibility, and then he elaborates on that in verse number

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440
12.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.559
Notice he says, and I thank Christ Jesus.

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:10.800
Notice when he says, our Lord, he's my Lord and my Savior.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.320
He says this, who hath enabled me?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.980
I'm thankful for God's enabling.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.320
We could talk about God's grace, not only in saving, which we see in verse number 14,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.160
but we also see in his enabling grace for service, he's enabled me.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:34.959
And then notice when he says, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:36.440
Putting me into the ministry.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.739
It helps us understand the way that God calls people in the ministry.

00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:42.559
It wasn't necessarily that Paul just said, you know, I think this would be a good career

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:43.940
path for me.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:50.079
There's a lot of benefits over here, and it's, no, God called him, God equipped him, God

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:53.200
put him into the ministry.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.880
What a blessing.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880
And Paul has purpose.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.480
I want you to think about the life of Paul, and you think about what he received, and

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.559
you understand that as Paul would reference in this text of Scripture, these are the things

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:09.640
that I have been a recipient of.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.399
And I want you to think about Timothy.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:17.440
You know, Timothy, a lot of writers have the belief that Timothy, because of the circumstances

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.339
in Ephesus, because of the false teaching that was going on, and we've already outlined

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:28.380
some things over the last few weeks of entering into this portion of study through 1 and 2

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.739
Timothy with the thought of continue.

00:15:30.739 --> 00:15:36.820
Some have the idea that Timothy was at a place of discouragement in his life.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.160
Because of the discouragement in his life, thus the charge, continue.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.140
Because of the thought of maybe giving up and turning back because of all the pressures,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.799
Paul says, no, continue.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:52.540
And I want you to think how God would use this portion of Scripture, as Paul is writing

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.720
to Timothy, to help Timothy to be encouraged.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.880
You know how encouraging it is when you begin to hear somebody talk about their testimony

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.200
of being saved?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.880
And then you all of a sudden say, you know what?

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.359
I received mercy too.

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:06.920
God's grace was abundant, exceeding abundant to me too.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920
Guess what?

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.320
God gave me purpose as well.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.880
He saved me.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.320
All of a sudden we get our attention off of our circumstances and onto our Lord and what

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.959
His purpose is for us and how He saved us and oh how glorious that is.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:25.399
God is infinite wisdom.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:31.959
In this portion of Scripture has Paul transitioned for just a period of time and share this testimony

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:39.200
that I think would be used in such a powerful way to encourage his man, Timothy.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.799
I hope it encourages you this morning as well when we consider what we've received.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.640
When we look here, Paul considered what he had received and he rehearsed what he had

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.640
received.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.679
But I want you as we continue to move through the passage of Scripture, not only consider

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:57.799
what Paul received, but consider number two, what Paul remembered.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:59.839
Notice what Paul remembered.

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:06.799
Verse number 13 is an interesting verse of Scripture because Paul remembered who he was.

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:11.720
Do you remember who you were before you got saved?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.440
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief is what Paul says.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.799
And we looked at that verse just a moment ago and we can think about the truth of Luke

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:26.200
19 where the Bible says that Christ Jesus for this purpose the Son of Man came for what?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.119
To seek and to save that which was lost.

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:32.700
And we notice here that Paul, he remembered who he was.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.880
He says in verse number 13, who was before?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.720
You know, anyone that's saved has a before.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.279
For some of us, our before is longer than others.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:50.320
Isaac trusted Christ just a couple of Wednesdays ago.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320
He's eight years old, right?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.320
He's eight.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320
Isaac is eight.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.160
And so his before is a lot shorter than some of our befores.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.440
But what I'm thankful for is our before, excuse me, let me say it this way, our before doesn't

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.859
define our present or our future.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:09.140
We all have a past.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.779
We all have a before.

00:18:11.779 --> 00:18:15.299
And Paul says this, who was before?

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:20.700
A blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.380
But then he says I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.420
It's interesting because Paul often will talk about who he was before he got saved and who

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.700
he is after he got saved.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.859
And we find that it's said this way in Galatians chapter number one, in verse number 23, the

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:44.140
Bible says, but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in time past now preacheth

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.500
the faith which once he destroyed and they glorified God in me.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.140
Now think about that transition.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.900
He went from persecuting to preaching.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:00.659
He went to go and imprison and beat and even sentenced to death those that were preaching

00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:07.580
the glorious message of the gospel and then he gets saved by the grace of God and he begins

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.500
to preach the same message that he was persecuting others for preaching.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.299
I mean it's amazing and Paul though he remembers who he was.

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:21.979
You know sometimes it's a good exercise for us to remember who we were.

00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:24.900
To remember how hopeless we were.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.900
To remember how helpless we were.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.820
And it helps us to see God's grace and God's mercy.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:38.940
Oh we should never glory in our past, we never glory in our sin, but oh when we remember

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:44.179
who we were, where we were, we remember what Christ did for us.

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:50.299
See Paul says he was a blasphemer to revile or to speak reproachfully of God.

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:55.940
Paul says that he was a persecutor, one who would pursue another unjustly, one who would

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.859
harass, one who would seek to inflict pain.

00:19:58.859 --> 00:19:59.859
That's what he was.

00:19:59.859 --> 00:19:59.859


00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:05.579
He was a blasphemer, he was a persecutor, he was injurious, he was unjust, he was hurtful

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:10.619
to those, to the rights of others, he was violent.

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:17.859
It's interesting if you look at Acts chapter number 7, the Bible will tell us about the

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:20.379
stoning of Stephen.

00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:23.899
You read in Acts chapter number 7, the preaching of Stephen, I mean what a great sermon that

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:28.579
Stephen preached and he preaches, he had a good handle of God's word, he preached a great

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:33.739
message and we find that the Bible tells us at the end of the text of scripture that

00:20:33.739 --> 00:20:40.539
his clothes were left and laid at a man's feet, the man's name was Saul.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:46.899
And Saul I believe because of what he witnessed there at the stoning of Stephen and how he

00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:50.699
experienced that moment and seeing all that took place.

00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:55.779
In chapter number 8 he intensifies his persecution against the church.

00:20:55.819 --> 00:21:01.819
I mean he's, the persecution is intensified, chapter 9 specifically talks about Saul going

00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:07.379
out and he's got the letters, he's got the authority, he's breathing out these threatenings

00:21:07.379 --> 00:21:10.299
and I mean he's just on a rampage, why?

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:15.379
Because sometimes that's how we respond to conviction.

00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:20.539
Sometimes when conviction comes we respond by just trying to bore right through it and

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:27.939
just try to just overcome it with intensifying the rebellion towards that which is giving

00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:28.939
us conviction.

00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:30.939
And that's what Saul did.

00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:34.299
But something miraculous happened in Acts 9.

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:38.779
Saul's on his way to Damascus, you know the account, and as he's on the way to Damascus

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:48.059
the Bible says that he sees a bright light, Saul, Saul, and he hears the voice of God

00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:52.379
and he says, who art thou, Lord?

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:57.499
And he says this, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:00.819
And we find that in Acts chapter number 9 it all changed.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.579
It was a glorious transformation.

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:07.299
I'm thankful this morning that the Bible speaks about transformation.

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:10.579
Salvation that Christ offers is transforming.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.419
Some people talk about needing reformation.

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:15.259
We don't need reformation, we need transformation.

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:20.379
We don't need for an individual to be reformed, no, we need to be transformed by the power

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:21.379
of God.

00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:29.579
2 Corinthians 5.17 says this, therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:33.579
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:39.619
Paul saw, he remembered what Christ did for him.

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:41.739
He remembered who he was.

00:22:41.739 --> 00:22:44.279
He remembered what Christ did for him.

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:49.559
He remembered, no doubt as you study the life of the Apostle Paul and you watch and you

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:54.159
walk with him through the book of Acts and the various journeys that God lets him go

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:59.759
on and the people that he has the privilege of standing before and testifying to, we find

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:04.639
that Paul regularly revisits the road to Damascus.

00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:09.759
I wonder this morning how often do we remember where we were when we got saved?

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:14.039
How often do we remember the day that we got saved?

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.199
Can you remember this morning where you were when you got saved?

00:23:17.199 --> 00:23:18.999
I remember where I was.

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:23.279
I remember being in the living room of that house in Southern California.

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:26.159
I didn't want to move to Southern California, my parents didn't want to move to Southern

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:30.359
California, we wanted nothing to do with Southern California, but God took us to Southern California

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:33.039
and by God's grace I got saved in Southern California.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:39.639
I remember coming home from church and I remember the conviction in my own life and I remember

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:45.299
the hypocrisy acting as if I was saved but knowing that I was not saved and kind of walking

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.999
through and knowing the right answers to give.

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:53.639
But oh, the conviction came upon me and I knew I was not saved.

00:23:53.639 --> 00:24:01.679
I bowed my heart and I got on my knees in that living room, in that military housing

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:07.719
on Camp Pendleton and I got saved by the grace of God, praise God.

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:10.519
Sometimes it's good for us to revisit in our minds, you might not be able to go to the

00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:16.000
exact place where you got saved, I can't go to that home and I can't go to that living

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.479
room, I don't even know if the home's still there.

00:24:20.479 --> 00:24:24.799
But in my mind, I can go back and I can remember.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:26.879
You know, it does us good.

00:24:26.879 --> 00:24:32.199
Here's a thought this morning with this truth of what Paul remembered in thinking about

00:24:32.199 --> 00:24:37.679
the fact that he says, who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.

00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:39.359
But he says, I obtained mercy.

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:42.799
I think about what Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6.

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:47.359
Turn over there if you will and I want you to see what God says and about God's grace

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:52.879
and how thankful we are for the grace of God which has been bestowed upon us.

00:24:52.879 --> 00:24:57.859
And Paul received salvation, he received the mercy and the grace, he was saved by the grace

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:00.939
of God, he received purpose for his life, for living.

00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:05.899
And we find in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, notice if you will in verse number 9.

00:25:05.899 --> 00:25:11.500
1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse number 9, the Bible says this, know ye not that the

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.419
unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:20.779
Be not deceived, neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:26.779
of themselves with mankind, nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:29.339
shall inherit the kingdom of God.

00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:43.339
Say, man, we're guilty and he says this in verse number 11, and such were some of you.

00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:47.899
You see that little word, but, I'm so thankful for that little word.

00:25:47.899 --> 00:25:52.139
Great conjunction, a change in direction.

00:25:52.139 --> 00:25:59.659
Be such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:04.699
in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.

00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:09.539
I love verse number 11 of 1 Corinthians 6 and we have to catch it in context.

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:15.219
You have to read verse 9 and 10 and understand who they were, what they were, and the fact

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:19.579
that you cannot inherit the kingdom of God, but I'm thankful for God's grace and God's

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:24.019
mercy and that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:27.819
Paul says, of whom I am chief.

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:32.299
How many times Jesus goes in and he speaks to the religious leaders of the day who were

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.299
self-righteous.

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:39.299
I mean, they wanted everyone to look at them and Jesus regularly, it was clear through

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:44.419
his teaching and through his interaction with that group of people that he says, you guys

00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:45.419
are self-righteous.

00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:48.179
You're not looking for a savior.

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:53.419
You think that your good works, you think that your position is going to earn you some

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:54.419
inheritance.

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:56.299
No, no, no.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:27:00.739
Understand that he said, I came to seek and to save that which was lost.

00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:03.019
He came for sinners.

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:05.059
By the way, we're all sinners.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:08.500
And I love verse number 11 when he says, and such were some of you.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.659
But then notice the three words that describe us now.

00:27:11.659 --> 00:27:16.859
Paul says that he remembers, this is what I was before.

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:20.459
I was a blasphemer, I was a persecutor, I was injurious.

00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:25.739
But look at these three words that define us after that transformation.

00:27:25.739 --> 00:27:27.379
I'm washed.

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.939
I'm sanctified.

00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:29.939
I'm justified.

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:32.139
Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:32.139 --> 00:27:34.939
The transformation of the gospel.

00:27:34.939 --> 00:27:40.979
This morning, Paul, as we look at this portion of Scripture, we see what he received.

00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:46.199
Mercy, grace, salvation, purpose.

00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:48.519
We see what he remembered.

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:51.119
Perhaps you're familiar with that wonderful song.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.119
I was actually singing it through the building this morning.

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:56.399
It's a good thing no one was here early.

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:00.439
Calvary covers it all.

00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:03.759
Not just some of it, but all of it.

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:05.279
Calvary covers it all.

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:11.559
My past with its sin and stain.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:18.199
My guilt and despair, Jesus took on him there.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:22.399
And Calvary covers it all.

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:25.719
I'm so thankful this morning for salvation.

00:28:25.719 --> 00:28:26.719
Paul received.

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:28.500
Paul remembered.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.239
Consider with me as we conclude this morning, consider how Paul rejoiced.

00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:35.320
Consider how Paul rejoiced.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:41.260
We come to the verse of Scripture that we've set as our theme verse for this particular

00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:47.059
calendar year, excuse me, this month of the calendar, in verse 17 of 1 Timothy 1.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:54.339
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever

00:28:54.339 --> 00:28:56.140
and ever.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.619
Amen.

00:28:57.619 --> 00:29:01.760
Paul, why is it that they're such rejoicing?

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.979
Because Paul remembered what he received.

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:07.979
Paul remembered who he was.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:10.419
And now he's rejoicing greatly.

00:29:10.419 --> 00:29:16.140
Notice what he says in verse 16 as we begin to understand Paul making this truth in this

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.000
application even that would be for us still even today.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.219
He says that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief in verse

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:24.219
15.

00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:32.619
But then in verse 16, how be it for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:40.159
might show forth all longsuffering, then notice this, for a pattern to them which should hereafter

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:43.880
believe on him to life everlasting.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.320
I'm thankful that God's longsuffering.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.000
I'm thankful for this pattern that we see here in verse 16 that is established where

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.799
Paul says that he set forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:06.359
hereafter belief. Belief for what? On Him to life everlasting. This morning as we begin

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:10.519
to think about this portion of Scripture, as we begin to think about Paul sharing his

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:18.519
own testimony, but then we see how Paul is rejoicing. This morning, he says, now unto

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:27.719
the King eternal. Oh, I'm thankful that we serve an eternal God. Immortal. Invisible.

00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:39.319
Firstly says, the only wise God. Be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. This morning

00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:47.039
as Paul is rejoicing in this portion of Scripture, I wonder this morning, how often are we rejoicing

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:55.079
for the same reason that we see Paul rejoicing here in 1 Timothy chapter number 1? Often

00:30:55.079 --> 00:31:05.039
our rejoicing, unfortunately, is based on how our circumstances are going. Somebody

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:13.519
said this, we ought to be more like a thermostat than a thermometer. You know the difference

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:20.399
between a thermostat and a thermometer? One sets the temperature, one reads the temperature.

00:31:20.719 --> 00:31:28.559
Right? And sometimes we deal with our interactions in life like we're the thermometer. We vary

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:33.279
all over the place based on our circumstances, what's going on. But we need to be like that

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:37.139
thermostat that just sets the temperature. He says, listen, this is the day the Lord

00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:42.999
hath made me. I'm going to rejoice and be glad in it. Why? Because I'm going to heaven.

00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:48.839
You say, pastor, you don't know how bad my day was Tuesday, Friday, whatever day. I mean,

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:53.159
everything that could go wrong went wrong. Guess what? You're still going to heaven.

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:58.879
Amen? You say, pastor, you just make it too simple. I'm just telling you this morning

00:31:58.879 --> 00:32:05.039
that Paul had a harder life than you did, or than you do. Paul faced some terrible things.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:13.639
But he's a man that's rejoicing. Why? I think because he regularly remembered his salvation.

00:32:13.639 --> 00:32:19.279
He remembered what Christ did for him. He remembered how he saved his soul. And this

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:26.639
morning I would say it this way, we must never get over being saved. We must never get over

00:32:26.639 --> 00:32:31.519
being saved. You know, sometimes the further we get removed, if you will, from the time

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:37.839
of our salvation, sometimes we can become forgetful. Sometimes we can almost just, man,

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:43.399
it seems like I've always been saved. No, you haven't always been saved. And we think

00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:49.719
about Paul rejoicing in this portion of Scripture, and I wonder this morning, when we read verses

00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:56.919
like rejoice evermore, when we read verses like what I mentioned a moment ago in Psalm

00:32:56.919 --> 00:33:00.639
118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:07.359
it. It's a determination. It's a decision that we make. And when we have every day of

00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:13.239
our lives, I hope this morning, when we face each day of our life, that we begin that day

00:33:13.239 --> 00:33:18.759
not only thanking God for the day, but being mindful of thanking God for our salvation,

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:22.639
what He did for us, how He saved us. Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, chapter

00:33:22.639 --> 00:33:31.159
10. I believe this morning that as we determine that we'll never get over being saved. I hope

00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:37.679
you understand what I mean by that. Sometimes it seems like we can be like the church at

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:43.719
Ephesus that's being rebuked there that left their first love. In the book of Revelation,

00:33:43.719 --> 00:33:50.199
chapter number 2, God says, I have somewhat against you. See, we must never get over the

00:33:50.199 --> 00:33:57.039
fact that we've been saved by the grace of God. And we find this morning that in Luke

00:33:57.039 --> 00:34:01.999
chapter number 10, the Lord Jesus Christ is interacting here. And the Bible says that

00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:06.559
He sent out 70. Notice in verse number 1, after these things, the Lord appointed other

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:10.879
seventy also and sent them two and two before His face into every city and place, whether

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:15.639
He Himself would come. He said unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labors

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:20.440
are few. Pray therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth labors into His harvest.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.879
Go your ways, behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. He gives them instruction

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:33.519
with regard to the purpose of them going out. We see that they go and we will not take the

00:34:33.519 --> 00:34:38.679
time to read all the way through down 16 and all the instruction that's given. But I want

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:43.799
you to see in verse 17, the Bible says that the 70 return, according to verse number 17.

00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:50.799
So in verse number 1, we find that He's sending out these 70. He sent them two and two, according

00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:55.399
to verse number 1 of chapter 10. And then we find in verse 17 that they return. The

00:34:55.399 --> 00:35:02.399
70 returned again. Notice what it says, they returned how? They returned with joy. They

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:10.839
returned with joy. I want you to think about these folks returning with joy and it's important

00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:16.519
that we as God's people, we have joy. But I want you to see what their joy is in. What

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:21.319
was it that caused them to have joy? Well notice in verse 17, notice what they say to

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:28.319
the Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. I mean that was causing

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:32.759
them to rejoice. We went out like you said and I mean, and by the way, Jesus said you

00:35:32.759 --> 00:35:36.759
were going to have power over this and then they saw they're coming back with joy. I mean

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:43.759
look at what happened. They're rejoicing. He said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:50.079
fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:55.879
over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you. That's a great

00:35:55.879 --> 00:36:00.559
promise in verse 19 that he gave to these 70. But I want you to see what he says in

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:07.559
verse 20. Notwithstanding in this rejoice not. In what? That the spirits are subject

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:15.440
unto you. But rather rejoice. Rejoice why? Because your names are written in heaven.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.440
That's a wonderful verse of scripture because you know what? As they would go forth, you

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.239
ever go out trying to reach people at the gospel? Listen, when I've gone out and I try

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:41.959
to reach people at the gospel, it is an exciting thing when someone gets saved. When you're

00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:46.639
able to open the word of God and show them from God's word how they're a sinner in need

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:50.519
of the only savior to expound to them the very truth that we're looking at here from

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:56.079
first Timothy chapter one that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom

00:36:56.079 --> 00:37:01.759
I am chief and we say, listen, you might be a sinner, but he's a savior and he came to

00:37:01.879 --> 00:37:08.639
save sinners. And you sit down with them and you go through the scriptures and you show

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:15.639
them how the word of God teaches that we're all sinners. We're all in need of the savior.

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:20.759
God loved us so much that he died for us. He took our place so that we could be saved

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:27.599
by the grace of God. You talk to that individual and you share the gospel with them and Dion

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:31.359
and Armando were sitting there with me on Wednesday night a week and a half ago when

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:35.519
Isaac, we went through this very process and we're sharing the gospel with Isaac and sharing

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:42.519
the verses and Isaac says, I want to be saved. And Isaac bowed his head and he prayed and

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:48.239
he asked Jesus to save him. Listen, the Bible says there's rejoicing in heaven and there's

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:54.239
rejoicing on earth. We were rejoicing in that moment. It was wonderful. You go out and you

00:37:54.279 --> 00:37:57.979
go soul winning, you go trying to reach people with the gospel and you see somebody respond

00:37:57.979 --> 00:38:04.979
in faith, it's exciting, but it doesn't happen all the time. And if that's the requirement

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:13.839
for us to rejoice, it's going to be all over the place. We're going to be like a thermometer,

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:20.839
are rejoicing. You understand what I'm saying? But Jesus says, don't rejoice in that. Rejoice

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:28.079
rather that your names are written in heaven. You know what's amazing about that? It can't

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:34.799
change. It can't change. We sing the song, you're familiar with it, and I said this to

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:40.320
Isaac just after he prayed. I said, Isaac, you know that song? And unfortunately he didn't

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.519
remember the song so it kind of spoiled my whole situation there. But there's a wonderful

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:50.700
song. There's a new name written down in glory. And what does it say? And it's mine, oh yes

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:56.339
it's mine. What a joy. And I told Isaac, I said, well you need to learn that song,

00:38:56.339 --> 00:39:00.539
you can sing it, because you just got saved. Your name is written down in glory. What a

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:06.279
wonderful truth that Jesus gives us here in Luke chapter number 10, because your names

00:39:06.279 --> 00:39:13.219
are written in heaven. I wonder this morning, do you know that your name is written in heaven?

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:18.820
Do you know that you've been saved by the grace of God? As Paul rehearses here in first

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:23.859
Timothy chapter number 1, as he's seeking to be used of the Lord to encourage his son

00:39:23.859 --> 00:39:28.820
in the faith, to encourage Timothy to continue on, not to give up, not to throw in the towel,

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:34.979
but to continue, he begins to rehearse his testimony. He begins to share with Timothy

00:39:34.979 --> 00:39:40.419
how that he received some things. He didn't work for some things, he received them. They're

00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:47.419
gifts. He received grace. He received mercy. He received redemption. He received salvation

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:54.940
through the Lord Jesus Christ. And at that moment in Paul's life, his name was written.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.820
His name was written in the book. And what a glorious truth.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:06.100
See, Paul gives truth to this in the book of Philippians, in chapter number 4.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.860
He speaks about that very truth of those that have their names written in the book of life.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.560
He speaks of, as he's giving this truth, and I want you to consider as we put all this

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.620
together and try to wrap it together this morning and see in our final point, why is

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.860
Paul rejoicing in the way that he is?

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.460
Why does he conclude the portion of Scripture?

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.060
It almost, someone could almost look at it and say, well, it's kind of out of place.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:34.420
No, it's right in place because he's rehearsing his salvation, he's rehearsing what Christ

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.900
did for him and how God gave him mercy and grace and saved him and gave him purpose and

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:46.180
who he was before he remembered, but he remembered that what he was before does not define who

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.660
he is now because there was something that took place on the road to Damascus.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.380
He was saved by the grace of God.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:01.660
Therefore, he says, now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.660
honor and glory forever and ever.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.660
Amen.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.020
In Philippians chapter number 4, he begins in verse number 1, he says,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.740
Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for my joy and crown, so stand fast

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.180
in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.860
I beseech Jodeas and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.900
And I entreat thee also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:30.380
the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers, notice what he says, whose

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.900
names are written in the book of life.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.100
Do you know what the next verse is?

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:42.320
Verse 4, rejoice in the Lord always.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.540
And again, I say, rejoice.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:51.860
Is it not of interest to you this morning that when Jesus is teaching in Luke chapter

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:59.020
number 9, those 70 are sent out, they return with joy, and Jesus says, listen, yes, you've

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.120
been given power over that, but don't rejoice in that, rather rejoice that your names are

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.340
written in heaven.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.900
We find that Paul says to the believers in Philippi, as he's writing to them, he speaks

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.820
of those whose names are in the book of life, and he says, rejoice in the Lord always.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.460
And again, I say rejoice.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.700
And then when he shares his testimony in 1 Timothy chapter number 1 with Timothy, and

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:26.020
he says, here's what has happened to me, I've been saved by the grace of God.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:32.700
My name was written in the book of life, therefore I rejoice.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.700
But Paul, this is against you, but Paul, this has happened, but Paul, they are going to,

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.500
my name is written in the book of life.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.860
I've been saved by the grace of God.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.860
D.L.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:52.860
Moody famously, it's said of him, and I'm not sure how you would respond to such a situation,

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860
but it is said that D.L.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:43:00.980
Moody was on the streets of Chicago, and a man pulled a gun on him, and held the gun

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:07.340
right to him, and he looked at that man and said, you can't threaten me with heaven.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340
That's amazing.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:14.260
That's a man that knew that his name was written in the book of life, a man that had assurance

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.660
of his salvation.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.860
And this morning, when we think about this passage of Scripture, and that great declaration

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.980
that is given in verse number 15 of the text, now this is a faithful saying and worthy of

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:35.820
all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:43.780
I wonder this morning, when we recognize what we've received, as Paul did, when we remember

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:50.420
who we were and what Christ did for us, how does it impact our rejoicing?

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.820
This morning, maybe you're here and you say, I don't know that there's ever been a time

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.620
in my life where my name was written in the book of life.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.380
I don't know today that heaven is my home.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.820
If someone held a gun to me like they did to D.L.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.180
Moody, I would not say you can't threaten me with heaven, because I don't know what

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180
would happen.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:15.460
Can I tell you this morning, 2 Corinthians says, today is the day of salvation.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.660
Today, your name could be written in the book of life, because Christ Jesus came into the

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:26.420
world to save sinners.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.100
He loved us so much.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:33.540
He knew our condition, but He loved us so much, and He went to a cruel cross.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.540
He bled and He died.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.980
He was buried and He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:44.380
And He says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.500
This morning, maybe there's someone that needs to be saved this morning.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.059
For many of us, we've already been saved.

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:53.660
Our names have been written in the book of life.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:45:01.100
For me, it was written on August 31st, 1997, that little living room of that government

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.540
provided housing on Camp Pendleton.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.980
I don't know where the place was for you.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:16.300
But I wonder how often do we, in our minds, revisit that place so that we would rejoice

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.660
in what Christ has done for us.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:26.420
See, we're going to face some difficulties, but on your worst day and on my worst day,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:33.260
I'm still going to heaven, and nothing, no one can take that away from me.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.740
And if you're saved this morning, nothing and no one can take that away from you.

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.540
And that is a great Bible teaching.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:49.339
And it should cause us to rejoice greatly that we should say, honor and glory forever

00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:52.460
and ever, amen.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.460
Let's pray.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.460
Father, we love you.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.740
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.500
We thank you for this portion of Scripture.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.940
We thank you, God, for the testimony of Paul.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.820
And I thank you that as we've had opportunity to rehearse his testimony this morning and

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:14.140
to see how he never got over the day that he got saved.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.420
God, maybe there's someone here this morning that needs to be saved.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:24.020
I pray that today they would bow their head and heart, place their faith and trust in

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.580
the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:34.460
Maybe this morning there's some saved folks that, Lord, we've just kind of gotten a little

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.700
calloused.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:42.020
We've kind of gotten used to being saved.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:53.899
Lord, I pray this morning that we'd revisit with freshness, rejoice in our salvation.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.100
Lord, help us to never grow cold.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:10.100
Lord, help us to be faithful to give you the glory, the praise that's due unto your wonderful

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.339
name.

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:13.899
Thank you for saving me.

00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:19.380
I pray, Lord, that you'd move and work in these moments as only you can.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.300
We'll be certain to give you the glory for it.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.740
It's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.740
Would you stand with me?

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.740
I pray, Lord, that you'd move and work in these moments as only you can.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.740
We'll be certain to give you the glory for it.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:25.740
