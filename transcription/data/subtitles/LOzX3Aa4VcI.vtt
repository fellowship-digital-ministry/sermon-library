00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.559
Timothy chapter number two, 1st Timothy chapter number two,

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:06.039
and last week we had a missionary with us

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.560
and the Whitfield family, they were here

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.880
and they are planting a church, Lord willing,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.020
in Edinburgh, possibly over in the second work

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.479
in Harrisonburg or in Winchester at the same time,

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:20.719
and so you pray for them.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.600
But they were here last week and so it's been two weeks

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.979
since we've been in the book of 1st Timothy.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.239
Of course, our theme this year, continue,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.799
and we're studying through the book of 1st

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.559
and 2nd Timothy here on Sunday mornings,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.959
and so two weeks ago we were challenged

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.000
as we began studying chapter number two of 1st Timothy

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.959
and we were challenged with the thought of structure

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.000
in our prayer lives, and in this verse,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in 1st Timothy two and verse number one,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.680
we find that God gives us some instruction

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.240
with regard to the priority of prayer,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.080
but we also mention the importance of having a plan.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.319
I believe that each and every one of us this morning

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.080
would agree that prayer is essential.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.520
Prayer is a great privilege.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.880
It's a great honor that we can come boldly

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.560
under the throne of grace and we know that we have a God

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.300
who hears and answers prayer.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.839
To God be the glory for that Bible truth,

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:10.279
and we find that I mention if we understand

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:12.199
that prayer is essential and we understand

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:14.279
that we ought to be engaged in prayer,

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.120
the thought of the message from two weeks ago

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
was that structure in our prayer lives

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.480
will really enable us to be consistent in our prayer lives.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.559
Some of us would admit, some of us maybe

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.480
would struggle to admit because we don't wanna

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.120
be embarrassed by it, but if we could be honest

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.680
and transparent this morning,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.480
consistency in our prayer lives is a real struggle.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.440
Prayer is work.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440
Prayer is a spiritual, engaged battle

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.279
when we get into the prayer closet,

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:47.279
and I'm thankful that God has given us instruction.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.440
We must be reminded of the truth that James 5, 16 ends with

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.599
when the Bible says this,

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.959
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.120
availeth much.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.559
I'm thankful that even in that text of Scripture,

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.959
the example of Elijah is used,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.440
a man that's a man just like you and I are human beings,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.800
and he prayed that it would not rain, and it did not rain.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.600
Why didn't it rain?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.759
Well, because he prayed according to the will

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.600
and word of God, and we find that he prayed again,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.020
and what happened, it rained.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.839
In between those two prayers, he prayed a prayer

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.880
and fire came down from heaven,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
and he said, I speak all this according to thy word,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.080
and we pray in confidence that God hears us and he answers.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.399
This morning, we'll focus our attention on verses two

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.080
and three as we consider the thought this morning,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.399
praying for leaders.

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.080
Notice with me in verse number one,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.479
the Bible says, I exhort therefore, that first of all,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.919
again, the priority on prayer,

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.360
Jesus said, my house should be a house of prayer.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.479
He says this, supplications, prayers, intercessions,

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.240
and giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.600
I'll be honest with you this morning,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.119
as we begin looking at this portion of Scripture,

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.600
and we'll get to verses two and three

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.679
as our primary key passage for this morning,

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.399
we find that verse number one ends

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.479
by speaking about being made for all men,

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.440
and quite honestly, this morning,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
we probably all would be very happy

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.639
if there was a period there,

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.839
because the Holy Spirit of God gets very specific,

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.919
and the Holy Spirit of God gets very specific

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.039
in the text that we're gonna look at this morning,

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.559
and as he gets specific,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.440
it's an area in which many of us fail.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.440
It's an area in which many of us fail.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.160
See, when he says pray for all men,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.199
we can kinda make ourselves feel like we're obeying that,

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.679
but then he says in verse number two,

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:49.679
pray for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600
Why did the Holy Spirit of God get so specific?

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.039
You know why I believe?

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.960
Because these people, just like us people,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.520
I know that's not good English,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
we don't like to pray for kings

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.960
and those that are in authority,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.079
especially when they don't believe like we do.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.440
It's one thing to pray for your brother and your sister,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.200
it's one thing to pray for your spouse,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.640
it's one thing to pray for your children

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.559
and your grandchildren,

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.119
it's one thing to pray for your church family,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.000
but the Holy Spirit of God gets real specific

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and says for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.799
Notice that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:46.480
in all godliness and honesty.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.200
Literally the idea of peace from without

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.000
and peace from within.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.279
He says in verse number three,

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.920
for this is good and acceptable

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.720
in the sight of God our Savior.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.519
Now these verses and this instruction

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.760
that is contained therein,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.239
this is the word of God.

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.959
This is inspired scripture,

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.559
the Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.600
and these verses of scripture must not be ignored

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.079
and they must not be disobeyed.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:18.359
I am aware this morning of the political tension

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:20.959
that exists in the United States of America.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.959
I am aware this morning and I realize

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.920
that some may be tempted to shut down the preacher

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.880
so to speak when it comes to a passage like this,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.640
but I would encourage you this morning to not do that.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.160
I would encourage you this morning

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.880
as some perhaps would like to ignore it.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.200
Some would like to just turn it off so to speak

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.920
and some maybe would seek to justify

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.880
their disregard for this instruction.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880
Will you understand?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.399
No, no, God wrote it and He understands everything.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.959
He is eternal.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.640
He knew what was gonna happen today

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.160
far before any of us had any concept

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.200
of what was gonna happen

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.880
and He knows what's gonna happen tomorrow

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.880
and thereafter and thereafter.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.720
He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.760
the first and the last.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.959
He is outside of time and He is the all wise God

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:14.559
and He chose to tell us

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.799
and for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.559
Understand with me this morning

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:27.279
that we are accountable for these verses of scripture.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.959
Understand this morning that we are to be doers of the word

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.640
and not hearers only, James 1 and verse 22.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.320
Furthermore, when this instruction was first given,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.320
it's important for each of us to understand

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.119
that the ruthless tyrant Nero

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.239
was the one that was the Roman emperor

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.320
and even in that time, Paul in prison,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.480
soon to be executed,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.880
God would use him to say, pray for all men

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.959
but then he says for kings

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.200
and for all that are in authority.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.679
Notice with me if you're taking notes,

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:13.760
the title just simply praying for leaders.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.320
Notice with me this morning,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.920
number one, just two thoughts this morning,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.839
several sub points if you will

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.760
but number one, if you're taking notes,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.040
the command to pray for leaders is clear.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.239
I mean, there's nothing confusing

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:29.160
about these verses of scripture.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.320
The command is clear, it is crystal clear.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.880
Admittedly this morning,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.519
it is far easier for us to criticize

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:41.160
and to complain about elected officials

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.880
than it is to pray for them.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.959
In fact, if we'd be honest this morning,

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.720
most of us, if we were to examine

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.839
the last seven days of our lives,

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:52.279
we probably are guilty of two things.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:55.640
One, criticizing and complaining about elected officials

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.559
and number two, not praying for them.

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:01.119
You say, pastor, it's getting tough today.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:04.799
I know, I had to prepare this all week, okay?

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:09.799
It's God's word, it's God's word.

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:12.600
And this morning, the reality is that

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.160
when he says to pray for kings

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.119
and all that are in authority,

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:20.519
we understand this morning that this command is clear

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.440
and we could ask ourselves the question,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.359
how is it that we should pray for leaders?

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:26.799
Well, really the most primary way

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.920
that we should pray for leaders is that they be saved.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.760
In fact, in our passage of scripture,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.000
if you notice in verse number four,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.320
we'll deal with it next week,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.320
it says who will have all men to be saved

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.159
and to come under the knowledge of the truth.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.880
First and foremost, the way that we ought to pray for leaders

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.320
is that they would be saved by the grace of God.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.679
I've had the opportunity,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:51.400
not with all of our elected officials,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.159
but with some of our elected officials,

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:55.679
I've had the opportunity to personally

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.239
share the gospel with them.

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:02.119
I sat in Mr. Connolly's office, who was our US Congressman,

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:05.440
Mr. Cain and Mr. Warner would not meet with me,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.840
but I met with Mr. Connolly

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.559
and I personally shared the gospel with him.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:13.840
He is a lost man, but he needs to be saved.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.119
He needs to be saved.

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:17.479
By the way, you understand why lost people

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:19.239
behave like they do?

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:20.479
Because they're lost.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.320
It's hard enough to get saved people

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.679
to act like saved people.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.000
Is it not true?

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:30.840
But you try to get some lost people

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.039
to act like saved people.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.559
To think like and to, no, no,

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:36.280
the Bible says that the natural man receiveth

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.479
not the things of the spirit of God

00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:38.799
for their foolishness unto him,

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.200
neither can he know them, why?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.119
Because they are spiritually discerned.

00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:46.039
How can we expect a lost person to vote

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:49.760
or to legislate like a saved person?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.960
We can't.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.799
So what do we pray?

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.719
We pray for their salvation.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.559
We pray that God would bring circumstances

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:58.200
and people into their lives

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.400
that would have boldness to speak the truth.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.160
truth of God. You think about the Apostle Paul, as God gave him opportunity to stand

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.480
before leaders, to stand before those who had great authority, to stand before kings.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.100
You know what Paul did? He shared the gospel with them. We do not see where Paul stands

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.520
before the leaders. If you study the book of Acts and say, let me plead my case, let

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.160
me tell you why I'm innocent, let me tell you why I should be released. You know what

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.320
Paul does? He takes and he seizes the opportunity to preach the gospel. Why? Because Festus

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:37.640
and Felis and Agrippa, they needed to be saved. Festus, Felis, I think I said Felis, Felis

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.240
and Agrippa. They needed to be saved. You know what Agrippa says? Festus, he says, you're

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.800
mad. He's under such conviction. He says, get out of here. Agrippa says, almost. Now

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:57.440
persuade us to be a Christian. Pray for their salvation. We've got a lot of leaders that

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.640
are lost. A lot of leaders that are lost. The temptation for every one of us, and I

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.440
hear it and I'm guilty of it myself, is the temptation is that we complain and we criticize

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.080
at the same time that we're ignoring what God said that we're to do. God didn't say

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.720
complain about them. He didn't say criticize them. He didn't say protest against them.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:31.280
He said pray for them. Now that's convicting. That steps on your toes because we're guilty

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:38.040
this morning. We should pray for their salvation. Let me ask this question. Obviously, I'll

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.520
say this. How should we pray for them? If you do have an elected official that's a saved

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.440
person, you should pray that God will protect them and that God will help them to live righteously,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.880
that God will help them to have courage and boldness to stand for truth. There are some

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.240
elected officials in our nation, in our state, that are saved people I have met with and

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.360
I have heard personally people share their testimony of salvation. I have had the privilege

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.240
of shaking the hands of some of our elected officials that stood up without any compromise

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.000
whatsoever and proclaimed their faith in Jesus Christ. There are not many of them, but there

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:24.040
are some. Well, we need to pray for them. Why? Because they're in a dead alliance, honestly.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.880
We need to pray for those to be saved that are lost, but we need to pray for those that

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.000
are saved to have courage and boldness and not to quit and say, you know what, this is

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.640
hard and it's difficult and every day there are challenges. No, that God would give them

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:44.640
some strength to be able to stick in and fight the good fight.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.640
Why should we pray for leaders? Well, number one, very simply, it's a matter of obedience.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.720
Because if you don't, you're disobedient. You say, well, that's pretty direct. Yeah,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.400
that's what the Bible says. To him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:07.400
sin. We don't like that word a whole lot. God, if I messed up. No, you sinned against

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:15.200
a holy God. Amen? So, it's a matter of obedience. We're to be doers of the word and not hearers

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.400
only. We can't take, we've been teaching in Sunday School about the King James Bible.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.480
We're not going to take a pen knife and just remove verses like so many of the modern versions

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.680
do. But why is it that we say, no, we have the King James Bible, but then we just ignore

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.680
certain portions of Scripture? Is it not the same thing? We find this morning, we have

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.240
the King James Bible, and we say, why should we pray for leaders? Well, number one, it's

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.000
a matter of obedience. Number two, it pleases God. Notice what the Bible says in verse number

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
three, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. You know what?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.840
If we find something as explicit as this, that God plainly says to us, this is good

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.000
and acceptable and pleasing in my sight, we ought to pay attention to that. And we're

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.320
to say, well, I ought to be engaged in doing that. In like manner, when God says, this

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.520
is displeasing, with many of them, 1 Corinthians 10, God was not well pleased. Let us take

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.880
note and say, I don't want to do those things because God is not pleased with those things.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.280
But here, explicitly, see, Ephesians says that we're to prove what is acceptable unto

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.960
the Lord. We examine the Scriptures, we dig in, what pleases God? Well, this verse is

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.920
a very plain verse. You don't have to dig real deep, you don't have to be a super intelligent

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.080
person to understand that the Bible says, this is good and acceptable in the sight of

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.840
God our Savior. All right, well, that pleases God. Proving what is acceptable. So, if it

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.980
pleases God, I ought to be doing it. Do you agree? Why would we not do something that

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:59.720
pleases God? Can I tell you in one answer, one word? Because of our flesh. What our flesh

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.600
wants to do? Wants to criticize and wants to complain. That's what our flesh wants to

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.800
do. Why should we pray for leaders? Number three, not only because it's a matter of obedience

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.760
and because it pleases God, but number three, because God is sovereign and He answers prayer.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.880
Because God is sovereign and He answers prayer. Hold your place here in 1 Timothy 2, but look

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.400
over, if you will, to the book of Proverbs. We're going to look at a few verses of Scripture.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.720
I'm so thankful to serve a sovereign God, aren't you? I'm so thankful that our God is

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.800
omnipotent. He has all power. He said, nothing is too difficult for me. And we have these

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.960
wonderful promises. Listen, we quote the promises when God says to Jeremiah, call unto me and

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.800
I will answer thee and show thee great mighty things which thou knowest not. We pray, understanding

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.360
the promise of Ephesians 3.20, now unto him which is able to do exceeding abundantly above

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.240
all that we ask or think. You say, no, God, we're not going to pray for those people because

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.000
they're hopeless, they're helpless. No, we serve a sovereign God who hears and answers

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.640
prayer, who is able. I don't know how He's always going to work and neither do you, but

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.120
when we study the Scriptures, we find that God works in amazing, miraculous ways. No

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.120
doubt that there are some accounts that we could go to this morning that we see the heroes

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.560
of the faith that prayed not knowing how God was going to work, but they believed.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:37.600
And they prayed. And God worked. Notice Proverbs 21. In Proverbs chapter 21, God gives us this

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.600
truth in verse number 1. Notice what the Bible says. Remember, we're praying for leaders,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.600
for kings and all that are in authority according to 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 2. And here

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:56.960
in Proverbs 21 and verse number 1, the Bible says the king's heart is in the hand of who?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.360
The Lord. That's my God. That's your God. That's the one that hears your prayers and

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.800
hears my prayers. That's the one that answers our prayers. The Bible says that the king's

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.040
heart is in the hand of the Lord. Notice it says, as the rivers of water, He. Who is He?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:20.120
That's the Lord. That's God. He turneth it. What's it? Well, that's the king's heart.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:30.760
Amen? You follow? Withersoever He. Who's He? The Lord will. Do you notice that verse? That's

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.520
a powerful verse of Scripture. The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. And He,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.800
the Lord, as the rivers of water, and He, the Lord, turneth it withersoever He, the

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.920
Lord will. Wow. Why should we pray for leaders? Well, because it's a matter of obedience,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.960
number 1. Number 2, because we find that it pleases God. But number 3, because we serve

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.320
a sovereign God who is in control of all things that hears and answers prayer. Keeping

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.920
in mind the truth of Proverbs 21 and verse number 1, turn back to the book of Ezra, if

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.840
you will. Turn back to the book of Ezra and turn to chapter number 7. Ezra chapter number

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:15.480
7. If you know anything about the history of this portion of Scripture, Ezra and Nehemiah,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.520
they're post-exilic books. They're written historically recording for us the events that

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:29.000
happen after the Babylonian captivity. And after the Babylonian captivity, 70 years as

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.440
prophesied by Jeremiah, the 70 years are fulfilled. Daniel understands that as he's reading the

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.720
books. We see that in the book of Daniel. And we find, in fact, we're going to look

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.160
at 2 Chronicles here in just a moment. Maybe I should have looked at that one first. But

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.280
let me just reference it. You stay here in Ezra. But in 2 Chronicles chapter 36, at the

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.880
end of the 70 years, in 2 Chronicles 36, notice what the Bible says in verse 22. It says,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.680
now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.800
of Jeremiah might be accomplished. Not because it was Jeremiah's word, but it was God's word

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:08.360
spoken through Jeremiah of 70 years of captivity. Why? Because of their disobedience. And they

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.160
were taken into Babylonian captivity, but God promised that a remnant would return.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.800
And we find that the Bible says, notice in the middle of verse 22 of 2 Chronicles 36,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:30.440
the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia. Who started up? The Lord.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.800
What did he stir him up to do? Well, that he made a proclamation.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.200
Cyrus, he makes a proclamation. You know what he says? It's throughout all his kingdom. And put

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.440
it also in writing, saying, thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, all the kingdoms of the earth

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.680
hath the Lord God of heaven given me, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:59.320
which is in Judah. Really? After the temple's destroyed and after the Babylonian captivity,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.600
when the Babylonians come...

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.080
in and destroy and everything that happens and we find that he says God has

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.240
given me a charge he puts it in writing that God charged me to build a house in

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.880
Jerusalem and then he says who is there among you of all his people the Lord has

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.880
God be with him and let him go up you know who did that God God did it in

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.280
Ezra they're there and there's all sorts of things in fact we can look at a

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.920
number of examples there in the book of Ezra in the book of Nehemiah how God was

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.920
working and how God was moving and the opposition came and the opposition sent

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.680
letters and said command that they stop you know what the letters came back no

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.080
actually continue on and you guys give them all the resources that they need

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.960
and if you refuse to do it you're put to death Wow that's pretty significant

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.160
who's doing that God the Lord the Lord you say but God can't do anything with

00:20:52.160 --> 00:21:03.440
our leaders really you have a small view of God notice in Ezra 7 in verse

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.560
number 27 they're rejoicing because of the letter that was received from our

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.040
desert sees the king and all that was going on I wish we had time to read all

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.720
of it but I just want to see what they say is the rejoicing in verse 27

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:24.440
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:33.360
where in the king's heart to beautify the house of the Lord which is where

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:47.480
it's in Jerusalem it's in Jerusalem this is written like 500 400 BC 450 BC okay

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.680
and Cyrus said all of you can return our exerts he's writes this letter all

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.520
these things are happening that a house the house of God the temple to be

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.520
beautified the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem what was God doing God

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.280
was working God was working it says the people of God recognized and they say

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.120
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this in

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:21.000
the king's heart why do we pray for leaders why does the scripture why does

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
the Bible tell us that were to pray for all men but then say for kings and for

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.080
all that are in authority well we should pray for them to be saved and if they're

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.000
saying we should pray that they would stand and they would grow and they would

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.160
be they would have courage as believers that they would live and act and vote

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.680
and legislate like believers and we find that if we understand and answer

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.800
the question why should we pray for leaders it's a matter of obedience it

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:55.120
pleases God and we serve a God who is sovereign who is able and he answers

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.480
prayer we find as I mentioned already by way of introduction that in verse number

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.080
two the Bible says that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.720
godliness and honesty notice the result when we're praying for those in

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.040
leadership we're praying for them we find that it says that we may lead a

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.040
quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty you know God gives us a

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.480
peace you know the peace that he gives us is that he's in control he's in

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.600
control you say did Jeremiah trust God yes did the Babylonians conquer Judah

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.580
yes because God said that was going to happen but you know Jeremiah was taken

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:41.500
well care of Jeremiah had a peace oh there are a bunch of people in Judah

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:49.020
that hated Jeremiah because of what he preached but God took good care of them

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.940
you know when Nebuchadnezzar and those guys came in they said you know what you

00:23:52.940 --> 00:24:02.820
let Jeremiah decide what he wants it's amazing it's amazing how God works God

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.500
can give us a listen when we go to God in prayer the answer might not always be

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:15.060
yes but we can have a peace that God is sovereign and God is in control and I

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:23.740
took this to God and I'm gonna let God be God amen and we find this morning

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:29.820
that I believe that in 1st Timothy chapter 2 when the Bible gives us this

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.700
command to pray which is crystal clear the command is clear that those that

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.180
would engage in obeying this verse of scripture these verses of scripture are

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.780
those that would be through their actions revealing their spiritual growth

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.140
and maturity notice in the book of Matthew if you will in Matthew chapter

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:54.580
5 I want you to notice what Jesus says Jesus is teaching in Matthew 5 we're

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.660
familiar with the passage of scripture but I want to focus in just as it

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.420
applies to this portion of scripture in 1st Timothy 2 in verses 43 through 48 in

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:09.900
Matthew chapter number 5 notice what the Bible says ye have heard in fact through

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.220
this portion of scripture you'll see this contrast where Jesus says ye have

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:22.300
heard or it hath been said and then Jesus says but I say unto you so here's

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.980
what you've heard here's what you've maybe had as a tradition but here's what

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:32.380
I'm saying to you and notice in verse 43 ye have heard that it hath been said

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.580
thou shalt love thy neighbor notice and hate thine enemy well that's pretty easy

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:45.700
to do in the flesh you know you love people that love you it's easy to do is

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:51.700
it not it's a whole nother ballgame to love somebody that hates you do you

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.300
agree notice he says that this is what you've heard notice verse 44 but I say

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:11.940
unto you love your enemies love your enemies bless them that curse you do

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:23.860
good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:30.420
persecute you is there anything easy about verse 44 is there anything in your

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:38.100
flesh or in my flesh that can do verse 44 it's only with the help of God it's

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:43.020
only with the Spirit of God enabling us to be able to bless those that curse us

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.580
to love those that hate us to pray for those who persecute us that's just not

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:55.700
normal it's not natural humanly speaking why'd you hit him you ask the kid in the

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.860
nursery because he hit me how many of you heard that how many of you said that

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:08.820
amen why'd you hit him I remember my little nephew Carter sweet little kid

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.580
man he's he's older now but I remember man he was like five years old him and

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.580
Michaela were fighting and my brother called him in and said Carter did you

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:25.900
hit her yes I mean he wasn't trying to hide it he wasn't lying yes Carter why'd

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:32.380
you hit her cuz she hit me I mean like that's just a natural thing this is not

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:41.100
natural this is spiritual this reveals spiritual maturity this is this is

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.340
spiritual growth he says in verse 45 that ye may be children of your father

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.340
which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.140
sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if ye notice verse 46 if ye love

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.780
them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.220
he's using the example of the publicans listen the people that love the

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:08.740
publicans they loved them back he says if you salute your brethren only what do

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.740
you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.700
complete even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Wow the command to

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:26.900
pray for leaders is clear number two this morning the failure to pray for

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:37.580
leaders is common the command is clear but the failure is common this week I

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:43.340
said I had the great privilege of preparing this message all week can I

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:48.500
tell you that I had to pray and confess my disobedience to God you know why I'm

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.580
just like you it's easier to complain and criticize what our elected officials

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.260
are doing than it is to pray for them I hope you don't think anything less of me

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:04.020
I'm just being honest but I have a God who said that if I confess he forgives

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:09.580
and I had to get on my knees and I had to say God I've failed I know what your

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:15.700
word says and I've disobeyed it because I have not prayed for those that are in

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.460
like I should you know what I did I took it a step further I went and I got all

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.980
the names of the people that I need to be praying for I say all not every

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.860
single congressman and senator but the ones that are in our area the Board of

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:36.940
Supervisors here in Fairfax County the state legislators their enrichment that

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.620
represent our district I went I wrote all the names down why because I'm the

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.500
for you say well pastor you should add a whole lot more to that list I'm starting

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:55.380
there amen I'm starting there why because every time you hear the news and

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.740
you see something else going on it's easy to complain and criticize but God

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.100
says

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:11.700
Pray. Pray for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.820
I told you already, I've had the privilege of sitting and sharing the gospel with several of these elected officials.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:25.060
But you know, that does not excuse me from praying for them thereafter.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.460
My job was not complete when I sat and shared the gospel with them.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.540
That was an appropriate thing to do, but my job didn't end there.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.660
I've got to still pray for them.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.900
And I hope this morning that as we look at the sad reality within our churches this morning,

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.420
within our nation this morning, I think this is a common problem.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.540
I think, listen, you know what Peter says? That judgment must begin at the house of God.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.980
That's what Peter said. He said, Pastor, I didn't come to church today to hear all this.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.260
I know, but bless God. Amen.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:03.740
We need it. If we're going to have revival in America, we better obey God's word.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.500
And we're disobedient in this area. I'm just saying we're disobedient in this area.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.460
I can't speak for every single person, but I know I talk to a lot of people

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.420
and I hear a whole lot more frequently about criticizing and complaining

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.220
than I hear of anybody talking about praying for our leaders.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.100
I hear it far too often. I hear it from church members.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.460
I hear it from other pastors. I hear it from evangelists.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.420
I just hear it all the time.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.500
And judgment must begin at the house of God.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.820
There's some people today that need to do what I did this week and say, God, forgive me,

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.300
and then decide I'm going to pray for leaders as you commanded me to do so.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.220
You say, but I don't like them. It doesn't matter if you like them.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.220
They're not the same party that I am. It doesn't matter.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.420
They don't think like I think. It doesn't matter.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.340
God said, pray for them. Pray for them.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.540
I said it in the beginning of the message this morning.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.700
I would have been happy if it stopped in verse number one, just pray for all men.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.460
Why? Because I could kind of make myself feel good about that.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.260
And so could you. I'm being honest this morning.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:20.380
But then he says the Holy Spirit of God, he brings that finger and just goes right at it

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.300
for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.300
Think about the original recipients of this book.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.500
Under heavy persecution, under the man Nero, the Roman emperor.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:43.820
And Paul says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, you want me to pray for him?

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.900
I think I would have thought that.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.300
We need to pray for the leaders.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.380
This morning, as I examine my own life, I mentioned already I've acknowledged my sin.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.220
I've asked God to help me with that.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:03.460
Far too often, we struggle to pray for those that are in leadership.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:08.980
I would say this this morning, many, and I would not put anybody on the spot,

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.900
but I would say that many, even within this crowd this morning,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:18.620
could not name, by name, the elected officials that represent our district.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.060
You know what that means to me?

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.100
You're not praying for them.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.380
If you can't name them, you're not praying for them.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.420
You say, Pastor, that's a bold statement.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.620
Tell me it's not true.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.220
Because I just prayed, God bless all of them.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.940
Give me a break.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.860
That's shallow praying.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.980
It really is.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:53.020
If we can't name them, we're not praying for them.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.020
I think there are three actions that we need to take,

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:01.380
three things that I want to leave you with this morning.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.980
He says in 1 Timothy 2 and verse 1,

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.780
I exhort therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions,

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.340
and giving of thanks be made for all men,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.180
for kings, and for all that are in authority,

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.300
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.180
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:30.620
Number one this morning, we must acknowledge that God is sovereign.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.020
We must acknowledge that God is sovereign.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:38.460
And as our sovereign Heavenly Father, He knows all things,

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.580
He's able to do all things, and He's able to work.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.620
And remember, the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:53.060
He, God, as the rivers of water, He turneth it withersoever He will.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.540
We must acknowledge that He is sovereign.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.860
When we understand that this morning, it will transform our prayer lives,

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.660
because we're praying to a God who is able.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:12.540
Number two this morning, we must accept the instruction that's given to us here.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.660
We must accept this instruction.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.540
Lord, this is for me.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.660
You said that you gave us your word, and we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.620
And we accept this instruction to be God's word and to be true.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.540
And then I would say this, we must analyze our prayer lives.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.100
We must analyze our prayer lives.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.860
Especially this morning with regard to how the Holy Spirit specifically deals with the

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.500
subject of praying for leaders.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.540
We must analyze.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.660
We must get along with God.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.820
We might need to visit an altar.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.420
We might, God, how am I doing in this area?

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.220
How am I doing?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.700
Can I encourage you this morning to be honest with God?

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.140
Because God knows how you're doing.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.980
God knew how I was doing.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.140
And God's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.860
See sometimes we say, look at what's going on in our nation.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860
It's all a mess.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.260
When's the last time you prayed for the leaders?

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.420
When's the last time we prayed for them?

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.460
I mean fervently.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.220
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:33.180
When's the last time we got on our knees for our president and prayed that that man

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.180
would be saved?

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.140
Or our vice president, that she would be saved?

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.100
You say, I don't like them.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.100
Stop.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.100
Stop.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100
Don't justify.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:49.420
It's a matter of obedience.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.020
And it pleases God.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.020
And He's sovereign and He's able.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:02.300
Purposefully this morning I'm stopping early because I think God needs to, let me say it

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.860
this way, I think God's people need to respond to God.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860
I just really believe that.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:14.820
And so we're going to have a little longer invitation this morning as God leads.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:21.300
I'm not going to belabor it just to belabor it, but I want to do business with God.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:28.300
The reality this morning is that this is not the kind of message I like preaching.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:35.300
Man, I like preaching messages that are just, let's go after it, let's get it, man, God.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.300
This is a tough one.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.300
Why?

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:42.020
Because it steps on my toes and I know it steps on your toes.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.740
But how do we respond?

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:51.340
So often as I pray, I pray that God would help us to receive His Word and then that

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.140
we would respond to His Word.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.580
Never do I try to be emotional and twist people's arms in invitations.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.580
I don't do that.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.580
You know that.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.300
But I really believe we need to do some business with God today.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.300
Let's pray together.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.240
Father, we love You.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.100
We thank You for loving us.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:17.340
I thank You that it's Your will that all men would be saved.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.380
We thank You that You hear and answer prayer.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:26.820
God, You've told us plainly that the instruction to pray for leaders is clear.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:37.220
There's nothing confusing for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:49.340
God, I believe this morning that the failure of Your people to pray is common.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:39:01.820
It's on the list, no doubt, of the most impactful sins of this generation is a disregard of

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.220
Your people to pray as You've instructed us to do so.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:12.300
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation, You would do a work in our hearts and lives.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:19.660
God, that we would confess and get right and that we'd develop a plan to pray for our

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:26.340
leaders that You might give us peace as a result.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.540
Criticizing them and complaining about them has never brought me peace.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:40.620
But as we pray and leave it with You, we can have a peace that passes all understanding.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:48.820
I pray that You would save those elected officials that are lost.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.180
I pray, God, that You would strengthen and give courage to those elected officials that

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.140
are saved.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:01.060
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can in these moments of invitation, which

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.140
in Christ's name we pray.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.940
Would you stand with?
