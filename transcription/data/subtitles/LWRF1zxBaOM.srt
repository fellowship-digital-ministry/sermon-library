1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
The Bible study is at 10 a.m.

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,039
And if you have any questions about that,

3
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:04,980
you could let Holly know,

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,440
she's downstairs teaching tonight,

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
but she'd be more than happy to give you some information.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,399
And then the last thing I'll mention

7
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,600
is with regard to the breakfast

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,479
on Resurrection Sunday morning,

9
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,239
7 a.m. sunrise service,

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,399
eight o'clock breakfast,

11
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,360
and then 9 a.m. the church service.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,680
If you're able to help us with bringing something

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
for that breakfast, we'd appreciate it.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,399
And if you wanna chat with Holly,

15
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,840
I made that announcement on Sunday evening.

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,120
I know that a couple of you chatted with her,

17
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,559
but if you'd be willing to help out with something,

18
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,680
that would be a blessing.

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,939
And she'll be able to give you some direction with that.

20
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,400
1 Thessalonians tonight,

21
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,759
as we have an opportunity to open the word of God

22
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,720
and to continue with our study

23
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,060
through 1 Thessalonians five,

24
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,599
and then 2 Thessalonians three,

25
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:46,919
eventually we'll get there.

26
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,799
And this is our 10th lesson on this subject

27
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,200
that I entitled really this series,

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,959
Walk Worthy, Please God.

29
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:59,080
And as believers, as the children of God,

30
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:00,759
we ought to walk worthy.

31
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,360
We ought to have a desire in our lives

32
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,720
that we wanna please the Lord

33
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,760
through all that we say and all that we do.

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,559
And we find that the church in Thessalonica,

35
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:08,800
as we've mentioned many times

36
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
in studying through this portion of scripture,

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,180
they're a model church,

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,800
but God instructs them and gives them

39
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
some very pointed things.

40
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,160
I mean, the concise instruction commands

41
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,599
that are given beginning in verse number 12

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,279
down through the end of the chapter

43
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,400
are very easy to understand.

44
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,080
They're very applicable in our lives.

45
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,639
And I've said this as we've studied

46
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,839
through these particular verses

47
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,639
that in each of these commands,

48
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,800
there's an action that's required.

49
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,760
We respond to what God has instructed us to do.

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,040
Obviously, the church at Thessalonica

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,279
is the original recipients of,

52
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,680
they are the original recipients

53
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,120
of this particular instruction,

54
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,379
but God has seen fit to preserve this instruction

55
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,440
throughout the church age

56
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,639
so that every local church can understand

57
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:57,199
how we should walk worthy and please God.

58
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,480
By the way, as a local church,

59
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,660
we ought to have a desire individually as Christians,

60
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,599
but as a local church,

61
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,440
we ought to have a desire

62
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,019
that we're a church that pleases God, amen,

63
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,240
that we're a church that God can look at

64
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,399
and his smile would be upon us

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,559
and he would see it appropriate

66
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,779
to be able to send people to us

67
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,720
knowing that we'll be faithful to preach the word of God.

68
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,399
And that is our desire.

69
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,000
That is what we want to do.

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
I do not want to be in a position

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,759
where God is not pleased with us,

72
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,399
where we could see where it's been referenced before

73
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:31,039
that Ichabod would be written upon the ministry.

74
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,039
No, we don't want the glory of the Lord to depart.

75
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,559
We want to be pleasing in God's sight

76
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,100
and to have God's favor upon our ministry.

77
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,679
This evening, we enter into the 17th verse.

78
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,000
A couple of weeks ago, of course, I wasn't here last week

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,460
and Brother Mark preached last Wednesday evening,

80
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,360
but two weeks ago, we dealt with verse 16.

81
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Rejoice evermore this evening, verse 17.

82
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,720
The Bible says pray without ceasing.

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
And it's a simple verse of scripture,

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,899
but how much God gives us in three simple words,

85
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,399
pray without ceasing.

86
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,639
If you're taking notes tonight,

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,440
that's what I've titled the message.

88
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,300
And tucked in the midst of two commands,

89
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,660
verse 16 and verse 18, regarding praise and thanksgiving,

90
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,479
we find that we are instructed to pray without ceasing.

91
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,199
This evening, I believe that each of us know

92
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,600
that we have been instructed to pray.

93
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,679
In fact, we probably would all agree

94
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,759
on the importance of prayer.

95
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,100
Indeed, the Lord wants his church to be a praying church.

96
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,699
We dealt with that on Sunday morning.

97
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,559
A praying church, we look in the book of Acts

98
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,039
and we find in the book of Acts,

99
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,279
as you study through the book,

100
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,520
you find that God used the early church

101
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,479
to accomplish some great things.

102
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,199
He was working in and through them.

103
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,300
There were a group of believers

104
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,240
that were filled with the spirit of God.

105
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,279
There were a group of believers

106
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,539
that were anxiously expecting the return of Christ,

107
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,399
but there were a group of believers that believed in prayer

108
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,080
and they practiced prayer.

109
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,440
And we find that they were a praying church

110
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,279
and what a blessing that is for us to understand.

111
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:06,039
In Luke chapter 11, we're told that one of the disciples

112
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,839
came to Jesus and said this,

113
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,759
"'Lord, teach us to pray.

114
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,699
"'Lord, teach us to pray.'

115
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,260
We're reminded then in Luke 18, Jesus said this,

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,260
"'Men ought always to pray and not to faint.'"

117
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,220
As we exam the command that is before us this evening,

118
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,040
this instruction of pray without ceasing,

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,779
this instruction that's given to the church at Thessalonica

120
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,799
and really tonight given to us as well,

121
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,739
we are reminded of some important principles.

122
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,140
Number one, if you're taking notes,

123
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,700
I want you to be reminded of the fact

124
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,500
that we have, of the access that we have.

125
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,200
We are reminded of the access that we have.

126
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,480
What do I mean by that?

127
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,320
Well, when we find in the scriptures that God,

128
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,679
of course, all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

129
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:57,679
we find that God says to his church, pray without ceasing.

130
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,320
He says to individual believers, pray without ceasing.

131
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
And when we understand this command,

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,839
when we understand the instruction,

133
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,799
we are reminded of the access that we have.

134
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:08,880
Why do I say that?

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,480
Because if we're instructed to pray without ceasing,

136
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,179
then it reveals to me that God is always available.

137
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,019
Amen?

138
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,839
There's never a time, there's never a place

139
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,600
when God is unavailable.

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,679
There's never a time where God says, no, not right now.

141
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,839
Have you ever been in a situation?

142
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,720
In fact, I got a phone call today

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
while I was on another phone call.

144
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,880
And I had to send a text message back and say,

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,600
hey, listen, I can't talk right now, I'm on the phone.

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,679
Is it an emergency?

147
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,359
And maybe you've had situations like that.

148
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,359
We're human beings.

149
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,399
But God is, he's God.

150
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,600
And he can listen to all of us at the same time.

151
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,640
And he can say to his people, he can say to his church,

152
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,040
pray without ceasing.

153
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,920
And I hope tonight that as we look at this instruction,

154
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
that we look at this command,

155
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,839
that we understand our responsibility.

156
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,320
And we're gonna get to that in just a moment.

157
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,720
But I hope that we would be encouraged

158
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,239
with the truth that this piece of instruction,

159
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:10,440
pray without ceasing, reminds us of the access

160
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
that we have to the throne of grace.

161
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
In Hebrews chapter four, if you take a moment

162
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
and turn over to the book of Hebrews,

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,040
we'll actually look at a couple of passages

164
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,119
in the book of Hebrews.

165
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,959
In Hebrews chapter number four,

166
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,200
it's a verse of scripture that many of us are familiar with

167
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,279
where the Bible teaches us, instructs us

168
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,519
with regard to our approach to the throne of grace.

169
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,399
And Hebrews four and verse number 16,

170
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,040
the Bible says, let us therefore come boldly

171
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,600
unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,279
and find grace to help in time of need.

173
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,679
We find that the psalmist says, lift up your eyes

174
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,799
into the hills from whence cometh your help.

175
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,720
But we find that in a previous psalm,

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,959
the psalmist also says that our God is a very present help

177
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,559
in the time of trouble.

178
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,559
And no doubt this evening that when we look

179
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,040
at this instruction to pray without ceasing,

180
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,679
that we are reminded of the access that we have.

181
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:10,000
Indeed, the veil has been rent.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,839
Amen?

183
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,160
I mean, think about the Old Testament.

184
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,679
Listen, in the Old Testament with the tabernacle

185
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:18,239
and then even with the temple, access was not available.

186
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,359
They could not, listen, if you were just a Jewish person,

187
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,839
you could not enter into the holy place.

188
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,899
You definitely couldn't enter into the holy of holies.

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,239
If you were the high priest, only once a year

190
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,079
on the day of atonement could you enter

191
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,799
into the holy of holies.

192
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,920
And that, you better make sure you have blood.

193
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,200
And according to Hebrews, they had to first offer

194
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,640
for their own sin and then for the sin of the people.

195
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,440
But we have a great high priest, the Lord Jesus Christ,

196
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,480
who made an offering once himself.

197
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,880
He didn't have to make an offering for his own sin

198
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,019
because he's sinless, but he made an offering

199
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,399
for the sin of the world.

200
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,959
And in so doing, he granted us access

201
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,799
to this throne of grace.

202
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,920
And we find that when the Bible instructs us

203
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
to pray without ceasing, that we are reminded

204
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,559
of this great access that we have.

205
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,720
In Hebrews chapter 10, look at it with me.

206
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
We'll read a few verses.

207
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,940
In fact, I wish I could read all of Hebrews 9 and 10

208
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,839
to you this evening and just rejoice

209
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,920
in what we have in Christ and what he's accomplished for us.

210
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,459
But in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 19,

211
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,119
notice what the Bible tells us.

212
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,640
Having therefore, brethren, notice what it says,

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,799
boldness to enter into the holiest, how?

214
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,640
By the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way

215
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,260
which he hath consecrated for us through the veil,

216
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,520
that is to say, his flesh.

217
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,140
Verse 21, and having a high priest over the house of God,

218
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,799
let us draw near with a true heart

219
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,979
in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled

220
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,619
from an evil conscience and our bodies washed

221
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:03,539
with pure water, let us hold fast the profession

222
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,419
of our faith without wavering,

223
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,460
for he is faithful, that promised.

224
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,000
We can rejoice this evening in understanding

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,820
that when we come to this command,

226
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,059
this piece of instruction to pray without ceasing,

227
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,619
that yes, there is an action that's necessary on our part.

228
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,260
We ought to be engaged in praying,

229
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,039
but we are reminded even before we take an action

230
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,760
of the access that we have.

231
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,000
I am so thankful.

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,599
Have you ever tried to call a place and they're closed?

233
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,719
Yeah, try to get in touch with somebody

234
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,559
and you can't reach them.

235
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,479
I mean, today, I remember what it was like 30 years ago,

236
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,960
and some of the kids that are over in the teen class

237
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,799
and downstairs, they have no understanding

238
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,539
of how this works, but I remember when you left home,

239
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,039
you were unavailable until you got somewhere

240
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,400
that had a phone, right?

241
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,640
We didn't have cell phones.

242
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,000
We weren't available all the time,

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,119
and we find that...

244
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,679
There were times in which perhaps somebody didn't reach the destination when you thought

245
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,799
they were going to reach the destination and you couldn't reach them.

246
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,559
Listen, I'm so thankful that we have access to the God of the universe.

247
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:21,799
And when He tells us, pray without ceasing, He is reminding us of the access that we have.

248
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,399
He didn't just give us certain hours.

249
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,119
No, we have access all the time.

250
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,999
You have a need?

251
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:34,639
Doesn't matter the hour, doesn't matter what the need is, you have access to the throne

252
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
of grace.

253
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,399
And what a joy that is.

254
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,319
Not only does this instruction in 1 Thessalonians 5 remind us of the access that we have, but

255
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:49,919
I believe number two this evening, we are reminded of God's ability to answer prayer.

256
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,799
Why is it that it reminds me of the ability that God has to answer prayer?

257
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,639
Well, because God says pray without ceasing.

258
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,119
And so, therefore, if He instructs us, if He gives us that piece of instruction to pray

259
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,359
without ceasing, it is reminding us not only that we have access, but it's reminding us

260
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,979
of His ability.

261
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,399
Why would He tell us to pray?

262
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,359
Why would He tell us to come to Him if He doesn't have the ability to do something about

263
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,359
it?

264
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,519
And He has the ability, He has all the ability.

265
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,959
He is the omnipotent, all-wise God.

266
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:31,479
And so He says to His people, pray without ceasing, because He is able to answer prayer.

267
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:34,819
He's able to change the circumstances of our lives.

268
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,879
He's able to work through the circumstances of our lives.

269
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,519
He gives us the grace that we need.

270
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,759
In fact, we have found many times in our lives personally that His grace is sufficient.

271
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,719
His grace is sufficient.

272
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,919
This evening, I want you to take and turn to the book of Ezra, if you will.

273
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,499
Look at this Old Testament illustration of this truth that we're looking at this evening

274
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:06,639
in Ezra chapter number 8.

275
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,559
We see here in Ezra 8, there's prayer and fasting that takes place.

276
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,319
And we see God's ability to answer in Ezra 8, beginning in verse number 21.

277
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:37,399
See, they're trying to get to Jerusalem.

278
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,959
We're going to see that in just a moment, but they're taking a journey to Jerusalem.

279
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,239
And this journey that they're going to take to Jerusalem, there's going to be a lot of

280
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,759
danger along the way.

281
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,399
And so the Bible tells us that there's a fast that's proclaimed.

282
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,360
There's a seeking of God.

283
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
And what are they seeking?

284
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,639
Well, they're seeking that God would give them some direction, that God would provide

285
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,360
for them and give them the protection that they need.

286
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
But I want you to notice, verse 22 always impacts me.

287
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,759
Every time I read it, I'm impacted of the importance of us trusting the Lord.

288
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,339
Notice the Bible says, for I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers

289
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,799
and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way.

290
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:29,099
There are records, by the way, of others that requested such help and the help was granted.

291
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,399
In those circumstances, it does not necessarily say that it was wrong, but we find here in

292
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:42,159
Ezra that he says, I was ashamed to ask the king to provide for us soldiers and horsemen

293
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,519
that they would give us the protection that we needed along the way.

294
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,399
Why was it that he was ashamed to ask of that?

295
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:57,119
Well notice in verse 22, the Bible says, because we had spoken unto the king saying, the hand

296
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:02,759
of our God is upon all them for good that seek him, but his power and his wrath is against

297
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,039
all them that forsake him.

298
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:12,559
So in verse number 22, basically he's saying, we talk that our God is able, and he is.

299
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:19,119
And if our God is able, then I'm ashamed to ask the king to give us horsemen and to give

300
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,119
us soldiers.

301
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,119
Why?

302
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,199
Because we already told the king how our God is able.

303
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
And so guess what we're going to do?

304
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,639
We're going to trust our God.

305
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,199
We're going to trust our God.

306
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,199
And so what do they do?

307
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,199
So we fasted and besought our God for this.

308
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,199
That's prayer.

309
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,199
Prayer and fasting.

310
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:46,100
And I want you to notice the end of verse 23, it says, and he was entreated of us.

311
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,119
In verse 31, we'll skip down and look here.

312
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:55,639
It says, then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month

313
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,799
to go unto Jerusalem.

314
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,079
And then look at these words, I have them underlined in my Bible.

315
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,199
And the hand of our God was upon us.

316
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:13,279
Listen, there was danger, they say, in verse 22, that he was ashamed to ask of this help,

317
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,919
to help them against the enemy in the way.

318
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,160
There was going to be danger, but he says, the hand of our God was upon us.

319
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,479
We trusted the Lord.

320
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:25,820
We prayed and we fasted, and God is able.

321
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,979
So here he says, and he, the hand of our God was upon us and he delivered us from the

322
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:36,220
hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way.

323
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,139
Isn't that awesome?

324
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,699
God worked.

325
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,619
God worked.

326
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:50,540
Verse 32 says, and we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days.

327
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,959
I love how verse 31 begins and how verse 32 begins.

328
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,839
We departed and we came to.

329
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
God provided them with the mercies, the traveling mercies that they needed.

330
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,679
He provided them all the protection that they needed for the enemy that was in the way.

331
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,679
And we could look at a number of other passages of Scripture this evening with regard to God's

332
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,739
ability to answer prayer.

333
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:22,359
But we find here in Ezra chapter 8 an illustration how that people, that they seek the face of

334
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:29,959
God and in the midst of a serious situation, they determine that they're not going to rely

335
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,239
on the resources that might be available to them through some other means, but they're

336
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,239
going to trust the Lord.

337
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,399
They're going to prove God.

338
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,199
By the way, God likes to prove his power.

339
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,880
He likes to prove what he's capable of doing.

340
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,839
We're familiar with Jeremiah 33.

341
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,679
In fact, it's on our prayer bulletin every single week, call unto me and I will answer

342
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,119
thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

343
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,919
I want you to take and look at the book of Lamentations just for a moment in the third

344
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,399
chapter, Lamentations in the third chapter.

345
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:10,079
We think about that verse in Jeremiah 33, three in the wonderful promise that God gave

346
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,239
to Jeremiah.

347
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:21,639
In Lamentations chapter 3, we're often familiar with verses 21 and 22 and 23 and speaking

348
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:28,679
about the mercies of God and his faithfulness and what wonderful precious verses those are.

349
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,559
But I want to draw your attention this evening to verse 55 of Lamentations chapter 3.

350
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,000
And here in this verse of Scripture, notice what Jeremiah says.

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,919
He said, I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.

352
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,320
Thou hast heard my voice.

353
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,799
Aren't you thankful that God hears us?

354
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,760
And he has the ability.

355
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,079
Notice it says, hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.

356
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,239
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee.

357
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,600
Thou saidst, fear not.

358
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,679
You know, I think about the truth of verse 57 when the Bible says that Jeremiah says,

359
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,079
in the day that I called, thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee, thou saidst,

360
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,079
fear not.

361
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,959
I'm thankful that our God is a very present help in a time of trouble.

362
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:29,760
You know, sometimes he just says to his servants, to his people, fear not.

363
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,440
You know, there are times in your life, there are times in my life where we could fear the

364
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,520
circumstances that we're facing.

365
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,119
The circumstances could mount up and it could be overwhelming, it could cause fear in the

366
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,039
heart of God's people.

367
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,880
But we find that as Jeremiah testifies in Lamentations 3, he says, I called and you

368
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,200
drew near and you said to me, fear not.

369
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
What a blessing.

370
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm thankful for God's presence.

371
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,659
As we look at this passage of Scripture, this simple command in 1 Thessalonians 5,

372
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,779
verse 17, pray without ceasing, we're reminded, first of all, of the access that we have.

373
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,539
I believe that we're reminded, number two, of the ability that God has to answer prayer.

374
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:19,460
But number three, I believe that we're reminded of our, the proper attitude toward prayer.

375
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,059
What is the proper attitude toward prayer?

376
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:28,099
This is more the action part, if you will, of 1 Thessalonians 5, 17, when God says, pray

377
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,859
without ceasing.

378
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,419
This helps me to develop and to understand a proper attitude of prayer, to continually

379
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,460
to be in that state of prayer, if you will.

380
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,339
Prayer is not a mere religious exercise.

381
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:49,419
Prayer is not something that is reserved for only a specific time or a specific place.

382
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:55,900
Now, I hope this evening that you have a time and that you have a place that you have set

383
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,099
aside for prayer time, but understand with me this evening that

384
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,859
prayer, when God says pray without ceasing, there are two things that we

385
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:10,899
must understand. Number one, he does not mean by that that you and I are to 24

386
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:17,819
hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, only be engaged in praying. That's

387
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,539
not what he means by that. But we also understand that he does not mean that

388
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:27,739
you have set aside from 630 to 7 o'clock each morning or whatever your time is

389
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:32,059
that this is my prayer time and then all of a sudden that's the only time that

390
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:38,219
you ever pray. It's not the idea that we, oh well we pray for our meals, it's just

391
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:43,619
kind of, and by the way sometimes that can just be like rote religion. You know

392
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,299
what I'm saying? I heard somebody say once, well I asked them to pray for the

393
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:53,219
meal because I know they pray fast and they were hungry. It's not the idea. Amen?

394
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:58,539
It's not the idea. But sometimes if we're not careful it can just become mundane,

395
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:04,139
monotonous, right? And we find here this evening that when we think about our

396
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:09,859
attitude towards prayer, I believe that it's shaped very much by this verse of

397
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:17,179
Scripture when the Bible says pray without ceasing. Pray without ceasing. At

398
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:24,859
any time, for any reason, you, any child of God, can go to the throne of grace. Pray

399
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:33,819
without ceasing. To be in that state where it's almost like the line is open, if I

400
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:40,819
could use that phraseology. It's continually that at any time throughout the day we can

401
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:47,499
just enter into prayer. Something comes up, you hear about a request, something you just

402
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:52,579
can immediately go back and enter into the presence of God because we can pray without

403
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:59,579
ceasing. And we find that, let me just illustrate it biblically. Go to Nehemiah if you will,

404
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,859
Nehemiah chapter 1 and 2. We're going to look at both portions of Scripture. I believe

405
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,499
personally that this is probably the best illustration that I know of in the Scriptures

406
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:15,579
that really help us understand this idea of pray without ceasing. In Nehemiah chapter

407
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:22,579
1, we find that in this text of Scripture, Nehemiah requests a report. He asks how things

408
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:30,299
are in Jerusalem. We find that Nehemiah receives a response to the request that he makes and

409
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,819
he hears that they're in great affliction and reproach, that the wall is broken down,

410
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:40,259
the gates are burned with fire. You can see that in verses 2 and 3 of the request and

411
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,299
then of the report. But I want to draw your attention in chapter 1 to verse number 4.

412
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,619
The Bible says, and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept

413
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:55,739
and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. So what does Nehemiah

414
00:22:55,739 --> 00:23:02,739
do at the hearing of this report? Well, he's broken. What he does, he goes to God in prayer.

415
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:08,379
And you can read in verse number 5 where it says, and it said, I beseech thee, O Lord

416
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:13,619
God of heaven. Now I'm not going to read the entire prayer. But you can find that as you

417
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,939
read through the next several verses, down through the end of the chapter, that Nehemiah

418
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:25,939
is praying. He's praying. It's a time of prayer. He's seeking the face of God. The Bible tells

419
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:32,939
us that he wept, he mourned, he fasted, and he prayed.

420
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:37,619
Then we come to chapter number 2 and it says that it came to pass in the month Nisan in

421
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,019
the 20th year of Artaxerxes, the king, that wine was set before him and I took up the

422
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:49,659
wine and gave it unto the king. Notice the Bible says, now I had not been before time

423
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:55,819
sad in his presence. Wherefore, the king said unto me, why is thy countenance sad, seeing

424
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:01,859
thou art not sick? This is nothing else but, notice he says, sorrow of heart. Then I was

425
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:08,859
sore afraid. He said unto the king, let the king live forever. Why should not my countenance

426
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,379
be sad when the city, the place of my father's sepulchers, lieth waste and the gates thereof

427
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:19,739
are consumed with fire? Then the king said unto me, and I'm going to stop right in the

428
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:25,339
middle of this verse. It says, for what dost thou make request? I want you to understand

429
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,419
the scene in verse, chapter number 2. The scene in chapter number 1 is that he makes

430
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:34,739
a request. What's going on? He gets the report. He receives the report. It affects him to

431
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,819
the point where he's going to pray. And we could read, I'm not going to take the time,

432
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,139
I've already said that, you can read through the end of chapter 1, the prayer of Nehemiah.

433
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:48,099
You come to chapter 2 and now he's fulfilling his responsibility of being the cupbearer

434
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:52,819
and he's standing before the king and the king says, something's wrong. Have you ever

435
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:57,179
been able to tell in the countenance of an individual that there's a problem? Amen?

436
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,259
You can tell. If you know somebody well enough, you can tell in their countenance. Have you

437
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,459
ever heard somebody, you've seen somebody, you say, how are you doing? They say, man,

438
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:09,579
I'm doing great. And you're like, nah. Your words in your countenance, they're just not

439
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:16,579
in agreement. You've never been in that situation. And here the king recognizes in the countenance

440
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:21,699
of Nehemiah, his cupbearer, that there was something going on. He says, you're not sick.

441
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:28,699
This is nothing more than sorrow, nothing else, but sorrow of heart. Nehemiah reveals

442
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:36,579
the issue that's causing him to be sorrowful, the situation, the report that he had received,

443
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:42,019
and we find that the king then says, for what dost thou make request?

444
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:48,499
The next three words, where I stopped in verse number 5, say this, so I prayed to the God

445
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:55,499
of heaven, and verse number 5 then says, and I said unto the king. I want you to understand

446
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,779
this evening that I do not believe, as you read Nehemiah chapter number 2, that Nehemiah

447
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:06,379
was able to separate himself from the king and have some great season of prayer before

448
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,459
the God of heaven. No, when the Bible says in verse number 4, so I prayed to the God

449
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:17,399
of heaven, and I said unto the king, this illustrates for me, pray without ceasing.

450
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:24,639
In that moment when the king, listen, I don't think Nehemiah expected the king to even notice

451
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:31,439
that he had sorrow of heart. I don't think that Nehemiah expected that the king would

452
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:38,439
say, what's your request? Nehemiah's prayer was probably just a couple of words. Maybe

453
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:47,039
like we see in the Psalms, in Psalm 12, Lord help, help Lord.

454
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:54,399
Because the Bible says that he prayed to the God of heaven, and I said unto the king.

455
00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:01,399
And then he makes his request known. By the way, I believe that because he had the season

456
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,919
of prayer in chapter number 1, it reveals to us that he had a proper attitude towards

457
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,119
prayer when he's able to then just pray in that moment. Pray without ceasing. I'm going

458
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,759
to use Miss Joyce as an example this evening. Some of you have been able to visit her over

459
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,999
the last year. It's hard to believe it's been almost a year that she's been really

460
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:24,559
dealing with some health needs. And she's got a heart for people, she's got a heart

461
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,559
for souls, and I know that some of you probably could share this testimony of being able to

462
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,839
sit with her and visit with her and sing with her and read with her and whatever else is

463
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,119
going on. But I want you to think about this when I consider the thought of pray without

464
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,199
ceasing. I often think about Miss Joyce because you can be in the middle of talking to Miss

465
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:46,799
Joyce and you can be in the midst of having conversation and she'll ask you, well, how

466
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,519
is so and so doing? And you give an answer, she says, let's pray for them right now. You

467
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,119
just stop and you pray for that person and then you continue having conversation. And

468
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,159
then you talk a little while and you go through some things and she says, well, how is so

469
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:08,159
and so and let's pray for them right now. It's really kind of, it reveals to me someone

470
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:16,079
that has this pray without ceasing approach to prayer that in any moment, for any reason,

471
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:25,359
we can go to God. We have access. He has the ability and the truth of 1 Thessalonians 5.17,

472
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:35,119
pray without ceasing, should have an impact on us having a proper attitude towards prayer.

473
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:46,039
Prayer is not religious exercise. Prayer is not something that is to be memorized prayers

474
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:55,239
that we just written out prayers. It's not the idea. We're communing with our Father.

475
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:05,279
And I think about the opportunity that we have and as God says to us, pray without ceasing,

476
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,279
it reveals to me the heart of our Father. He wants to hear from us. He wants us to come

477
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,359
into His presence. And by the way, when we enter into His presence, it's not always with

478
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:24,359
a list of things that we want. It shouldn't be anyway. The times that you enter into His

479
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,519
presence just to praise Him, just to worship Him, just to thank Him for what He's done

480
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:37,559
for you. We find this evening, simple verse, impactful verse. Jesus said, men are always

481
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:48,119
to pray and not to faint. One disciple came and said, Lord, teach us to pray. And Jesus

482
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,719
instructed them. We find that to the church at Thessalonica and to every church throughout

483
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:00,119
the church age, we read this.

484
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,639
instruction in 1 Thessalonians 5.17, pray without ceasing.

485
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:12,559
I hope in your life that the line of communication between you and God is always open, that you

486
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,839
find yourself throughout the day, yes, I have my time of prayer, and then throughout the

487
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,639
day, for whatever reason, for whatever comes up, I can once again enter into the throne

488
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:29,599
room of God, throne room of heaven, and bring my request before Him, praise Him, worship

489
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,119
Him, something happens, say, Lord, thank you.

490
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,199
Thank you for sparing me from that.

491
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:39,719
You see an accident, you see a situation, someone shared a testimony before in church

492
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:45,839
where their children, any time they see an ambulance or a fire truck, they immediately

493
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:52,359
say, should we stop and pray for whoever's been affected, whoever those emergency personnel

494
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,919
are going to tend to, and that's awesome.

495
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:01,639
We're constantly in that spirit of prayer.

496
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:04,039
Pray without ceasing.

497
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,039
Let's pray together.

498
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,919
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for the privilege of being

499
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:17,159
able to enter into your presence, and God, we thank you that you're always available.

500
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:23,359
The access that we have, we're reminded of that access tonight by this verse of Scripture.

501
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,159
We thank you for the ability that you have to do anything.

502
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,719
We're reminded of that as we look at this verse of Scripture, and God, I thank you for

503
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:42,879
the way that this verse of Scripture should frame our attitude, our approach to prayer.

504
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:47,719
I thank you for the examples in the Scriptures that we can look to, and I pray that you'd

505
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,319
help us to be a people of prayer.

506
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,319
Thank you for it.

507
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,319
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

508
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:59,239
Does anyone need an update letter, a bulletin this evening, a prayer bulletin tonight?

509
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,239
Anyone need one?

510
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:00,519
All right.
