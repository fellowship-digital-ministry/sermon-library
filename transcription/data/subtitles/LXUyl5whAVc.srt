1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
of Judges, I mean the Old Testament, Judges chapter number 13, this morning, Judges chapter

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:15,979
number 13, and with each passing year, I realize personally what a great honor and responsibility

3
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:19,200
it is to have children.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,879
And I remember not long ago someone asked me this question, what is the hardest stage

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,680
of parenting?

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,720
And I said, the one that you're actively in.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,639
Sometimes people think, well I can't wait until these kids get older, and then they

8
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:43,639
get older and it's a whole new dynamic, I can't wait until these kids fill in the blank

9
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:49,580
and it's a whole other dynamic, but when they leave the house, it's a whole other dynamic.

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,200
Those of you that have had each of those stages, you understand, you also understand how quickly

11
00:00:55,279 --> 00:01:00,759
time goes, you wonder when they're going through that, we often refer to it as terrible twos

12
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,760
kind of a time, you say, when is this ever going to end?

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,959
And then you just seemingly blink an eye and they're teenagers, and then they're beyond

14
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,059
teenagers, and it's quite amazing, and I understand it's a great honor, great responsibility

15
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,059
to have children.

16
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:22,199
The Bible teaches us that children are inherited to the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is

17
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,639
His reward.

18
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:30,760
I can still remember with clarity, and it's not that long ago, but I can still remember

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,919
quite vividly when Holly told me that she was expecting our firstborn.

20
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:40,760
Of course that's Juliana, at the time we did not know whether it would be a boy or girl,

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,400
and so we remember that, I remember that day, and I remember her sharing that with me, and

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,080
I'll be honest with you, I had some mixed emotions immediately upon hearing that news,

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,559
I had some mixed emotions.

24
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:59,440
For one, I was excited, and I was thankful for the fact that God was blessing us with

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
a child.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,680
But at the very same time, I was nervous and fearful.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,080
Why?

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,960
Because I was aware of the great responsibility that it was to have children and to raise

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,320
children to follow the admonition that's on the front of the bulletin this morning, bring

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,399
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

31
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:25,880
And I remember thinking a couple of thoughts, really all at the same time, and I wondered

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,240
something like this, am I gonna know what to do?

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,899
I wondered something like this, am I really ready for this?

34
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:40,000
And I remember looking at Evan, November of, I guess it was, she was born last year, 2023,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
so November of 2022, and I remember looking at Evan and saying, are you sure that you're

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
ready to be a father?

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,479
And he said, oh yeah, and I said, oh my.

38
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,600
I think they're watching livestream this morning, but I thought to myself that when I found

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,199
out that we're having our firstborn, I immediately recognized I don't know that I'm ready for

40
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,199
this.

41
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,440
But you know what I learned through the years?

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,860
If you depend upon the Lord and you trust the Lord for the wisdom and the direction

43
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,039
that only He can give, that God will guide and God will direct and God will help.

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,919
The Bible teaches us that He's a very present help in the time of trouble, and He teaches

45
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,440
us in His Word that if we recognize that we lack wisdom, that if we ask that He will give

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
wisdom.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,720
And we'll reference that verse of Scripture as we go through the message this morning,

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,160
but the reality is that we come to Judges chapter number 13 this morning, and as we

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,199
come to this passage of Scripture in our text this morning, Manoah and his wife had no children.

50
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,119
We do not know their ages, but we do understand that the Bible tells us that Manoah's wife

51
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,119
was barren.

52
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,240
She had no children.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,880
But she received this announcement, she received word that she would have a son.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,000
If you begin reading with me in Judges 13 and verse number 1, the Bible says, and the

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,320
children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,399
the hand of the Philistines forty years.

57
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:12,320
And now as God gives us in verse number 1 the backdrop of what's going on in Israel

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,200
broadly speaking, the text of Scripture goes in to verse number 2 and begins to share with

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,179
us a particular family in Israel.

60
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:25,519
As we look at this text of Scripture, it says there was a certain man of Zorah of the family

61
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,160
of the Danites whose name was Manoah, and his wife was barren and bare not.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,640
And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her, Behold now, thou

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,399
art barren and barest not.

64
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,959
Notice this, but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.

65
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,640
We're going to look at the whole chapter, but I want you to skip down to verse number

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,920
8, if you will, and look at what the Bible says.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,839
Then Manoah entreated the Lord and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou did

68
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:59,959
send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

69
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,339
Skip down to verse number 12, Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass.

70
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:12,940
How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

71
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,179
If you've looked at the bulletin this morning, I've titled the message really from verse

72
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:21,019
number 12 of our text, How Shall We Order the Child?

73
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,220
How shall we order the child?

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,820
As we look at the text of Scripture and we think about Father's Day, and we understand

75
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,619
the great responsibility that it is to raise our children, I look at this question that

76
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:36,980
is asked of Manoah, and I look at this text of Scripture, and I find that God gives us

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,660
some instruction that is helpful.

78
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,179
Regardless of what stage you are in life, and quite honestly, whether you're a father

79
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:49,459
or not here this morning, the truth from Judges chapter number 13 is applicable to you and

80
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:55,579
will be helpful in your life as we look at this interaction between Manoah, his wife,

81
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:56,579
and the Lord.

82
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:02,380
Now, taking notes, number one this morning, there is a recognition of deficiency.

83
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,739
There is a recognition of deficiency.

84
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:12,140
In general, general terms this morning, human beings, especially men, if I could add that,

85
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,660
and all the ladies will appreciate it, they have a really hard time recognizing their

86
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
deficiencies.

87
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Human beings in general.

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,779
We have a hard time recognizing our deficiencies.

89
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,239
The fact of the matter is that God warns us many times in His Word about pride.

90
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:33,140
He warns us not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought.

91
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,940
He tells us that pride destroys, that pride, only by pride cometh contention.

92
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,339
He tells us that He resisteth the proud, and yet we continue to have difficulties in the

93
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,339
area of pride.

94
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,899
The Bible teaches us that we as Christians are to be clothed in humility, that we're

95
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:57,739
to humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord, but we find, generally speaking, we have difficulties

96
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,299
recognizing our deficiencies.

97
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:08,220
Unfortunately, this difficulty has a way of leading to even more difficulties in our lives.

98
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,179
We recognize, we fail to recognize that we have a deficiency, it's difficult for us to

99
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:19,820
acknowledge that, and because we do not recognize our deficiencies, it leads to more problems,

100
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,459
it leads to more difficulties and more trials in our lives.

101
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:29,299
And we find that this morning, that when we consider this idea of recognizing our deficiency,

102
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:37,019
or a recognition of deficiency, is that what happens when we fail to recognize that pride,

103
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:46,660
not only does it displease the Lord, but many times in our lives it leads to living independent.

104
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,540
Independent of God, and independent of the help that we can get from God, and if we're

105
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,980
not careful, when we go through life, if we fail to recognize the deficiency, we live

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,179
in a society that wants to puff ourselves up, to think that we know more than we really

107
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:08,019
know, to think that we're capable of doing more than we're really able to do, that we

108
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,859
don't need, but the reality is that we do need.

109
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,859
We're a needy people.

110
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:18,500
There's a short book that I read years ago, in fact, I gave it to several of our men at

111
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,299
that time, and it was a really short read, you could probably read it in 20 or 30 minutes,

112
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:28,540
and the book was titled, I Am Not Okay, and it was all about pride, and the reality is

113
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,840
that here in our text of Scripture, we find that there was a recognition of deficiency

114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,380
on the part of Manoah.

115
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,340
I believe that though, if we fail to recognize our deficiencies, it leads to independent

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:50,440
living, that when an individual recognizes their deficiencies, it reveals humility,

117
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,580
and it leads to dependent living.

118
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Listen, we, I understand that so often we speak about, I have my rights, I have my,

119
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,219
I'm independent, so on and so forth, but when we think about the Christian life, the Christian

120
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,900
life must be lived in dependence on the Lord.

121
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:13,700
In fact, Jesus said it this way, I am the vine, you're the branches, and He says this,

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,140
without me, ye can do nothing.

123
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,840
We must abide in Him.

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,039
Before we ever will follow that path, we must recognize our deficiencies.

125
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,700
As we look at the text of Scripture, I find that this man, Manoah, when he receives the

126
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:39,059
word from his wife with regard to the interaction that she had, that he recognized his deficiencies.

127
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:40,059
Why do I say that?

128
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:45,580
Well, because number two, if you're taking notes, there's a request for direction.

129
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,219
There's a request for direction.

130
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,739
I would submit to you this morning that no one is going to make a request for direction

131
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:55,020
unless they first recognize their deficiency.

132
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,419
Amen?

133
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,859
You're not gonna ask for help.

134
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,020
You're not gonna request direction.

135
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,860
if you think you got it, if you think you can handle it,

136
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,100
if you think you know the way,

137
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,540
you're not gonna ask for help.

138
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,300
I remember when we made the decision to drive,

139
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
well, we didn't really make the decision,

140
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,380
the Marine Corps changed duty stations for my dad

141
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,480
and we were driving from New Jersey to Nevada.

142
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
And that was back in the day,

143
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,740
not only did you not have cell phones,

144
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,700
but you didn't even have those little Garmin GPS things,

145
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,740
you had the Rand McNally maps, amen?

146
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,300
You guys remember using those?

147
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,960
And it was, you'd look at the page

148
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,360
and then on the right-hand side,

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,040
it would say joins to page number or map number 41

150
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,280
and you'd flip on over and sure enough,

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,880
page 41 was the continuation of the map

152
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
and I sat in the front seat of my dad's truck

153
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
and I was the navigator.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
We had never driven across country before,

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,560
I mean, what a trip.

156
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
And I remember the very first day,

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,580
we were gonna stop in a town in Pennsylvania

158
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,520
to visit with my aunt and uncle.

159
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
And we were gonna stop there and visit with them.

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
And I'm gonna tell you, my dad,

161
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,520
we had two vehicles going,

162
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,020
my dad and I were in the pickup truck

163
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,520
and my mom and brother were in the minivan behind

164
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,960
and we drove around that little town about seven times.

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,340
And we just kept driving around and around and around

166
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,480
because my dad knew where we were going.

167
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
He knew where we were going.

168
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
And I'm like, dad, I'm pretty sure

169
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,260
we crossed these railroad tracks like six times already.

170
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm pretty sure that's the same convenience store

171
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,080
that we passed.

172
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm pretty sure we've been here.

173
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Finally, my dad pulls into a little convenience store

174
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,760
and guess what he does?

175
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,660
He asks for directions.

176
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,480
But before he asked for directions,

177
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
he had to recognize that there was a deficiency,

178
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,420
he didn't know where he was going.

179
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,000
And he had to ask for direction.

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
Here in our text of scripture,

181
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,000
Manoah, because he recognized his deficiency,

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
he makes a request.

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,960
And the request is a request for direction.

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
Can I submit to you this morning

185
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,520
that whether you're a father, whether you're a mother,

186
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,240
whether you're a husband, a wife, a child,

187
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,720
a single individual, whoever you are,

188
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,840
whatever your stage is in life,

189
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,080
whatever your position is in life,

190
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,540
you need God's direction.

191
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,020
You absolutely need God's direction.

192
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,120
You can't navigate life on your own.

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,240
You can try.

194
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
You're gonna find that you're gonna take

195
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,600
a lot of wrong turns, a lot of troubled paths.

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,120
The Bible tells us that the steps of a good man

197
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,240
are ordered by the Lord.

198
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,640
The Bible tells us that God will lead us in a plain path.

199
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,320
He'll make the directions, he'll provide us with a way.

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
The Bible tells us that we're to trust in the Lord

201
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
with all of our hearts,

202
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
that we're not to lean on our own understanding,

203
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,120
but we're to acknowledge him.

204
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,440
He says that he will direct our paths.

205
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,000
This morning, I don't care what your stage of life,

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,080
what your arena of life is today,

207
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,560
you need God's direction.

208
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Manoah recognized that he needed direction.

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,680
He makes that request, why?

210
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,840
Because he's never been a father before,

211
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,400
because he never had children.

212
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,960
He didn't know what to do, how to do,

213
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,880
and because he recognized his deficiency,

214
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,120
he made this request for direction.

215
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
We read it already in verse number eight,

216
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,800
but notice, the Bible tells us,

217
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,000
then Manoah entreated the Lord.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
And notice what he says,

219
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,360
oh my Lord, let the men of God which thou did send.

220
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,600
Now we'll get to this in just a moment in our final point,

221
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,700
where we spend most of our time this morning.

222
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,600
We find that Manoah's wife received the announcement

223
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
before Manoah did.

224
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,560
Manoah's wife shares that information with Manoah,

225
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,120
so then Manoah says, send again.

226
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,960
It says, oh my Lord, let the man of God

227
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,220
which thou did send come again unto us.

228
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,900
For what purpose?

229
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,880
To teach us what we shall do

230
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,320
unto the child that shall be born.

231
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
Very interesting, there's a measure of faith

232
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,040
with regard to the announcement that was made

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,400
when the angel of the Lord appeared there to Manoah's wife,

234
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
and it says, thou shalt conceive and bear a son.

235
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,280
Now Manoah, as he received that communication from his wife,

236
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
he says, teach us what we shall do

237
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,400
unto the child that shall be born.

238
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,200
He expected that the child would be born,

239
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,180
but he made a request for direction.

240
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,560
We read in verse number 12,

241
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,280
where the Bible says that Manoah said,

242
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,980
now let thy words come to pass.

243
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,260
How shall we order the child,

244
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,160
and how shall we do unto him?

245
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,180
I've often said that God is the creator.

246
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,980
He is the one that gave life, amen?

247
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,980
He is the one that has ordained the relationships in life.

248
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,340
He is the one that has instituted marriage.

249
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,080
He is the one that instituted the home.

250
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,060
He is the one that instituted the church.

251
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
He is the one that instituted government.

252
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,740
He is the creator.

253
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,820
He is the sustainer, but he's also the instructor.

254
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,020
In each of those arenas in life,

255
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,340
we find that God, he did not just institute marriage

256
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,580
and not provide any direction for marriage.

257
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,500
He did not institute the home

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,660
and not provide any instruction for the home.

259
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,380
No, we find that what God instituted,

260
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,420
God also gave instruction for.

261
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,060
As we've studied through the book of 1 Timothy

262
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,760
here on Sunday mornings,

263
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,400
we have discovered throughout that book

264
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,340
that God instituted the church,

265
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,320
that Christ is the head of the church,

266
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,720
but there's so much instruction for the church.

267
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,400
How do we behave as God's people?

268
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,760
How do we function?

269
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,120
How do we operate as a church?

270
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,000
And it's important for us to understand

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,160
and to take that information, that instruction,

272
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
and to apply it.

273
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,720
The same is true in the home.

274
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,040
The same is true in your family.

275
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,720
The same is true in your life.

276
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,280
How do I order my steps?

277
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
How do I know what to do?

278
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,320
How do I know what pleases God?

279
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,840
How do I know what displeases God?

280
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,400
You better get into this book.

281
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,120
Many people, unfortunately, are trying to live life,

282
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,320
even, sadly, some of the people that profess

283
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,160
to know Christ as their savior

284
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,560
are trying to live life apart from the instruction

285
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,280
that God has provided.

286
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,600
They might read other books on parenting.

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,480
They might read other books on how to be a good husband

288
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
or a good wife or how to be a better me

289
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,680
or whatever the book might be that you wanna read.

290
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,240
But the reality is that God has given us

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,520
valuable instruction in this precious book.

292
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,680
And we find that here, that Manoah,

293
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,200
he makes this request, what do we do?

294
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,360
How do we do?

295
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,320
We don't know what to do.

296
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,560
His request reveals to us his deficiency.

297
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,080
Look over the book of James, if you will.

298
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,680
Hold your spot there in Judges.

299
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
We'll be back in just a moment.

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,760
But I want you to see in James in chapter number one.

301
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,080
It's a verse of scripture that we could quote,

302
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,040
many of us, I could quote it for you this morning,

303
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,560
but I want you to look at it.

304
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,400
Why?

305
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Because I want you to see it.

306
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
I want you to underline something in this text of scripture

307
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,040
in James chapter number one and verse number five.

308
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,720
It's a familiar verse of scripture.

309
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,940
Again, many of us could quote at least a portion

310
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,940
of this verse of scripture this morning.

311
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,180
But the Bible says this, if any of you,

312
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,860
I like the way that it says that

313
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,640
because really that's inclusive, amen?

314
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,860
If any of you lack wisdom,

315
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,820
let him ask of God.

316
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,340
Now who is God?

317
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,020
Well, God is the creator, he's the sustainer.

318
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,300
We also understand this when we understand who God is,

319
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,140
that he has revealed himself to us

320
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,340
as being the all wise God.

321
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,380
We often use the theological term that he is omniscient,

322
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,860
that he knows all things.

323
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,100
He has all wisdom.

324
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,980
I'm thankful that he has all power.

325
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm thankful that he's everywhere present,

326
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,820
but I'm thankful this morning that our God,

327
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,820
my God, my father, he has all wisdom.

328
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,940
And he says to me, and he says to you as his children,

329
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,660
if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,

330
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,619
notice what it says, that giveth, giveth what?

331
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,380
Well, giveth wisdom to all men liberally

332
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,420
and upbraideth not, and then notice this,

333
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,540
and it shall be given him.

334
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Now here's an important truth

335
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,700
with regard to this text of scripture.

336
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,820
It ends with a great promise.

337
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,980
It shall be given him.

338
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,460
To who?

339
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,340
To the one who asks.

340
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,179
To the one who asks.

341
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,059
Who's the one that's gonna ask?

342
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,020
The one that recognizes that they lack, amen?

343
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,619
If any of you lack, see that's really, in my opinion,

344
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,580
the key to this verse of scripture,

345
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,179
if any of you lack wisdom.

346
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,739
So often we go through life never acknowledging,

347
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:29,739
never recognizing that we lack wisdom,

348
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:32,220
therefore we never ask for wisdom,

349
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,220
therefore we never get wisdom.

350
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,900
If God has made us a promise, and by the way,

351
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,660
does God fulfill his promises?

352
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,300
All of his promises, we can be sure of.

353
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,420
They are yea in him, and we can rejoice in that,

354
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,380
and we can understand.

355
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,540
We sing about standing on his promises

356
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,940
and claiming the promises, and we ought to,

357
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,059
but the reality this morning is that this great promise

358
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,940
in James one and verse number five,

359
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,300
so often is not fulfilled.

360
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,020
filled in your life or my life because I don't ask.

361
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,100
Because you don't ask.

362
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,620
Why don't we ask?

363
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,900
Because we don't recognize that we need it.

364
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,620
We think we can handle it.

365
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,560
Then all of a sudden, something big comes in your life.

366
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,740
And you say, oh man, this one right here,

367
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,820
like I need wisdom on this one.

368
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,300
I'm gonna go seek God because,

369
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,260
can I submit to you this morning

370
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,780
that you need God's wisdom every day of your life?

371
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,580
It's not just for the quote unquote big things.

372
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,740
For every day of your life, you need God's wisdom.

373
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,300
You need to live dependent upon him.

374
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,940
And so we find in our text of scripture in Judges 13

375
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,700
that there's a recognition of deficiency

376
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,320
which leads to a request for direction,

377
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,260
which leads to, as we go back to Judges 13,

378
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,100
and really the primary focus of our message this morning,

379
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,140
there is a robust directive.

380
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,220
I'm thankful that God answers the prayer,

381
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,460
the request that is given of Manoah

382
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,180
here in Judges 13.

383
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,540
He asks the question, he makes the request,

384
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,780
teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

385
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,260
How shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him?

386
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,500
And we see the request is made,

387
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,340
but we can rejoice this morning

388
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,180
that there is a robust directive that is given.

389
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
God does not simply say to us,

390
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,380
hey, do your best, good luck, figure it out.

391
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,780
No, he gives us direction.

392
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,440
He provides directives.

393
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,700
Have you ever been assigned to do a task

394
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,660
and not instructed on how to do it?

395
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,580
It's frustrating.

396
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,060
It's frustrating.

397
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,560
You say, how do I do this?

398
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,180
And maybe a foreman, a boss, someone else says,

399
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,340
figure it out.

400
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,900
Okay.

401
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
And then you figure it out.

402
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,980
And you did it wrong.

403
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,380
And they say, that's not how you're supposed to do it.

404
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,260
Well, I asked you how I was supposed to do it

405
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,660
and you didn't tell me.

406
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,760
It can be frustrating.

407
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,180
See, here in our text of Scripture,

408
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,540
God graciously provides direction

409
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,740
because Manoah requested direction.

410
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,620
Notice with me in verse number 23,

411
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,180
Manoah makes the statement in verse 22,

412
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,540
Manoah said unto his wife,

413
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,620
we shall surely die because we have seen God.

414
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,020
But his wife said unto him,

415
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,140
if the Lord were pleased to kill us,

416
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,180
he would not have received a burnt offering

417
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,140
and a meat offering at our hands.

418
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,720
Neither would he have showed us all these things,

419
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,180
nor would as it at this time

420
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,900
have told us such things as these.

421
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,140
I want you to notice two statements

422
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
at the end of verse number 23.

423
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Manoah's wife said that he showed us all these things.

424
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,100
And then we see that it says also,

425
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,180
told us such things as these.

426
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,140
The directive is given contextually

427
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,060
in our text of Scripture.

428
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,500
If you turn back to the beginning of the chapter,

429
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
we read through verse three by way of introduction.

430
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,180
Pick it up in verse number four.

431
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,660
We find that the announcement is made

432
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
at the end of verse number three,

433
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,580
that thou shalt conceive and bear a son.

434
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,240
In verse number four, this is the initial instruction

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,660
that is given to Manoah's wife.

436
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,180
It says in verse number four,

437
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,260
now therefore beware, I pray thee,

438
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,860
and drink not wine nor strong drink,

439
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,020
and eat not any unclean thing.

440
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,980
For lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son,

441
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,220
and no razor shall come on his head.

442
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,160
For this child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb,

443
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,220
and he shall begin to deliver Israel

444
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,000
out of the hand of the Philistines.

445
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,340
We find the Bible says that the woman came

446
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,900
and told her husband, saying,

447
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,420
notice what she says in verse number six,

448
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,220
the man of God came unto me,

449
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,540
and his countenance was like the countenance

450
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,580
of an angel of God, very terrible.

451
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,340
But I asked him not whence he was,

452
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,060
neither told he me his name.

453
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,180
But he said unto me, notice now in verse number seven,

454
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,360
Manoah's wife is going to share this announcement

455
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,240
with Manoah.

456
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,460
It says in verse number seven,

457
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,460
but he said unto me, behold, thou shalt conceive

458
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,200
and bear a son, and now drink no wine nor strong drink,

459
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,040
neither eat any unclean thing,

460
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,440
for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb

461
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,260
to the day of his death.

462
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,320
Then Manoah, after hearing this news,

463
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,000
we've read verse eight a couple of times,

464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,840
but after hearing the news from his wife,

465
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,200
he cries out, he says, he intrudeth the Lord,

466
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,720
and said, O my Lord, let the man of God,

467
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,000
which thou didst send, come again unto us,

468
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,520
and teach us what we shall do unto the child

469
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
that shall be born.

470
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,880
And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah,

471
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,920
and the angel of God came again unto the woman

472
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,720
as she sat in the field.

473
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,420
But notice Manoah, her husband was not with her.

474
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,320
So what does she do?

475
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,840
The woman made haste and ran,

476
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
and showed her husband, and said unto him,

477
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
behold, the man hath appeared unto me

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,160
that came unto me the other day.

479
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,240
Manoah rose and went after his wife,

480
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
and came to the man, and said unto him,

481
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
art thou the man that spakest unto the woman?

482
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And he said, I am.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,200
And Manoah said, now let thy words come to pass.

484
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,540
How shall we order the child,

485
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,880
and how shall we do unto him?

486
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
In verse number 13 and 14,

487
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,240
now the angel of the Lord is gonna speak to Manoah,

488
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
and give this instruction,

489
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,720
this robust directive that we see.

490
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,480
Says the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah,

491
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,120
of all that I said unto the woman, let her beware.

492
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,640
She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine,

493
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,040
neither let her drink wine or strong drink,

494
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,360
nor eat any unclean thing.

495
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,120
All that I have commanded her, let her observe.

496
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,920
In verse 15, the Bible says that Manoah said unto

497
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
the angel of the Lord, I pray thee,

498
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,440
let us detain thee until we shall have made ready

499
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,640
a kid for thee.

500
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,880
The angel of the Lord said unto Manoah,

501
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,120
though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread.

502
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
And if thou will offer a burnt offering,

503
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,560
thou must offer it unto the Lord.

504
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,280
For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.

505
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,720
And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord,

506
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,280
what is thy name?

507
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,000
That when thy sayings come to pass,

508
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
we may do thee honor.

509
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,600
And the angel of the Lord said unto him,

510
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,920
why askest thou thus after my name,

511
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,680
seeing it a secret?

512
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,600
So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering

513
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,440
and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord.

514
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,800
And the angel did wondrously,

515
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,440
and Manoah and his wife looked on,

516
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,480
for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven

517
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,400
from off the altar that the angel of the Lord

518
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
ascended to the flame of the altar.

519
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,680
Manoah and his wife looked on it

520
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,000
and fell on their faces to the ground.

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah

522
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
and to his wife than Manoah knew

523
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,640
that he was an angel of the Lord.

524
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
And here's where he says that they'll die.

525
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,160
In verse 22, Manoah said unto his wife,

526
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,680
we shall surely die because we have seen God.

527
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,660
But his wife said unto him,

528
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,680
if the Lord were pleased to kill us,

529
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,440
he would not have received a burnt offering

530
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,640
and a meat offering at our hands.

531
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,040
Neither would he have showed us all these things,

532
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,440
nor would as at this time have told us

533
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,600
such things as these.

534
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,640
And notice verse 24,

535
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,840
and the woman bare a son and called his name Samson.

536
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,440
And the child grew and the Lord blessed him.

537
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,360
And the spirit of the Lord began to move him at times

538
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,840
in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtol.

539
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,240
As we look at this text of scripture,

540
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
we see again contextually the answer to the question,

541
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
the request that's made for direction

542
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
that God provides the directive.

543
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,440
He had already provided to Manoah's wife

544
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,620
in verses four and five,

545
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,680
and then his wife faithfully communicated to him

546
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
in verse number seven.

547
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,320
But then at the request of Manoah

548
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
in verses 13 and 14,

549
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,760
the angel of the Lord came and delivered this message

550
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,400
to Manoah to give an answer to the question.

551
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,240
I submit to you this morning that as we consider

552
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,180
this as being Father's Day,

553
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,120
that as fathers that we are to bring our children up

554
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,300
in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord,

555
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,760
that we have a responsibility to seek the face of God,

556
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,480
to understand even as here Manoah says,

557
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,440
how shall we order the child?

558
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,200
Lord, teach us what we shall do unto the child

559
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
that shall be born.

560
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,560
This morning, each of us need God's direction,

561
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,400
but just for a few moments and by way of closing,

562
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
let me share some truth with you

563
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,700
with regard to taking an application

564
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,240
from this text of scripture for fathers

565
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,720
on how we are to order, how we are to teach,

566
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,980
how we're to train, how we're to raise our children.

567
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,700
Turn back to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will.

568
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,740
In the sixth chapter, Deuteronomy chapter number six,

569
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,060
beginning in verse number one,

570
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,500
it's a familiar passage of scripture.

571
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,060
As we look at this passage of scripture,

572
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,920
we find that God had provided Israel with instruction

573
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,300
with regard to the home life and the responsibility

574
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,500
to teach and to train the children that would be born.

575
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,260
In verse number one in Deuteronomy six,

576
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,460
the Bible says now these are the commandments,

577
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,580
the statutes and the judgments

578
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,220
which the Lord your God commanded to teach you.

579
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,140
Notice this phrase that ye might do them

580
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,300
in the land whither you go to possess it.

581
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
God did not give the commands

582
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,780
so that we could just know them,

583
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,900
but he gave the commands

584
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,820
so that we would apply them and do them.

585
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,980
We find that in verse number two,

586
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,500
it says that thou mightest fear the Lord thy God

587
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,700
to keep all his statutes and his commandments

588
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,940
which I command thee,

589
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,880
thou and thy son and thy son's son,

590
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,980
all the days of thy life

591
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,260
and that thy days may be prolonged.

592
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,020
Now we understand as we look through Israel's history,

593
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,080
there are many times even as we found

594
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,300
there in our text of scripture in Judges 13

595
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,500
where they were not obedient

596
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,860
to the commands that God had given.

597
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,820
In fact, they were evil, they were wicked,

598
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
they did wickedly in the sight of God

599
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,260
and therefore judgment came

600
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,660
as we started the 13th chapter of the book of Judges,

601
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,700
it was the Philistines that brought great persecution,

602
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,500
if you will, to the children of Israel.

603
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,740
Israel for 40 years according to that text of scripture.

604
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,700
In verse three it says,

605
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,020
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it.

606
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,620
You see again a focus on doing,

607
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,300
that it may be well with thee,

608
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,820
and that ye may increase mightily

609
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,100
as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee

610
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,260
in the land that floweth with milk and honey.

611
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,100
Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,

612
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,180
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God

613
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,260
with all thine heart, with all thy soul,

614
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,780
and with all thy might.

615
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,940
And these words which I command thee this day

616
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,500
shall be in thine heart.

617
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,400
By the way, if it's not really in your heart,

618
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,340
your kids know it.

619
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,100
If it's not really in your heart,

620
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,060
the people you're trying to minister to,

621
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,140
the people you're trying to influence,

622
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,380
to reach, to teach, they know it.

623
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,380
They know it if it's not really in your heart.

624
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,020
See, the command first in Deuteronomy chapter number six

625
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,420
is to the individual, the importance that we receive,

626
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,020
that we do, that it's in our hearts.

627
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,580
And then we find in verse number seven,

628
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,460
and thou shalt teach them.

629
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,340
Teach them how?

630
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,700
Teach them diligently unto thy children,

631
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,460
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,

632
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,220
and when thou walkest by the way,

633
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,740
and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up,

634
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,740
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,

635
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,220
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes,

636
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,860
and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house

637
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,060
and on thy gates.

638
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,300
Listen, the idea in verses six, eight, and nine

639
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,980
is not so that it would just be for outward show.

640
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,540
It's not something that we just have these phylacteries.

641
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,420
By the way, the Jewish people were guilty of that.

642
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,060
They still are guilty of that today.

643
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,860
Many times during the life and ministry

644
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,940
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

645
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,820
he'd say to some of the religious leaders,

646
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,100
you don't even know what this means.

647
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,940
What's he talking about?

648
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,500
They'd have scripture written on their person.

649
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,060
They'd have it attached to their robes,

650
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
and they'd have it,

651
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,660
and they didn't even understand what it meant.

652
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,700
The idea is not for outward show,

653
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,340
but it's to be that continual reminder

654
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,940
of what the Lord has said

655
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,820
so that we would apply the truth in our lives,

656
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,340
and we find that here in this text of scripture

657
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,060
that God says, first of all,

658
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,500
before you're ever going to effectively

659
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,780
teach your children, you must be doing it yourself.

660
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,660
Can I tell you this morning

661
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,340
that if we can step back from the role

662
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,180
and the attention on fathers here this morning,

663
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,300
and we just say, in whatever place you have of ministry,

664
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,340
whatever opportunity God would give you

665
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,020
to influence someone,

666
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,700
can I tell you that you must be doing

667
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
before you start teaching?

668
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,860
You don't want to be accused and guilty of hypocrisy.

669
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,540
Hypocrisy.

670
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,820
The leaven of the Pharisees.

671
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,460
Hypocrisy.

672
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,740
They weren't doing.

673
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,300
They weren't doing.

674
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,020
And this morning, we find that there's an emphasis

675
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,860
that's placed here, and after we have received,

676
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,380
and after we're doing,

677
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,540
then we're to teach diligently to our children

678
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,220
or to whomever it is that we have influence over.

679
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,180
And by the way, I believe this morning

680
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,900
that every one of us has some sphere of influence.

681
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,500
Can I tell you this morning,

682
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
and I'm not picking on anyone in particular,

683
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,940
I'll use my own children as an example

684
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,020
that are here this morning,

685
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
but can I tell you that there's some young boys

686
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,140
in our church that look up to Joseph?

687
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,580
They do.

688
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,020
There's some young ladies in our church

689
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,740
that look up to Brianna.

690
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,660
They have an opportunity to influence

691
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,060
some of the younger kids in our church

692
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,700
that you and I might not have the same opportunity

693
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,500
to influence.

694
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,580
All of us have a sphere of influence.

695
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,980
It doesn't have, well, I'm not a father,

696
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,300
I'm gonna shut this message down.

697
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,700
No, no, no, be careful.

698
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,860
Because each of us have a sphere of influence.

699
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,620
There's somebody that's watching you.

700
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,780
I'm gonna preach on that tonight.

701
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,140
I hope you'll come back.

702
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,060
The reality is that we find that God gives this,

703
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,660
yes, he answers the prayer, the request of Manoah,

704
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,020
but I want you to understand that biblically,

705
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,420
as we consider in our own lives,

706
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,180
and I make the appeal to you this morning,

707
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,820
listen, you must recognize your deficiency.

708
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,340
You must make a request for direction.

709
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,940
And then you find that God has given a robust directive.

710
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,220
He has given truth in his word.

711
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,740
And as we seek him, as we understand that we lack wisdom

712
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,340
and we've asked God for wisdom,

713
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,780
he takes us to his word and his Holy Spirit

714
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
that indwells us is our teacher

715
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,660
and he teaches us his word.

716
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,740
And he helps us to be able to have that influence

717
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,020
and to be able to give the truth

718
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,620
that we're commanded to give.

719
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,180
Turn to the book of Proverbs, if you will,

720
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,460
in the fourth chapter.

721
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,040
Proverbs chapter number four.

722
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,100
We're gonna look at the first few verses

723
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,780
of this text of scripture in the fourth proverb.

724
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,940
We find that here, of course,

725
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,900
we understand that the book of Proverbs

726
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,860
from a human perspective is Solomon

727
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,540
writing to his son, Rehoboam.

728
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,820
And we find that as this text of scripture in chapter four,

729
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,580
it's really a generational text.

730
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,860
It says, hear ye children the instruction of a father

731
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,820
and attend to no understanding.

732
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,500
Beyond it being just the human relationship

733
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,400
of Solomon teaching Rehoboam,

734
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,180
we understand that spiritually it is God, our father,

735
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,260
who's giving us direction and instruction.

736
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,580
We find it in verse number two,

737
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,900
it says, for I give you good doctrine,

738
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,980
forsake ye not my law.

739
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,500
For I, Solomon speaking, was my father's son,

740
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,060
tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

741
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,020
Who's his father?

742
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,300
David, of course.

743
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,600
And it says in verse number four,

744
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,440
it says he taught me also.

745
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,460
So David gave some instruction to Solomon.

746
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,820
By the way, at the end of David's life,

747
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,100
you can read it in both 2 Samuel and 1 Kings,

748
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,700
you can read the instruction that is given

749
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,460
from David to Solomon.

750
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,340
We find that David makes this,

751
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,980
excuse me, Solomon makes this statement

752
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,980
that he taught me also.

753
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
It says, and said unto me,

754
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,700
let thine heart retain my words.

755
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,940
Keep my commandments and live.

756
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,900
Get wisdom.

757
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,540
Where do we get wisdom from?

758
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,980
From God.

759
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,620
Get wisdom, get understanding.

760
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,140
Forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.

761
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,900
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee.

762
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,460
Love her, and she shall keep thee.

763
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,500
That's wisdom.

764
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,980
Verse seven, wisdom is the principal thing.

765
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,340
Therefore, get wisdom, and with all thy getting,

766
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,380
get understanding.

767
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,300
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee.

768
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,560
She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her.

769
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,260
So shall give, she shall give to thine head

770
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
an ornament of grace, a crown of glory.

771
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Shall she deliver to thee.

772
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,100
Notice verse 10.

773
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,860
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings.

774
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,700
Can I pause there just for a moment?

775
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,260
There's a difference between hearing and receiving.

776
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,380
There's a difference between hearing and receiving.

777
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,580
You can hear me this morning,

778
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,060
but you don't have to receive anything I'm saying.

779
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,300
You can hear your parents, you don't have to receive.

780
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,820
You can hear from God,

781
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,900
but he's not gonna make you receive it.

782
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,300
Isn't that a scary thought?

783
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,180
He loves you so much that he gives you truth.

784
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,780
He gave us a Bible.

785
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,020
He gave you a preacher here this morning

786
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,900
to preach the Bible,

787
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,020
but he's not gonna make you receive it.

788
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,260
There's a difference between hearing and receiving.

789
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,500
You ever had somebody, are you hearing me?

790
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,980
Are you listening to me?

791
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,580
They make a distinction between hearing and listening.

792
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,660
You ever have somebody, you're giving them instruction,

793
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,780
maybe a little child, and they're hearing.

794
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,060
It's not that they're deaf.

795
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,580
They can hear you.

796
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,300
They're just not listening to you.

797
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,820
Hearing and receiving.

798
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:51,820
He says, hear, O my son, and receive my sayings.

799
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,900
The years of thy life shall be many.

800
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,380
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom.

801
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,100
I have led thee in right paths.

802
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,380
I wonder this morning if we could say

803
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,580
that I have taught thee in the way of wisdom.

804
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,140
I have led thee in right paths.

805
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,180
I hope that we could.

806
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,060
Whether you have children or not,

807
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,420
to the people that you're influencing,

808
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,300
I wonder could we make that statement,

809
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,020
could we say that this morning,

810
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,060
that I have fulfilled my responsibility.

811
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,740
I have given the truth.

812
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,620
I have no control over how you receive it

813
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,940
or what you do with it,

814
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,700
but I do have a responsibility to give it.

815
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,380
Proverbs 22, a familiar verse of Scripture,

816
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,980
in verse number six, the Bible says this.

817
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
I believe it's one of my dad's favorite verses of Scripture.

818
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,540
The Bible says in verse number six of Proverbs 22,

819
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,540
train up a child in the way he should go.

820
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,260
When he is old, he will not depart from it.

821
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,300
Can I tell you this morning,

822
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,860
there's this philosophy that's seeking

823
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,220
to influence our culture that says something like this,

824
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,900
just let your kids figure it out.

825
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,220
Can I tell you that God said train them?

826
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,820
He didn't give you this hands-off approach of,

827
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,620
look, they're gonna just figure out life on their own.

828
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,820
No, you've been given a God-given responsibility

829
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,820
to train them.

830
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,660
Can I tell you that training requires more than telling?

831
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,900
Telling them is not training them.

832
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,940
Training them takes work, takes commitment, dedication.

833
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,540
It takes sweat, blood, tears to train someone.

834
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,820
Here in the text, train up a child,

835
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,900
notice, in the way he should go.

836
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,940
Teaching them the ways of the Lord,

837
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,020
teaching them what thus saith the Lord,

838
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,020
teaching them what pleases God and what displeases God.

839
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,380
By the way, what you do not know, you cannot teach.

840
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,540
What you do not know,

841
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,100
No, you cannot teach.

842
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,240
If someone came in here and said,

843
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,500
Pastor, can you teach me?

844
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,100
And they named some language.

845
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,180
I don't know any other language.

846
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,680
I don't even know English real good.

847
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,980
But you understand, if you don't know it,

848
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,440
you can't teach it.

849
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
So you better have a close walk with God.

850
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,820
That's why in Deuteronomy 6,

851
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,620
it starts with the individual

852
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,660
receiving and doing and having in your heart,

853
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,800
because then you can begin to teach.

854
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,240
To train up the involvement that is required.

855
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,500
We cannot, we can no longer think

856
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
that training our children

857
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,380
is the responsibility of the school.

858
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,080
What a tragic situation that would be.

859
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Can I also say to you

860
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,480
that it's not the responsibility of the church?

861
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,620
It's not the church's responsibility

862
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,280
to train your children.

863
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,560
Now, I will say this,

864
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,360
the church should come alongside of you

865
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,260
and help you in the process of training your children.

866
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,060
But the church has not been given the responsibility.

867
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,960
The parents have been given the responsibility.

868
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,460
Ephesians chapter number six,

869
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,360
the verse of scripture that's there

870
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,300
on your bulletin this morning

871
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,200
that we quoted by way of introduction,

872
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,700
and ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,

873
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,940
but bring them up in the nurture

874
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,040
and admonition of the Lord.

875
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,800
This admonition, this command to bring them up.

876
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,100
Listen, your kids, the young people in our church,

877
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,500
they need direction.

878
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,540
Can I tell you this morning,

879
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,740
there is a world out there

880
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,380
that is standing by waiting

881
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,520
to give your kids all kinds of direction.

882
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,680
And I would submit to you

883
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,020
that most of that direction

884
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,780
that they want to give your children

885
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,980
is in direct opposition to the instruction

886
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,420
that's given in this precious book.

887
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,000
But they're waiting to do it.

888
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,140
Oh, there are people online

889
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,580
that are waiting to instruct your children.

890
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,940
There are people that are ready,

891
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,020
they're ready to give false teaching,

892
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,860
false instruction, false worldviews.

893
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,100
Wouldn't have a biblical worldview.

894
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,120
Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,

895
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,980
the involvement that is required.

896
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,060
There's a great connection between Proverbs 22

897
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,660
in verse six and Ephesians six and verse number four.

898
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,260
As we look at the passage of scripture this morning

899
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,860
from Judges, and we look in the chapter

900
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,420
and the situation there between Manoah and his wife

901
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,780
and receiving this announcement in Judges 13

902
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,780
with regard to the fact that though they had no children,

903
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,660
that they would soon have a child.

904
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,220
There's a recognition on the part of Manoah

905
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,020
of his own deficiencies.

906
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,620
I don't know what I'm doing.

907
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,380
Do you ever feel like that in life?

908
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,220
You say, I don't want to admit it.

909
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,180
I know, because we have a hard time admitting it.

910
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,420
There are times in lives, listen,

911
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,220
there's some times that God will bring you to a place

912
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,700
that he'll bring you to the end of yourself

913
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,940
so that you recognize you need him

914
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,380
and you can no longer do it.

915
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,980
You should no longer desire to do it

916
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,980
in your own power and your own strength.

917
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,140
Manoah recognized his deficiencies.

918
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,340
He recognized and therefore he made a request.

919
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,260
I wonder this morning, how often do we request of God

920
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,020
to provide us with direction in our lives?

921
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,020
Yes, within the context of this message this morning,

922
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,700
specifically to fathers on training their children

923
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,980
and bringing them up in the nurturing

924
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,300
and the admonition of the Lord

925
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,160
and running to the word of God to receive the directive

926
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,620
that God has provided us with, absolutely.

927
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,780
But what about where you are in your life?

928
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,780
Regardless of who you are,

929
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,160
with regard to your responsibilities,

930
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,160
your position in life, you need God's direction.

931
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,380
I said this on Wednesday evening

932
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,540
to end our missions conference.

933
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,340
I said this, there was a great emphasis

934
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,500
throughout the conference,

935
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,680
but especially there on Wednesday evening, of surrender.

936
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,680
And I said this, surrender can be a fearful thing.

937
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,600
But surrender is the most freeing thing

938
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,520
when we're surrendering to God.

939
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,600
When we, listen, I don't want people to think I don't,

940
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,600
listen, God knows your deficiencies.

941
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,640
He knows my deficiencies.

942
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,200
It's best for us to acknowledge them

943
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,120
and seek him for direction.

944
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,260
There are times in my life

945
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,000
that I'll say something like this when I pray.

946
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,120
God, I have no idea what I'm doing.

947
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,600
I have no idea what needs to be done.

948
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,720
I have no idea what the next step should be.

949
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,320
God, I need your direction.

950
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,020
God, you promised in your word

951
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,160
that you would give me direction.

952
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,680
Can I tell you this morning,

953
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,500
I've prayed that prayer in the context of parenting.

954
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,640
I've prayed that prayer in the context of pastoring.

955
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,920
I've prayed that prayer in the context

956
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,720
of just being a Christian.

957
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,040
God, I need your help.

958
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,720
I'm thankful that he's a very present help

959
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,560
at the time of trouble, that he will give us what we need.

960
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,480
And he said, he promises to you,

961
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,800
he promises to me that he will give us wisdom,

962
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,500
that he'll give us the direction.

963
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,640
But the person that receives the direction,

964
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,200
the wisdom is the one who asks.

965
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,080
The one who asks is the one that recognizes

966
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,820
that they lack and they need it.

967
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,200
This morning, we see a great example

968
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,720
in the life of Manoah in Judges 13,

969
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,160
an example that is applicable to every one of our lives,

970
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,260
how desperately we need God

971
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,620
to provide direction in our lives.

972
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,460
Let's pray together.

973
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,520
Father, we love you.

974
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,120
We thank you for loving us.

975
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,960
We thank you for the opportunity

976
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,040
that you've given us to gather today.

977
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,360
We thank you, God, for the freedom that we have

978
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,040
in this nation that we can openly worship thee.

979
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,600
I pray, Father, that you would work in hearts and lives.

980
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,480
If there's one here this morning that's not saved,

981
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
God, I pray that they would understand

982
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,880
how much you love them.

983
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,240
That you sent your only begotten son,

984
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,320
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

985
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,280
to come to this sin-cursed world to die

986
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,220
on a cruel cross to take their place,

987
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,620
to pay their sin debt,

988
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,620
was buried and rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave,

989
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,180
alive forevermore, soon to return.

990
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,900
God, I pray that the individual that's not trusted you,

991
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,420
that today, before they leave,

992
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,980
they would trust Christ as their Savior.

993
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,540
They could leave here knowing that heaven is their home,

994
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,180
that, God, you are their Father,

995
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,320
that they are your children.

996
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,340
I pray, Father, that you would work in the hearts and lives

997
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,220
of your people this morning,

998
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,300
regardless of our lot in life, where we are in life,

999
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,740
whether we have children or not,

1000
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,100
whether we're even married or not.

1001
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,460
God, we need your direction.

1002
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,460
These young people, from the youngest to the oldest,

1003
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,340
in our midst this morning, we need your guidance.

1004
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,620
We need your direction.

1005
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,100
God, I pray that you'd help us to acknowledge,

1006
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,980
to recognize our deficiencies,

1007
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,660
and to be dependent upon you,

1008
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,780
to refuse to live independently,

1009
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,180
to refuse to try to navigate our own path,

1010
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,420
but, God, that we would rest in thee,

1011
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,300
and that we would trust thee.

1012
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,900
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives

1013
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,580
as only you can.

1014
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,980
We pray that every decision that's made would be sealed,

1015
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,500
and, Lord, that you'd be honored and glorified,

1016
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,900
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1017
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Would you stand with me?

1018
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,840
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1019
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,700
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

1020
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,060
and as she does, the altar's open.

1021
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,340
Maybe this morning you need to come

1022
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,860
and just recognize your deficiencies.

1023
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,540
Wherever you are in life, you have some deficiencies,

1024
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,780
and you need God's help, you need God's direction.

1025
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,380
Maybe it is specifically with regard to parenting,

1026
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,540
to raising the children, whatever it is that God has done.

1027
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,940
However God's spoken to your heart,

1028
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,140
as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
