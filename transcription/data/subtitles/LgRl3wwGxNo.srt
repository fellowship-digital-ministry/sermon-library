1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
We'll be looking at verses 3 through 6 this morning.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,199
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we'll see the first use of one of the words

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:13,800
that I mentioned several weeks ago that is a common, frequently used word throughout

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
this book.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,299
In fact, in four times in these four verses of Scripture, the word no is used.

6
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:26,280
And I mentioned, and I'm so thankful that our God wants us to be informed, amen?

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,840
He does not want us to be ignorant.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,360
He doesn't want us to be unlearned.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,599
He wants us to know some things, and as we look at His Word, we know that He's given

10
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:39,240
us truth for the purpose of knowing truth, and I'm thankful that the truth will make

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
us free.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,599
I'm thankful for the power of the truth to sanctify us, to set us apart.

13
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm thankful that God, in His Word, has given us these revealed truths that He desires for

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,599
His people to know.

15
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:58,880
As we look at this particular passage of Scripture here this morning, I would say this.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,439
There's one truth that God wants His children to know that we'll examine this morning, and

17
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,739
that is this, that indeed we are His children.

18
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,480
Let me say it a different way, maybe.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,120
The Lord desires for us to be secure in our salvation.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,279
What a blessing it is to know that we're saved, amen?

21
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,839
And not to have this difficulty of going through life and wondering from day to day, moment

22
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:29,959
by moment, circumstance by circumstance, do I belong to the Lord or not?

23
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,800
Am I saved or am I not?

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,639
And what a terrible way to have to live life, and I'm thankful that my salvation is wholly,

25
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:42,720
completely dependent upon God, amen?

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,080
And as I place my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and His finished work on the

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,000
cross of Calvary, He gave me eternal life.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,519
That is the gift of God.

29
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,440
He said, I know my sheep, they hear my voice, they follow me, I give unto them eternal life,

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,360
and they shall never perish.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,279
Peter says that we are kept by the very power of God, and I'm so thankful for the truth

32
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:12,479
that God has given us in His Word with regard to security.

33
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:18,320
You know, the reality is that mankind, human beings, and God, of course, is the Creator,

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,000
so God knows every detail about us, wouldn't you say that's accurate?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,559
God knows every single detail about us.

36
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,960
In fact, the psalmist says that He knows our frame, He knows that we're but dust.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:38,720
He knows us, and He knows that one difficulty, one area of need for mankind is that of security.

38
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,399
It is a need that is shared amongst mankind is being secure.

39
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:49,600
You think about relationships and being secure in your relationship with your spouse, and

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,919
you think about securities, and certainly we take measures in our lives to provide security,

41
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,360
to give security, but I'm thankful with regard to this subject matter of salvation

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,080
that God, understanding who we are, understanding our frame, knowing that we have this basic

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,080
need of security, that He gives us the truth in His Word that we can be secure in our salvation.

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,080
As we look at this passage of Scripture, we'll mention many things with regard to the security

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,160
that is given, but I want to draw your attention to verse number 6, give you the title, and

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
we'll get going this morning.

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,039
The Bible says this in verse number 6.

48
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,279
We will be looking at verses 3 through 6, but just look at verse 6 with me for a moment.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,960
He that saith he abideth in him, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, he that saith he

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:46,960
abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,919
Our theme for this year is found in verse number 7 of 1 John, chapter number 1.

52
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,000
If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,199
In the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son cleanseth us from all sin, and here in verse number

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,360
6 of chapter 2, we see this subject matter of our walk again being mentioned, and we

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,240
are to walk as He walked.

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Walk as He walked.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
We'll use that as our title for the message this morning.

58
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,279
Walk as He walked.

59
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:24,480
I believe that God gives us in His Word several references throughout the Scriptures of evidences

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,480
of salvation, and I like to refer to them as being birthmarks of the believer.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
And this morning, we will see the first of these birthmarks that are mentioned in the

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,679
book of 1 John, and as we look at this passage of Scripture, we see that really God gives

63
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:45,679
us in verse number 3 what I would refer to as being a litmus test.

64
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,519
It is provided for us in verse number 3.

65
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,640
Notice it says, and hereby we do know that we know Him.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,519
Here's the test.

67
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:58,079
Here it is right here at the end of verse number 3, if we keep His commandments.

68
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,000
If we keep His commandments, what is it that this test reveals?

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,440
Well, it says, and hereby we do know that we know Him.

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,359
And so the test, the litmus test that is given is if we keep His commandments, but what it

71
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:16,559
reveals to us is that we know Him.

72
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,959
It does not say that we know about Him, but it says that we know Him.

73
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,679
There is a great difference in knowing about Him than there is in knowing Him.

74
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,559
Would you not agree?

75
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:31,839
Many of us this morning, there are some famous people that we could list off their names,

76
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,279
and we could ask the question, do you know this individual?

77
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,040
And many of you would say, oh yeah, I know, I know.

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,600
You don't know him or her.

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,399
You may know about him or her, many of those figures that we could mention this morning,

80
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,959
but I'm thankful that as we look at the Word of God and the passage that is before us this

81
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:58,079
morning, the Word of God says, and hereby we do know that we know Him.

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,160
How do we know that we know Him?

83
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
If you keep His commandments.

84
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,959
If we keep His commandments, verse number three.

85
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:14,720
Now understand, no one has ever been and no one will ever be saved by keeping His commandments.

86
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:15,839
Amen?

87
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,320
We're not saved by works.

88
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,000
We understand the Word of God is abundantly clear that we are not saved by our works,

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,559
and so this is not telling us that this is the mode or means by which mankind is saved,

90
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:34,320
for no one's ever been saved and no one will ever be saved by our works,

91
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,359
but He says that here's how we know that we know Him if we keep His commandments.

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,200
As we think about this passage of Scripture this morning,

93
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,920
and we understand the birthmark of the believer that is before us,

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,160
and we consider the litmus test of if we keep His commandments,

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
I want you to notice, if you're taking notes this morning, number one,

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
note the behavior of the possessor.

97
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:06,959
The behavior of the possessor, the one who possesses eternal life,

98
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,399
the one who has trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior,

99
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,239
and we'll look at verses five and six in order to really look at the point.

100
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,559
We'll come back to verse number four here in just a moment,

101
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,279
but notice in verse number five, the Bible is referring to that one who is a possessor.

102
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,000
The Bible says,

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,079
But whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected.

104
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,600
Hereby know we that we are in Him.

105
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,119
Again, we see that word know.

106
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,679
God wants you to know that you're saved. Amen?

107
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,600
He says in verse number three,

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,799
Hereby we do know that we know Him.

109
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,119
In verse number five, He says,

110
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:56,079
Hereby know we that we are in Him.

111
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,320
To be in Christ is a phrase that is used throughout the New Testament.

112
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,519
To be in Christ.

113
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,399
You think about the picture in the Old Testament of Noah in the great flood,

114
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,079
and security was where?

115
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,079
It was in the ark.

116
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,320
It was only those eight that were in the ark that would be spared destruction

117
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,119
through the flood and through God's righteous judgment upon His creation.

118
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:23,279
And we find here that the Bible says that we know Him again in verse number three,

119
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,480
not knowing about Him, but knowing Him.

120
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,760
And then in verse number five,

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,880
Hereby know we that we are in Him.

122
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,080
To be in Christ.

123
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,359
We find here that it is important,

124
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:41,039
and if I could make just a note this morning before we get too far into the passage,

125
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,799
from a language perspective,

126
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,640
a perspective that is given to us here in verses four and five,

127
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,159
it's a principle that is important for us to understand,

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,479
and that is the verb tense of the word keepeth.

129
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,080
In verse number four, you'll see that it says,

130
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not.

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
And then in verse number five, you say,

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
But whoso keepeth his word.

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,919
And so that word keepeth is used in both verses four and five,

134
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,840
and it's the first occasion in the book of 1 John

135
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
where the verb tense is of significant importance.

136
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,039
And we'll see this again as we travel through this book,

137
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,599
especially again in chapter number three,

138
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,159
not getting ahead of myself,

139
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,719
but focusing here on the passage before us.

140
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,760
It is important to understand that this word keepeth,

141
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,520
the verb is conjugated in the present tense,

142
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:38,000
thus indicating an ongoing action.

143
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,799
And it's important for us to understand that

144
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,400
as we'll look at the passage,

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,960
and it will help us to keep in mind

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,799
this note of language principle, if you will,

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,760
with regard to the verb that is used

148
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,679
in the tense of the word keepeth.

149
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,840
And so as we look at this passage,

150
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
I want you to notice in verse number five,

151
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,760
when we think about the behavior of the possessor,

152
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,700
Notice what the Word of God tells us here

153
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,140
in v. 5.

154
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,720
"...but whoso keepeth his word..."

155
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,080
Notice this phrase.

156
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
"...in him..."

157
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
In that individual, in that possessor,

158
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
in the one that's keeping His Word.

159
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,980
Notice it says,

160
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,720
"...in him, verily, truly,

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,520
is the love of God perfected."

162
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,760
When we note the behavior of the possessor,

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,520
we must first look at and acknowledge

164
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,300
the internal work that God is doing.

165
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm so thankful that God's doing a work

166
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,620
on the inside.

167
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,480
Amen?

168
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,080
God is working in the lives of His children.

169
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,600
And you think about the internal work

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,960
of the possessor,

171
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,680
and the Bible describes it in v. 5

172
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,520
that in Him, in this one that is the possessor,

173
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,320
"...in him, verily, truly,

174
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
is the love of God perfected."

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,680
Don't think about the work that God is doing

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
on the inside.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,080
The reality is that I can't see

178
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,520
what God is doing on the inside,

179
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,200
and you can't see what God is doing

180
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
on my inside.

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,520
There is a truth that is given in 1 Samuel 16

182
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,000
with regard to the choosing of David

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,720
to be the king of Israel.

184
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,320
And first, Eliab stands before Samuel.

185
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
And remember, he's the firstborn.

186
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,800
And Samuel immediately has this thought,

187
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,920
surely, he is the one.

188
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Right?

189
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,880
And God says, no.

190
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,840
He's not the one.

191
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't look on his appearance,

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,840
or on his countenance.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,400
He says that God sees the inward.

194
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,720
Man sees the outward,

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
but God sees the inward.

196
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,840
Both the inward and the outward are important

197
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,760
as we'll look at our message this morning

198
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
and acknowledge that truth,

199
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,480
but I want you to consider first of all

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,080
that before there's any external,

201
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,560
there's an internal work that God is doing.

202
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,720
As we trust that the Lord Jesus Christ

203
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
is our Savior,

204
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,600
if you think about the behavior of the possessor,

205
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
if you think about your own life,

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,280
if you are in Christ,

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,000
if you have trust that Christ is your Savior,

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,280
and you begin to look back at your time

209
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,000
of being saved from that moment

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,760
that you trust at Christ until today,

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,880
without regard of how long that has been,

212
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,240
but as you look at your journey with Christ,

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,840
can you not see,

214
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,320
can you not identify and testify this morning

215
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,280
of God's internal work?

216
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,320
His love is perfected, the Bible says.

217
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,800
The love of God is perfected in that one.

218
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,160
Now as you think about the work

219
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,560
that God is doing on the inside,

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,600
no doubt that work is eventually

221
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
gonna be seen on the outside.

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
Is that fair?

223
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Amen?

224
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,320
So there's an internal work that's taking place

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
and God is working.

226
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,440
His love, think about the love of God.

227
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
Nothing can separate us from the love of God.

228
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,080
Aren't you thankful for that?

229
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,680
We sang this morning in Sunday school

230
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,520
a couple of songs,

231
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,800
one of them, Jesus Loves Me, This I Know.

232
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
For the Bible tells me so.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

234
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,080
And His love is perfected in us,

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,160
and as we think about the love of God,

236
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,480
and we think about the work that He's doing in us,

237
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,920
and we think about the internal work,

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
we ought to be grateful for that.

239
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
We ought to rejoice in that.

240
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,960
We ought to invite that work to continue to take place.

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Amen?

242
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,840
God, continue to speak to my heart.

243
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,960
God, continue to work in my life.

244
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,800
God, continue to show me areas in my life

245
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
where I need to change so that I might be more like You,

246
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,840
so that I might please You,

247
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,120
so that I might walk in a manner

248
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,240
in which is honoring and pleasing in Your sight.

249
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,000
God, continue that internal work.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,960
We find not only the internal work of the possessor

251
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,040
or in the possessor,

252
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,600
but I want you to think about the external evidence.

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,480
As I mentioned, that work that is being done on the inside

254
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,880
will eventually be seen on the outside.

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,720
When you think about David in 1 Samuel 16,

256
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
you think about David being anointed in that great truth

257
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,720
that God gives to Samuel in 1 Samuel 16 in verse number seven

258
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,280
with regard to God seeing the heart,

259
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,920
man looking at the outward appearance.

260
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,160
You would find this truth that God says to Samuel

261
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,080
that man looketh on the outward,

262
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,839
but the Lord looketh on the heart.

263
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,040
Remember, God had told Samuel and Samuel told Saul

264
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,960
that God had selected a man that was after his own heart,

265
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,640
but we see the external evidence in the life of David,

266
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,920
for there's a servant that comes to Saul

267
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,360
just a short time later in 1 Samuel 16 in verse number 18,

268
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
and here's how he describes David.

269
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,960
He describes him as being a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite

270
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
that is cunning and playing, a mighty valiant man,

271
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,480
a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person,

272
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,279
and the Lord is with him.

273
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,480
I want you to understand that God saw the heart of David,

274
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,040
but this unnamed servant saw the external evidence

275
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,119
of the work that God had done in David's heart.

276
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,440
As we look at our lives

277
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,640
and we look at this passage of scripture

278
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,240
in 1 John chapter number two,

279
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,480
and we think about the behavior of the possessor,

280
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,240
and yes, that internal work

281
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,960
where truly the love of God is perfected,

282
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,920
we see the external evidence.

283
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,760
Notice in verse number three of 1 John chapter number two,

284
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,119
the Bible says this,

285
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,360
and hereby we do know that we know him,

286
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,920
if we keep his commandments.

287
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000
So in verse number three,

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,520
you see that it's the external evidence

289
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,240
is that we keep his commandments.

290
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,400
In verse number five, what is the external evidence,

291
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,920
but whoso keepeth his word?

292
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,559
I would argue that that's synonymous,

293
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,680
keeping his commandments and keeping his word.

294
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,960
There is a similarity there

295
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
between those two statements that are given,

296
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
the litmus test that is provided

297
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,200
as we mentioned in verse number three,

298
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
and we find that he says that he keeps his commandments,

299
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,080
he keepeth his word,

300
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
and then in verse number six,

301
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,279
notice he talks about abiding in him.

302
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,480
He that saith he abideth in him.

303
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
Does your mind not rush back

304
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,119
to the gospel of John in the 15th chapter

305
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,360
when Jesus and John is there

306
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,800
and Jesus says, abide in me, right?

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,920
He uses that great example,

308
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
that great truth that we see in nature

309
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,600
that the branches cannot sustain their own life,

310
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,440
but the branch is dependent upon the vine, right?

311
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,040
I am the vine, you're the branches.

312
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Is that not what Jesus said in John chapter number 15?

313
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,160
And he says, abide in me,

314
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,880
and now John who walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

315
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,080
who heard the Lord Jesus Christ,

316
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,040
remember he testified in the first chapter of this book

317
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,559
how that he was an eyewitness.

318
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,000
His ears had heard, his eyes had seen,

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,960
his hands have handled of the word of life,

320
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,839
and he speaks about the one that says he abides in him.

321
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,760
Now, it's interesting that in verse three and five,

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,619
there's nothing about saying anything,

323
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,480
it's just the external evidence,

324
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,080
and here in verse number six, he says,

325
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,920
he that saith he abideth in him,

326
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,839
notice what it says,

327
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,839
ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.

328
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
Walk as he walked.

329
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,800
Peter says it this way in 1 Peter chapter number two

330
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,240
and verse number 21,

331
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
that Jesus left us an example

332
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,119
that we should follow his steps.

333
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,160
And as we think about this truth of the external evidence

334
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,839
and the behavior of the possessor,

335
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,360
there's an internal work that is taking place,

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,400
but that internal work is manifested through our behavior,

337
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,440
through the actions that we take,

338
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,200
the external evidence is that this one

339
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,400
that is a possessor

340
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,080
is going to keep the commandments of the Lord,

341
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,520
he keeps the word of God, he walks as he walked.

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,960
The thought of this word keep is that of obedience.

343
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,960
The word literally means to attend to carefully, to observe.

344
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,220
I like the first definition, to attend to carefully.

345
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,119
You know, it's so important

346
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,559
that we carefully examine the word of God

347
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,239
and that we understand what God desires of us.

348
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,720
If we're going to follow the admonition

349
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,640
that Paul gives the believers in Ephesus

350
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,040
that we are to prove what is acceptable

351
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,280
in the sight of the Lord,

352
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,400
to prove what God is pleased with,

353
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,919
we must attend to this book carefully.

354
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,760
And as we give our attention carefully to the word of God,

355
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,239
I'm not just brushing through and skimming over.

356
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:59,479
I don't read this book like I read any other book.

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
There are some, you ever read an article,

358
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
you ever read a book and you kind of just skim through it

359
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,720
and you're like, man, I'm not going to,

360
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
maybe I didn't even finish reading it.

361
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,559
There's some books that I have in my library,

362
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,979
some that I've gotten rid of,

363
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,359
that I started reading and never finished them.

364
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,479
I just didn't feel there was,

365
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,760
it was just not getting anything, right?

366
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
It was just not helpful.

367
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
There's some books in my library that I've read

368
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,799
and I've reread and I've reread

369
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,960
because they've been helpful.

370
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,760
There's some books that I've read once

371
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,320
and I've never read them again.

372
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,520
But this book, this book is not like

373
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,479
any of those other books.

374
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:42,559
This book is a book that I long to deep dive into

375
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,320
and to attend to carefully, why?

376
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,280
Because this book tells me the mind of God.

377
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,359
It tells me the behavior for the saint.

378
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,440
It tells me what is pleasing in His sight.

379
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,200
And as we understand the importance of observing,

380
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,239
of keeping, of attending to carefully His Word,

381
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,080
He says,

382
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,480
is that this one that is a possessor,

383
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
the behavior of the possessor,

384
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,560
yes, there's the internal work that God is doing,

385
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,360
but the external evidence is that

386
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,200
He keeps His commandments,

387
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
He keepeth His Word,

388
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,800
He walks even as Christ walked.

389
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,340
This morning as I've examined

390
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,640
and thought about this passage of Scripture,

391
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
I've considered this idea,

392
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,080
this thought as to why it is

393
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,700
that people would obey.

394
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,040
You know, the reality is that we understand

395
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
the society in which we live,

396
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,200
a society that has been,

397
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,240
and I understand that we have some real problems

398
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
with our judicial system today,

399
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,360
but has been historically set upon laws

400
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,420
and legal precedents.

401
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,840
And laws are important for any society.

402
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,240
Anarchy is bad, amen?

403
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,640
Laws are important.

404
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,700
When we think about obedience

405
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,480
and we think about why it is that we obey,

406
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,160
I would submit to you this morning

407
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
that we as the people of God obey

408
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
for a different reason than some others

409
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,400
may obey other laws and other things.

410
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,680
I think about biblical times

411
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,900
and the writing of the Word of God,

412
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,600
and no doubt there were some

413
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,520
that would serve in capacities

414
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,120
of being servants or slaves,

415
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,320
and they had to obey because it was required.

416
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,580
Obedience was required.

417
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,760
The penalty for disobedience was severe,

418
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,280
often up to including death.

419
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
You think about the severity of that.

420
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
I think about this,

421
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
there are times in which people will obey

422
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,680
because it's necessary.

423
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,280
Slightly different than being required,

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,720
though there's a similar thought there,

425
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,580
but I think about maybe the aspect of an employee.

426
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,300
That they obey the rules, if you will,

427
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,280
the guidelines of the particular company

428
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
in which they work for

429
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,320
out of necessity for this purpose

430
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,780
that it's a duty that I need to keep my job.

431
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,360
And if I'm going to keep my job,

432
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,960
then I'm going to have to obey these guidelines,

433
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,200
these, you guys have an employee handbook?

434
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
You know, you get those things

435
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,060
and there's an expectation of obedience to those things.

436
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,040
And if you wanna work at a particular company,

437
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,560
then you've signed on and you're going to determine

438
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,720
that you're going to, out of necessity

439
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,040
in keeping your job, you're going to obey those things.

440
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,440
When I went to Bible college, they gave us a handbook.

441
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,920
And then they told us in that handbook,

442
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
some of you guys that went to Bible college

443
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
or Christian college,

444
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,400
you know about this demerit system thing, right?

445
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
And this offense equals these demerits

446
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,400
and so on and so forth.

447
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,000
And there was some motivation

448
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,120
in obeying some of those things

449
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,240
because of wanting to stay out of trouble

450
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,520
and not get the demerits.

451
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
But I would say this, as a child of God,

452
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,360
as a possessor of eternal life,

453
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,400
because of that internal work that God is doing

454
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,280
in my heart, in my life,

455
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,480
the reality is that I desire to obey God.

456
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,680
I want to obey God.

457
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,640
I have the understanding that there is great joy

458
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,160
and there is great delight in obeying my master,

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,360
my savior, my Lord.

460
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,640
When we understand that difference in perspective,

461
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,120
remember what John would have heard Jesus say in John 14,

462
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,160
in verse number 15,

463
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,880
if you love me, keep my commandments.

464
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,120
Within this same book,

465
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,200
turn over to 1 John 5, if you will.

466
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,840
And I want you to see what the word of God says here

467
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,600
in 1 John 5.

468
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Notice in verse number three,

469
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
with regard to obedience,

470
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,240
he says this, for this is the love of God,

471
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,080
that we keep his commandments.

472
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,440
And then notice this phrase,

473
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,360
and his commandments are not grievous.

474
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
Listen, for us as the people of God,

475
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
because of what we've mentioned,

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,040
the true possessor of eternal life,

477
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,720
we know that we know him,

478
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,880
the internal work that is going on,

479
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,680
the love of God that is being perfected in us,

480
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,840
the Holy Spirit of God who now indwells us,

481
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,360
the truth that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

482
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,520
which is in us.

483
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,240
And we understand all of those realities

484
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,200
that God has given us in his word,

485
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,160
then I, as a possessor of eternal life,

486
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
this gift of God,

487
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,360
there ought to be a desire in my heart to obey God.

488
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,560
I just want to obey him.

489
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,920
I delight and I joy in obeying my savior.

490
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,160
As a child, those, all of you have been a child, amen?

491
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
Amen?

492
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,840
I know it's deep for Sunday morning, amen?

493
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,480
Some of us have had children.

494
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,520
You know, there comes a point in your life

495
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,120
when your obedience to your parents changes

496
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,560
from a have to to a want to.

497
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,720
There should be, right?

498
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,560
And you think about if you can evaluate your life,

499
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,720
and perhaps you can remember that time in your own life

500
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,520
where it transferred from being I have to do

501
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,200
what my parents tell me to do

502
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,880
to I want to do what my parents tell me to do.

503
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,360
And I'm not saying that it would be 100%

504
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,880
all of the time across the board,

505
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,160
but the reality is that there comes a place in our lives

506
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,480
we understand in relationship where that transition happens.

507
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,760
And I would say as we think about the heavenly truth

508
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,320
and the reality that he's my heavenly father

509
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,400
and I'm his child, that I want to obey him.

510
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,280
I desire to please my God.

511
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
As we look at the passage of scripture

512
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,520
with the understanding, as I mentioned,

513
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,120
by way of introduction of the verb tense

514
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,600
of that word keepeth, and the greater context

515
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,440
of 1 John into the beginning of the second chapter,

516
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,600
the end of the first chapter with the whole truth

517
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
of confessing our sin, understanding that we're not to sin.

518
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
Remember, he says in verse number one,

519
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,480
my little children, these things write unto you

520
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,400
that you sin not.

521
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,440
That ought to be our goal.

522
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
That ought to be our desire.

523
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,880
But when we sin, we can rejoice that we have an advocate,

524
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,520
Jesus Christ the righteous, amen.

525
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,400
And what a blessing to know that we have the advocate.

526
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,520
And so when we understand the verb tense

527
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
and we understand the greater context

528
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,240
of this passage of scripture,

529
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,400
we would understand that when he says in verse number three

530
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
that we keep his commandments,

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
when he says in verse number five,

532
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,000
whoso keepeth his word, when he says in verse number six

533
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,800
that we ought to walk even as he walked,

534
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,200
that he is not saying that it's going to be

535
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,560
perfect obedience, completely sinless.

536
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,800
Rather, the possessor is going to have

537
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,720
that humble, obedient response

538
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,240
to the commandment of the Lord.

539
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,360
That we understand, listen, there's going to be a time

540
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,440
that we don't, even though we're possessors,

541
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,840
where we don't keep his commandments, amen?

542
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,240
You've sinned, right?

543
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,520
We know, listen, if you say I never sinned,

544
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,640
you better go back to 1 John chapter number one.

545
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,400
Go back a couple weeks and listen to the message, amen?

546
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,640
Because the word of God says you're lying.

547
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,360
You've deceived yourself.

548
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
You make him a liar.

549
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,680
The truth is not in you, right?

550
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,200
Is that not what 1 John one tells us?

551
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,120
So we know the word of God tells us

552
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,520
and experience tells us that we have,

553
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,400
at times after we trusted Christ as our savior,

554
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,840
a possessor of eternal life,

555
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,160
there has been a time where I did not keep his commandment.

556
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,160
Doesn't mean I'm not saved.

557
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,240
No, no.

558
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,880
What's the, when we think about the passage of scripture

559
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,720
and the truth that God is revealing to us here,

560
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
it's not that if you mess up one time

561
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,680
that you must not be a possessor.

562
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,680
It's that we have this attitude towards the word of God

563
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,760
to the commandments of the Lord

564
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,560
that I have this humble, obedient response

565
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,960
to the commandments of the Lord,

566
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,960
and my life is given this evidence

567
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,760
of living a life of obedience,

568
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,720
that that's the pattern that is set forth,

569
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,400
that there is a pattern of obedience.

570
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,320
We said that the verb tense would indicate

571
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,320
that ongoing action, the obedience to keeping his word.

572
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,799
When the word of God is disobeyed in the life of a believer,

573
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,000
the Holy Spirit of God convicts us, amen?

574
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,600
And as that conviction comes in our life,

575
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,000
and some people say, I don't like conviction.

576
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,840
You ought to like conviction.

577
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,520
Conviction's a good thing, amen?

578
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,559
The word of God, my Bible tells me,

579
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,600
and your Bible tells you that whom the Lord loveth,

580
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,640
he chasteneth, amen?

581
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,119
It's an evidence, it's a birthmark of a believer

582
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,200
that God deals with us as children,

583
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,760
and he convicts us, and he chastens us,

584
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
and what's our response to that?

585
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,400
We're a possessor, that internal work is taking place,

586
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,799
and it's evidenced in a life of obedience.

587
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,200
Again, he's not giving the idea

588
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,119
that it's perfect, complete obedience

589
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,119
and living a sinless perfection type of reaching that goal,

590
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,559
but there's this pattern of obedience.

591
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,640
I believe that the next point that we look at

592
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,799
will help us fully come to the conclusion

593
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,360
of this passage of Scripture.

594
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Notice with me, not only the behavior of the possessor,

595
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
but I want you to notice in verse number four, number two,

596
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,119
if you're taking notes, the behavior of the professor.

597
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,119
And when I say a professor,

598
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,400
I'm not talking about your college professor,

599
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,640
but I'm talking about the one that professes

600
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,520
to be something that he is not.

601
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:07,000
The reality is that the Word of God begins in verse number four, he that saith.

602
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,560
I would say this, man can profess anything, can he not?

603
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Man can profess anything.

604
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,720
Let me say it this way, talk is cheap.

605
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,840
Amen?

606
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
Talk is cheap.

607
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,960
Man can say whatever he wants.

608
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,180
In fact, you found, as we looked at the end of chapter number one, that there were many

609
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,980
references as to he that saith.

610
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,200
If we say, the phrase was repeated there three times.

611
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Here we find in verse number four, he that saith, I know him.

612
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,320
Now remember, the litmus test is given in verse number three, that you know, that you

613
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,520
know him, why?

614
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
We keep his commandments.

615
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,800
The internal work of verse number five, that God's love is being perfected in us, that

616
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,200
it's evidenced in the external by our obedience and our walk, and we're walking even as he

617
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
walked.

618
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,120
We find that the professor in verse number four, the one that says, he professes, I know

619
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,760
him.

620
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,200
But notice what it says, and keepeth not his commandments.

621
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,160
He has no regard for the Word of God.

622
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,120
There's a disobedience, this individual really, if they're just a professor, if they simply

623
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:36,000
say that they know him, but they've not actually received him, they are not a possessor of

624
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,160
eternal life, the Holy Spirit is not working within them, that internal work is void.

625
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,840
It's not there.

626
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,380
There's no internal work, and therefore, their behavior is marked by disobedience.

627
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,340
Their behavior is marked by disobedience.

628
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,620
They don't care what God's Word says.

629
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,220
The Holy Spirit of God is not living within them.

630
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
They're not saved.

631
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,900
Now, they say that they know him, but the evidence is not there.

632
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,460
In fact, the evidence is on the contrary.

633
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,260
It says that he keepeth not his commandments.

634
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,860
Notice what God says.

635
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,820
This person is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

636
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,220
You say, man, that's hard language.

637
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,540
It's the Word of God.

638
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,820
It's the Word of God.

639
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,860
God's Word is very direct.

640
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:40,060
There are people that can profess that they know him, but the evidence does not support

641
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,020
their profession.

642
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,220
There's no internal work that's taking place.

643
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,420
They've never truly trusted Christ as their Savior, and the external evidence is that

644
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,500
on the contrary, that they actually are not a possessor, that they've simply professed

645
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
something.

646
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,620
And the Word of God tells us that in this life of this individual that keepeth not his

647
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,500
commandments that they are a liar, and the truth is not in him.

648
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,340
Let me illustrate it this way.

649
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,500
As we mentioned about in our previous point with the possessor in the external evidence

650
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,780
of keeping the Word of God and keeping the commandments and obeying, the reality this

651
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,740
morning is as we look at this professor and we understand that it says that he keepeth

652
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:35,220
not his commandments, you know that even occasionally a lost person will obey a truth of God's Word.

653
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,900
The one that wants to deceive you, the one that's crept in unawares, according to Jude

654
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:49,460
1, that individual that's crept in unawares, they will try to put on this facade of obedience

655
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:58,180
and even the professor, even the lost person occasionally will obey a commandment of the

656
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Lord.

657
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,300
But the pattern of obedience is missing.

658
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,020
Someone said it this way.

659
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,140
You think about hypocrisy and you think about this one in verse number 4, he that saith,

660
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,540
I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him.

661
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:17,480
Again, it's not the individual that occasionally will obey a command of the Lord.

662
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,500
The reality is this, again, someone made this reference, I thought it was quite appropriate,

663
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:30,100
that even a broken clock tells the right time twice a day, right?

664
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,740
That's pretty easy for us to understand.

665
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,300
A broken clock tells the right time twice a day.

666
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,100
You say, well, not if it's military time.

667
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I understand.

668
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:44,700
Amen, for all you military folks out there, amen, I understand.

669
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,820
But I want you to understand this morning, when we think about the truth of verse number

670
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:57,760
4, believe that it helps us understand the truth of verses 3, 5, and 6.

671
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,520
In verse number 4, we see that it's saying that he that says, but he keepeth not his

672
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,600
commandments, though there's the occasional time in which they may obey a principle or

673
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,080
a truth from the Word of God, it does not make them a possessor.

674
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,600
In like fashion, there will be a time in the life of the possessor where we don't perfectly

675
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,760
keep his commandments.

676
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,440
It doesn't make us lost, right?

677
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
You follow?

678
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Does that make sense?

679
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,360
And so it doesn't make us lost if there's that occasional sin in our life, that occasional

680
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,120
time in which we have not kept the commandment of the Lord.

681
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,520
What God is doing for us here in this passage of Scripture, when we think about this truth

682
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,080
and this litmus test, as I've used the analogy from the beginning of the message this morning

683
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,960
that is given to us in verse number 3, the question that we could ask ourselves at the

684
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,080
conclusion of the message this morning is this, what does the test conclude?

685
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,480
This test, I do not believe this morning, though I preach the Word of God and though

686
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:11,960
I preach the truth, the reality is that this is a test that you self-administer, that you

687
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,440
examine your own life.

688
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,040
And then as you examine your own life and as you begin to understand, listen, God wants

689
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,520
you to know that you belong to Him.

690
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,840
Many of us have children.

691
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,760
Those of us that have children, do you not want your children to know your love for them

692
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,960
and that they belong to you?

693
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,840
That they would be secure in their relationship physically with you as parent to child?

694
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
Sure you do.

695
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,400
You don't want your child to come running up to you as just a little toddler and kind

696
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,840
of push them off and go somewhere else.

697
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,520
No, no, you want them to know that there's a relationship, there's security.

698
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,640
You want your children to be able to come to you and to know that they are secure in

699
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,960
their relationship, right?

700
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,800
In like fashion, God wants us to be secure in knowing that we belong to Him, that we

701
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
are in Him.

702
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,920
And so He provides us throughout the book of 1 John, really throughout the Word of God.

703
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,600
There are many passages that you could go to, but I believe that as you go through the

704
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:31,200
book of 1 John, you'll find many ways the approach that is given to us by God in this

705
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,840
book, this short epistle, is that God says, you can say whatever you want to say, but

706
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,240
here's the test.

707
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't say that you love God and hate your brother.

708
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,160
Because if you hate your brother, you don't love God, right?

709
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,640
We'll get to that in a little while.

710
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,520
And He uses these tests throughout the book of 1 John to help us truly evaluate why.

711
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,600
Well, one truth that we find in the Word of God, and He mentions it in 1 John 1, is that

712
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,480
we can deceive ourselves.

713
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,420
Now, I want you to consider that just for a moment as we close up this morning and we

714
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,780
think about this.

715
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,620
The devil is a liar, is he not?

716
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,620
And the devil is a deceiver, correct?

717
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,240
He uses deception all the way from the beginning, right?

718
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,620
And if we know that he's a deceiver, and we know that he's a liar, he wants to deceive

719
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:31,020
you, and we know that there's a danger in deceiving ourselves, God graciously provides

720
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:38,660
us with some test that we can administer so that we can know and not be deceived.

721
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,080
Isn't that awesome?

722
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,980
When you think about the wisdom of God, and you think about the love of God, and God says,

723
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,140
I want you to know that you know.

724
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,340
I don't want you to be tossed to and fro.

725
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,540
I don't want you to not have this knowledge.

726
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:06,179
And He says, hereby we do know that we know Him, that we keep His commandments, that we

727
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,220
keep His Word, that we walk as He walked.

728
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,059
The focus this morning is not so much on the professor.

729
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,360
The behavior the professor has given to us in verse number 4, the one that professes

730
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,619
to know Him but keepeth not His commandments, that person's a liar.

731
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,260
The truth is not in him.

732
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,540
As just a moment of speaking to one that perhaps would fall into that category, I would submit

733
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,860
to you that you must make sure that you are born again.

734
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:43,140
It's not just a lip service profession.

735
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,460
Evaluate the evidence in your own life.

736
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,140
Am I a professor or am I a possessor?

737
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,100
Do I possess eternal life or do I just profess to know Him?

738
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,179
What does my life conclude as I look at the test?

739
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,179
What is it in my life that I am a professor or am I a possessor?

740
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,179
What does my life conclude as I look at the test?

741
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:01,179


742
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:07,339
life as a believer, see, the reality is that as a believer, as I mentioned a few moments

743
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:13,499
ago, we ought to have a desire, a want to, with regard to obedience to the Word of God.

744
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,859
We agree that this book is God's book.

745
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:16,859
It's God's Word.

746
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:17,859
Amen?

747
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,339
We agree on that.

748
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:25,979
You sit in a church this morning that has as its authority this book.

749
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:31,379
The Word of God is our sole authority for faith and practice.

750
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:37,019
And I've often said over the years that we must agree to agree with God, that we go to

751
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:42,419
the Word of God and we agree with what God says.

752
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:49,579
And as a believer, as a possessor, that internal work that is taking place, and the Holy Spirit

753
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:54,799
of God is working in my life and in my heart, and I read the Word of God in my daily devotions

754
00:40:54,799 --> 00:41:00,159
or as I come to a church meeting and I hear the preaching and the teaching of the Word

755
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:07,079
of God, that I'm taking that truth and I'm saying, how do I apply that truth in my life?

756
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,919
How do I become a doer of the Word?

757
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:11,199
I want to keep His commandments.

758
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,039
Oh, by the power of God, with the help of God, would you help me to walk in obedience?

759
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,999
Would you help me to submit to that truth?

760
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,499
Would you help me to live out that truth in my life?

761
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:29,859
And that's the response of the possessor.

762
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,299
We continue to desire the internal work.

763
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:35,139
God, keep working in my life.

764
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,659
Keep showing me.

765
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,419
Keep revealing to me.

766
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:45,459
Help me, God, by Your power and Your strength to obey Your Word.

767
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:50,899
We look at our lives and we say, man, this possessor, he's keeping the Word of God.

768
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:59,779
He's keeping the commandments of the Lord, and the external evidence proves the profession

769
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:02,539
that I'm in Christ, that I'm in Him.

770
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:10,059
And this morning, I'm so thankful that God has given this first of several that we will

771
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:16,079
discuss over the year of a test, a birthmark of a believer.

772
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,839
Our life is to be evidence of that work that God is doing in us.

773
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,159
As we take a moment at the end of our service to examine our own lives and say, how am I

774
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,879
doing in this area?

775
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,000
Am I keeping His commandments?

776
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,319
Am I walking as He walked?

777
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,559
Do I know His commandments?

778
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,479
This morning, walk as He walked.

779
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,479
Walk as He walked.

780
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:48,039
Many years ago, I don't think it's too prevalent today, though it may be.

781
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:55,439
Some could correct me if I'm off on this, but I think it was a while ago.

782
00:42:55,439 --> 00:43:01,319
Again, it's still occasionally tossed around, but it was very prevalent years ago, and that

783
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,719
was that little, what would Jesus do?

784
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,719
Right?

785
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:11,079
You remember everyone's wearing these little wristbands, WWJD, and run around with this

786
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,519
idea of what would Jesus do?

787
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:21,519
Sadly, I would say that oftentimes, we don't even know what Jesus would do because we don't

788
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,359
know this book.

789
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:31,639
And it's more than just wearing some paraphernalia, it's having that internal work where God's

790
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:37,119
Holy Spirit is working in my life and revealing truth to me.

791
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,959
And as I walk in the light, and I walk as He walked, that I follow His steps, the example

792
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:50,399
that He gave us, that truly, we could follow that question of what would Jesus do?

793
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:56,679
Because I'm walking in the light, our theme, and I'm walking as He walked.

794
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:01,279
The life of a believer should be marked with obedience, amen?

795
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:03,439
It really should.

796
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:05,199
Marked by obedience.

797
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:11,279
There should be a pattern of obedience in your life and in my life.

798
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:17,519
Again, no one ever has been and no one ever will be saved by keeping His commandments.

799
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:24,839
John's not talking about salvation of how to, he's talking about the possessor of salvation.

800
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,959
And here's how you know, that you know Him, if we keep His commandments.

801
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:29,959
Let's pray.

802
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,039
Father, we love You.

803
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,079
We thank You for loving us.

804
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,239
We thank You for the Word of God.

805
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:43,079
We thank You for this truth that has been revealed to us in this passage of Scripture,

806
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:52,359
this birthmark of a believer, this security that You want us to know.

807
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:59,079
I'm so thankful that You know that we have this need as human beings, a need to know

808
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,119
that we are secure, a need of security, and You have provided within Your Word many examples

809
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
of how we can know that we know You, that we are in Christ.

810
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:22,839
This one that is before us this morning, I pray that You'd help us to evaluate our lives.

811
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:29,839
I trust that those that are gathered here this morning are possessors, that, God, You're

812
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:38,880
doing a work internally in each of us, that the evidence is seen on the external.

813
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:49,239
There may be one that the Holy Spirit may have convicted this morning, they're just

814
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:57,119
a professor, there's never actually been a time in which they've been born again.

815
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,959
If that would be You this morning, I trust that You would respond to the invitation that

816
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:09,959
the Lord extends, whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, that

817
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,160
You would receive the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

818
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:22,239
and no longer would You be just a professor, that You would be a possessor of eternal life.

819
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:30,720
For each one that's here that's accepted the gift of God, that's saved. God, I pray that

820
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:39,119
our lives would be marked by obedience, that our heart attitude would be one of submission

821
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:47,119
and obedience as we come to Your Word. In fact, that we would read Your Word daily with

822
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:56,639
the purpose of obedience. We think of Samuel when he said, "'Speak, Lord, for Thy servant

823
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:04,959
heareth,' hearing with the purpose of obeying." David, the example in 1 Samuel 16, God knew

824
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:12,959
his heart. That unnamed servant of Saul observed the external evidence of what God knew to

825
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:26,919
be done internally. God, I pray that'd be our testimony this morning, that our lives

826
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,000
would clearly indicate that we belong to You and that we are a possessor of eternal life.

827
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:42,519
Thank You for the work that You do in us. God, help us to have that desire for You to

828
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:49,519
continue by Your power and with Your help that we would be doers of the Word, that we

829
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,320
would keep Your commandments. Would You work in these few moments of invitation? Help us

830
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,679
to respond as You've spoken to our hearts, and we'll thank You for it. Would You stand

831
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,119
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

832
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,959
As she does, the altar is open. Maybe this morning you want to come and just thank God

833
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:15,559
for the internal work that He's doing in you. Thank Him for salvation. Maybe this morning

834
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,919
you want to come and ask Him to continue to reveal to you, to help you to walk in obedience,

835
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:25,899
to keep His commandments. Not sure how the Lord may have spoken to your heart this morning,

836
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:30,739
but as He has, would you respond as Kimberly plays, The Altar is Open?
