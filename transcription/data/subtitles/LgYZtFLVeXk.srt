1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
to 2 Timothy chapter number two.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,880
And we've been dealing with this series

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,899
throughout the calendar year of 2024 of continue.

4
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,779
It's our theme for this year.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,760
And as Pierre mentioned,

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,800
it's October is right around the corner

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,360
and it's hard to believe we're nearing the end.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,879
And I've mapped out,

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,520
not completed each message for the rest of the year,

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,540
but every time around September and October,

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,200
I have to map out to make sure

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,500
I'm gonna have enough Sundays to finish up

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,259
what it is that we're going to have for our theme.

14
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,220
And so I'm excited about what God has in store for us

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,459
and praying about a theme for next year.

16
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:41,659
And my target date typically is October 1st

17
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,659
to have all of that ready to roll.

18
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,380
And so you pray that God will give wisdom and direction,

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,180
but I'm thankful for this series,

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,779
first and second Timothy, the thought of continue.

21
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,340
No doubt we live as we come to the third chapter

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,880
in a few weeks in a time of being the last days,

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,959
perilous times as they are described for us.

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,659
And we see all kinds of things going on in our world

25
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,300
and turmoil and so on and so forth,

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,099
but we serve a God who is on his throne,

27
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,300
who has a plan, who do with all things well,

28
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,419
his way is perfect, amen.

29
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:17,360
And I am thankful to know him as my personal Lord and Savior

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,699
and thankful for the opportunity

31
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:23,099
that we have to serve him as soldiers in the Lord's army.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,360
When you trust at Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,519
you were enlisted in the Lord's army

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,919
and praise the Lord for that truth.

35
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:35,980
And we find that God gives us in this passage

36
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,440
in second Timothy chapter number two,

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,720
really the entirety of the chapter,

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,360
much information with regard to being not only a soldier

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,239
in the Lord's army, but a good soldier.

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,319
And that's been the thought for a few weeks now

41
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,440
here on Sunday mornings.

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm not content.

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
I don't wanna be content.

44
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:54,739
I don't want you to be content with just simply saying,

45
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm a soldier in the Lord's army.

46
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,699
No, I wanna be a good soldier.

47
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,959
We find that within the text of scripture,

48
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,099
there are five characteristics that God gives us

49
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,980
that would cause a soldier to be referred to

50
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,380
as being a good soldier.

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,419
And we see that in verse number three,

52
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,979
thou therefore endure hardness

53
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,179
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

54
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,300
The Christian life is a spiritual warfare.

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,559
We find that the battle is raging

56
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,259
and too many soldiers in the Lord's army

57
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,679
are ill prepared for the battle.

58
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,860
And that's just the reality.

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,080
That's just the way it is.

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,479
And it's unfortunate, but it's the truth.

61
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,360
And we must preach the truth.

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,399
We must analyze and be able to examine

63
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:44,039
and to honestly evaluate where we are individually

64
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,639
and where we are as a church locally,

65
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,619
but then also the body of Christ broadly speaking.

66
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,539
It seems as if I made this comment to someone yesterday

67
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,899
when we were going apple picking,

68
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,660
but it seems as if some in our society today

69
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,320
that are saved by the grace of God,

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,660
they're enlisted in the army of the Lord's army

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,740
that they enjoy being a soldier,

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,300
but simply want no part of combat.

73
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Now think about that just for a moment.

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,880
They're happy to be a soldier.

75
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,059
They're happy that they're saved.

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,339
They're happy that they're going to heaven,

77
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,259
but they really don't want any part of combat.

78
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,000
They don't want to be engaged in the battle.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,119
They don't want to be in the spiritual warfare,

80
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,199
but we understand that Paul says to the believers

81
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,720
in Ephesus in Ephesians six,

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,199
that we're to be strong in the Lord

83
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,520
and the power of his might.

84
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
He says in verse number 12,

85
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,639
that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

86
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,479
but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

87
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,880
And we see that we understand I've made known for years now

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,320
when we look at our society

89
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,919
and we look at the problems and all that's taking place.

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,660
Many people try to say that we're dealing with cultural war.

91
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,479
We're dealing with this social war, so on and so forth,

92
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,220
but really we're dealing with spiritual warfare.

93
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,119
It takes on many shapes and forms.

94
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,860
It's called a number of different things,

95
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,899
but we understand as Bible believers

96
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:04,580
that it is a fight between evil and good.

97
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,820
And we understand that it's a spiritual battle.

98
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,479
We must come into the spiritual battle

99
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,539
prepared for combat, being strong in the Lord.

100
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,640
And we find that as we have that desire

101
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,119
that we would be a good soldier of Jesus Christ

102
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:24,160
refusing to be content with average.

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,279
You know, there are a lot of people today

104
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,160
that are just okay with status quo,

105
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,160
just kind of, I'm getting by, I'm making it, I'm average.

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,640
And I hope that that would not be our place

107
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,920
of being content there,

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,640
but that we would strive for excellence

109
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
in the Christian life,

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,339
that we would strive to be in a place

111
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,200
where God would be pleased with us,

112
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,220
that we would honor and glorify him,

113
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,700
that truly it would be said of each and every one of us,

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,820
not only that we're a soldier,

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,459
but we're a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

116
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,019
We looked at in the first lesson

117
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,260
that a good soldier endures hardness.

118
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,940
We noticed that in verse number three.

119
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,059
I read it a moment ago,

120
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,880
thou therefore endure hardness

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,959
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

122
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,339
Two weeks ago, we dealt with the first part

123
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,600
of verse number four,

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,420
that a good soldier avoids distractions.

125
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,260
The Bible says, no man that woreth

126
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,299
and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life.

127
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,739
The distractions will vary.

128
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,380
The distractions are abundant,

129
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,619
but we know that our enemy, he is a master deceiver,

130
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:33,179
and he distracts us in so many ways.

131
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,940
There's so many distractions around us,

132
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,459
and we must be focused on the Lord Jesus Christ

133
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,760
and on the work that he has for us

134
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,880
because we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

135
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,059
We can no longer afford to be distracted.

136
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,640
We can't be, as I said two weeks ago, asleep at the wheel.

137
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
We must be alert.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,040
We must be vigilant.

139
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
Remember what the Bible says

140
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,679
in 1 Peter chapter number five, in verse number 80,

141
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,399
it says, be sober, be vigilant.

142
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,279
Why?

143
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,119
Because your adversary,

144
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,000
we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,040
as a roaring lion walketh about,

146
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,059
seeking whom he may devour.

147
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,279
He wants to destroy your life.

148
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,660
He wants to devour you.

149
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,140
Here's what I'm thankful for.

150
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,140
He has no power over me with regard to going to heaven.

151
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,779
He can't take my salvation.

152
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,179
Hallelujah.

153
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,839
I am kept in the hand of God, amen.

154
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,420
But you know, he wants to destroy our lives.

155
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,339
He wants to destroy our testimonies.

156
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,140
He wants to destroy our effectiveness.

157
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,660
He wants to devour you, your spouse, your children.

158
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,480
He wants to devour.

159
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,279
And so we find that the Bible says, be sober, be vigilant.

160
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,200
And we find here that this soldier, this good soldier,

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,679
number one, he endures hardness.

162
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,320
Number two, he avoids distractions.

163
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,799
This morning, we'll look at the remainder

164
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,760
of verse number four.

165
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,059
The Bible says that he, that good soldier

166
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,920
that's referenced in verse number three,

167
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,179
that he may please him.

168
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,019
Who's him?

169
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,679
Well, that's the Lord Jesus Christ.

170
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,660
That is our savior who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

171
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,140
Again, when you got saved by the grace of God,

172
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,679
you were enlisted in the Lord's army.

173
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,700
You didn't get saved and then make a decision.

174
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,980
You know, do I want to sign up

175
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,600
to be in the Lord's army or not?

176
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,980
And you know, I'm gonna evaluate.

177
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,820
No, no, when you got saved, whether you knew it or not,

178
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,320
now you do, you were enlisted in the Lord's army.

179
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,339
That's his plan.

180
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,380
He hath chosen you to be a soldier.

181
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,579
And notice the Bible says that he, that soldier,

182
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,880
that good soldier may please him, the Lord Jesus Christ,

183
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,440
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

184
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,040
So this morning, as we note the third characteristic

185
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,559
of a good soldier, I would say this,

186
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:49,799
they seek to please their master.

187
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:53,799
A good soldier seeks to please their master.

188
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,239
I made the statement on Wednesday evening,

189
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,959
too many people that are saved,

190
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,739
they are interested in having a savior,

191
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,920
but not a Lord or a master.

192
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:07,579
They want a savior.

193
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,579
They want to go to heaven when they die,

194
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,779
but they really don't want a master.

195
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,339
They don't want Jesus to be Lord of their lives.

196
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,380
What do I mean by that?

197
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,299
Well, they want to just do what pleases them.

198
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,420
They want to live their life.

199
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,260
They want the benefit of heaven, so to speak,

200
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,940
but they want to do whatever it is

201
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,500
that they want to do here on this side of eternity.

202
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,119
They want to live to please themselves.

203
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,960
We all know people that are living to please themselves.

204
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,520
We know, by the way, where that ends.

205
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,039
We know the futility of it.

206
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
We know that it brings no real true peace and joy,

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,479
that it's empty, it's vain, but we find this morning

208
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:47,320
that the good soldier, he is going to seek

209
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,200
to please his master, understanding

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,340
that not only is Jesus my savior,

211
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,880
but he is my Lord and my master.

212
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,219
By the way, he's a good Lord.

213
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,099
He's a good master.

214
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:01,080
His commandments are not grievous, amen?

215
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,940
Some people look and they try to attack the scripture

216
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,799
and they say, well, you know, the Christian life

217
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,979
is just a whole list of do's and don'ts.

218
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,640
If you look at it that way, you have missed

219
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,679
the whole point of the relationship

220
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,320
that you have with the Lord Jesus Christ,

221
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,059
and are there things that he tells us not to do?

222
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,299
Sure.

223
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,099
Are there things that he tells us that we should do?

224
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,539
Absolutely, but if you have children,

225
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,580
you have a list of things that they should do

226
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,000
and they should not do.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Why?

228
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
Because you love them.

229
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,840
Because you love them.

230
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,320
And God as our Lord and our master and our savior,

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,679
he's given to us in his word truth

232
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,679
that helps us understand how we can please him.

233
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,039
Note this, you don't need to turn there.

234
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm gonna read the verse for you,

235
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,760
but in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number four,

236
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,700
the apostle Paul is writing to this church

237
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
that he had the privilege of going

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,440
and preaching the gospel to.

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,940
He says, but as we were allowed of God

240
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,400
to be put in trust with the gospel,

241
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
even so we speak.

242
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,840
Notice where he says, not as pleasing men.

243
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,180
but God, which trieth our hearts.

244
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,140
It ought to be the desire of every child of God.

245
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,700
It ought to be the desire of every saved,

246
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,700
blood-bought child of God to please their master.

247
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,220
We find that a good soldier, according to verse number four,

248
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,940
it says that he may please him

249
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,540
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

250
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,820
Let me ask you, I'm gonna ask two questions this morning

251
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,540
as we deal with the subject matter.

252
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,060
Number one, if you're taking notes,

253
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,060
can I, can you, can we please the Lord?

254
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,140
You ever found yourself in a situation

255
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,280
where you found like, or you felt like

256
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,020
you found yourself in a situation

257
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,620
where you had a desire to please

258
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,980
maybe an employer or somebody else,

259
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,060
but you found yourself, I don't know how,

260
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,740
I feel like I cannot please this person.

261
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,780
It seems like everything I do is wrong.

262
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,460
You ever been there, you feel that way?

263
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,940
And I'm sure that at some point in life,

264
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,020
a teacher, a professor, a coworker, an employer,

265
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,420
whoever it might be, that we have felt that way,

266
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,560
but we find that we come to the scriptures

267
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,340
and we come to the truth that is before us this morning,

268
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,800
we can rejoice in knowing that I can please the Lord.

269
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,380
You can live your life, I can live my life,

270
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,620
we can live our lives in such a way

271
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,460
that the Lord Jesus Christ would be pleased with us.

272
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,100
And by the way, he's revealed to us in his word,

273
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,560
we'll deal with that in just a moment,

274
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,700
but we wanna answer the question, can I?

275
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,660
There's some people that go through life and they say,

276
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,620
well, I can't please God anyway.

277
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,460
Well, you can please God.

278
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,580
And it is absolutely possible,

279
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,700
we see it in 1 Thessalonians 2,

280
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,920
where Paul says that he's seeking to please God,

281
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,340
not pleasing men, but pleasing God.

282
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,340
If the apostle Paul understood that he was able to serve

283
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,100
in such a way that he could bring honor and glory

284
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,580
to his savior to please his Lord,

285
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,820
then we understand this morning

286
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,100
that we too can please the Lord.

287
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,800
In 1 Thessalonians 4, in fact, turn over there if you will,

288
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,900
we find that Paul gave his testimony in the second chapter

289
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,140
with regard to his entrance into and how he recognized

290
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,060
that he had been privileged to preach the gospel,

291
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,060
but he was seeking in doing so to please God

292
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,820
because he understood that that was pleasing in his sight.

293
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,620
But notice as he's writing in chapter number four

294
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,900
to these believers, these in Thessalonica,

295
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,020
he's encouraging them with regard that they too

296
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,300
can please the Lord with their lives.

297
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,420
In verse number one of 1 Thessalonians 4,

298
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,400
the Bible says, furthermore then,

299
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,440
we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,

300
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,540
that as ye have received of us,

301
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,860
notice how ye ought to walk and to please God,

302
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,420
so ye would abound more and more,

303
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,420
for ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

304
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,300
And so as Paul is writing here

305
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,540
to these believers in Thessalonica,

306
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,700
not only did he tell them in the second chapter

307
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,140
that he was living and behaving in such a way

308
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,360
that he would please God, not men,

309
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,740
that he would please God,

310
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,100
that then he tells these believers

311
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,280
that they have received truth.

312
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,640
He mentions that truth in verse number two

313
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,800
as being the commandments that they gave Paul

314
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,120
to these believers in Thessalonica,

315
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,600
notice, by the Lord Jesus.

316
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,400
These weren't commands that just Paul was making up

317
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,220
and adding these things.

318
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,960
No, Paul was giving the commands

319
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,400
as the Lord had given the commands.

320
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,120
And he says this, that you've received them.

321
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,240
Well, you've received, you've been instructed

322
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,240
on how ye ought to walk, and then notice the phrase,

323
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,720
and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

324
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,920
And so we find that the Apostle Paul

325
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
is saying to these believers in Thessalonica,

326
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
listen, you can please God with your life.

327
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,020
And I've given you the instruction, God has enabled me,

328
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,580
God has allowed me to be the individual,

329
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,460
the mouthpiece, if you will,

330
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,160
that brought this truth to you

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
so that you would know how you can please the Lord.

332
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
And then he ends it by saying this,

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,540
so you would abound more and more.

334
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,600
Live your life to please the Lord, why?

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,060
Because it's possible.

336
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,640
Notice the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you will,

337
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
in John chapter number eight.

338
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Turn back, if you will, to John chapter number eight.

339
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,600
Now, we know that Jesus is God in flesh,

340
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,040
and what a blessing to understand that command

341
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,720
or that truth, and we find that Jesus, as God,

342
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
he left his throne in heaven,

343
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,280
he came to this sin-cursed world,

344
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,840
he lived a perfect, sinless life,

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,840
and he went to the cruel cross so that we could be saved.

346
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,240
And what a joy that is to know.

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,800
But he makes this statement in John chapter number eight,

348
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,480
and what a great truth.

349
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,920
The Bible says, and he that sent me is with me,

350
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
the Father hath not left me alone,

351
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,680
for I do always those things that please him.

352
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,600
I want you to think about your life,

353
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,360
and I want you to examine, as I have,

354
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
and I wonder today, now obviously we understand

355
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,840
that Jesus is God, he's perfect, and we are not,

356
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,760
but I wonder if we would evaluate our lives,

357
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,120
I know that we could not say that I do always

358
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,920
those things that please the Lord,

359
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,120
because we are sinners and we fail,

360
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,000
but I wonder if there's more things that we do in our life

361
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,400
that please him than not.

362
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,240
If we truly evaluate our lives,

363
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,760
if we look at our last days that we've walked on this earth,

364
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,720
as we look at the last few days,

365
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,320
did I please the Lord with how I walked?

366
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
Did I please the Lord with the things that I said?

367
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,200
Did I please the Lord?

368
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,800
Because I can please God, I can please him.

369
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,720
And Jesus says, I do always those things that please him.

370
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,960
There's a man in the Old Testament,

371
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,760
we'll look at the testimony of this man

372
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,240
in the book of Hebrews, in the 11th chapter,

373
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,800
if you'd turn there just for a moment,

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Hebrews chapter number 11.

375
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,160
We think about this great hall of faith chapter

376
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
and how God has given to us the testimonies

377
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,320
of those that live by faith.

378
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
And by the way, the Bible tells us

379
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,920
the just shall live by faith.

380
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,540
We are to take God at his word, to believe him,

381
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,380
God is pleased when we live a life of faith,

382
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,400
and we'll mention that in just a few moments,

383
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,320
but look here, in Hebrews chapter 11,

384
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,640
in verse number five, God tells us about a man

385
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,360
by the name of Enoch.

386
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,160
And the Bible says that Enoch in verse number five,

387
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,160
by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death.

388
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Notice and was not found because God had translated him

389
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,600
for before his translation, he had this testimony

390
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,200
that he pleased God, that he pleased God.

391
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,320
Isn't that a simple testimony, but so powerful.

392
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,040
I mean, it's just a simple statement.

393
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Enoch pleased God, praise the Lord, that he pleased God.

394
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,120
He lived in such a way, and by the way,

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,840
we understand historically, if you were to go back

396
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,360
to Genesis five, just on the eve of Genesis six

397
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,920
and the great global flood and all that would take place.

398
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,900
And obviously the Bible tells us that Noah found grace

399
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,860
in the eyes of the Lord, but the reality is

400
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,660
that he was living, Noah was, during a time

401
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,660
of great wickedness, and Noah was able to walk with God

402
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,660
and please God and find grace in the sight of God.

403
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,860
But so was Enoch as we look in the fifth chapter,

404
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
again, all of those things of wickedness

405
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,980
that were going on, and Enoch had this testimony

406
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,420
that he pleased God.

407
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,700
Now understand this isn't Enoch writing about himself.

408
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,060
This is God writing about Enoch.

409
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,780
And I wonder today if God were to write about your life,

410
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,180
if he were to write about my life,

411
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,060
if he would sum up our testimony in the same way.

412
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,660
They pleased me.

413
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,260
They lived in such a way that they, see because we can.

414
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,820
We can please God.

415
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,980
We can please him with our lives.

416
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,420
The record that we see in these few verses of scripture

417
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,420
answer the question with great certainty

418
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,780
that absolutely we can live in such a way

419
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,140
that God is pleased.

420
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,900
If it's true that we can live in such a way

421
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,380
that God is pleased, it's also true

422
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,300
that we can live in such a way that God is not pleased.

423
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,460
Amen.

424
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,059
And our behavior matters to God.

425
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,940
There are some people that have the idea, antinomianism,

426
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,180
if you've heard about the subject, the terminology,

427
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,580
they believe, they teach that you're saved by grace,

428
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,380
you can kind of just live however you want to live,

429
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
and you're just gonna go to heaven when you die.

430
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,540
And the reality is that I'm thankful

431
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,260
that salvation is eternally secure,

432
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,300
that I can't work for my salvation,

433
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,180
nor can I work to keep my salvation.

434
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,740
But the Bible does tell us that if any man be in Christ,

435
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,540
he is a new creature, old things are passed away,

436
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,540
behold, all things become new.

437
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,700
The Bible tells us that we are his workmanship

438
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,280
created in Christ Jesus unto good works.

439
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,140
We find that the Bible tells us as James deals with it,

440
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,059
and he deals with the fruit of salvation,

441
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,140
not so much as Paul deals with the root of salvation.

442
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,940
He says, you say that you have faith, show me your works.

443
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,380
Your works prove your faith.

444
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,340
And we understand that to be true.

445
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,100
James is not complicating the situation

446
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,260
and expressing that there's some way

447
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,180
that you can be saved by your works.

448
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,100
No, he's simply saying that if you are saved,

449
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,740
it will be evidenced in how you live, amen.

450
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,340
And we find this morning that if we,

451
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,460
understand that God has saved us, if we have that goal and that desire, that we

452
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,540
would please Him who has chosen us to be a soldier, that we would desire to please

453
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,660
Him, but understanding this morning that I can. It is a goal that can be

454
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,300
achieved. There are times in life where you might think, well, I've set these

455
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,420
goals and these goals are just not attainable. And oftentimes in the

456
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,300
beginning of a calendar year, I'll challenge people about setting spiritual

457
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,220
goals for the upcoming year and dealing with various things with regard to Bible

458
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,940
reading and prayer time and witnessing opportunities and so on and so forth. And

459
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,140
why? Because we want to have, if you don't have a goal, you just just go through

460
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,340
life aimlessly, helplessly, hopelessly. You just, you just have, you're just no

461
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,100
direction. But set some goals. I've encouraged people this way. Listen, don't

462
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,220
set your goal to read the Bible for three hours a day if you're not reading

463
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,500
it for three minutes a day right now. Why? It's just not attainable. It's not

464
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,380
realistic. If you're reading your Bible for two hours and 30 minutes a day right

465
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,020
now and you say, you know what, I want to read it for three hours a day, praise the

466
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,620
Lord. It's a, it's an attainable, it's a, it's a goal that is possible. This truth

467
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,140
that is before us this morning, I'm thankful that we can please God. And it's

468
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,980
not a moving target. It's not something that's just like, oh, I don't know what to

469
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,860
do. I don't know how to do. Is it even possible? Yes, it's possible. And we answer

470
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,700
the question, can I? And now we answer the question number two, how can I please

471
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,660
God? It's important that we understand that we can, but then we get to the, to

472
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:53,420
the nuts and bolts, if you will, of how can I? I understand that I'm, I can, but

473
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,060
now how do I do it? Well, there's two important principles that I'd like to

474
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,780
consider and then kind of jump into some thoughts, practical application, if you

475
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,660
will. And the first one is a truth that we find in Romans chapter number eight.

476
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,220
Look in Romans chapter number eight, if you will. Now understand that as we got

477
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,660
saved, that, that our spirit, we were made alive. We were quickened. Ephesians

478
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,060
two talks about those of us that were dead, that we were quickened, we were made

479
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,460
alive. And at the moment of salvation, Galatians describes it this way, that,

480
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,260
that there's this battle between our flesh and our spirit. The Bible says that

481
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,700
they're at enmity, one against the other. And we understand the great promise of

482
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,740
Galatians five, that if we walk in the spirit, we shall not fulfill the lust of

483
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,580
the flesh. It'd be wonderful from a human perspective, but we understand and we

484
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,340
submit ourselves to the plan of God. We, sometimes we say, man, I wish that we

485
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,900
just didn't have this flesh anymore. But at the moment of salvation, it was just

486
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,580
eradicated. And I understand the positive idea of that, but that's not how God

487
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,740
chose it to be. And we still have the flesh with the carnal desires and the lust

488
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,100
of the flesh is still there, but the Bible says that if I walk in the spirit,

489
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,660
I will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. He gives me power. He gives me victory.

490
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,220
And we understand that. And so when we look at the truth that's before us in

491
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,940
Romans chapter number eight, I want you to consider this vital principle as we

492
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,900
seek to answer the question, how can I please the Lord? Understanding that I can,

493
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:36,420
but now how? Notice verse number eight, so then they that are in the flesh, notice

494
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,980
what it says, can not please God. Now, do you know what it is when you're in the

495
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:51,340
flesh? I'm asking, do you know as a Christian, as a child of God that's been

496
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,100
saved for a period of time, do you know in your life personally what it is when

497
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,300
you're in the flesh? Can you feel it? Can you understand the feeling that you get

498
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:07,140
when you're like, I'm in the flesh right now? And sometimes you say, I want to be

499
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,380
in the flesh for a minute right now. No, you should stop right there and you

500
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,260
should pray and you should confess and you should, but we're all humans. I'm just

501
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm trying to be helpful this morning because we all deal with the flesh and

502
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,620
you let somebody say something to you, do something to you, and all of a sudden you

503
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,580
can, that old man can revive in a moment. Yes, the principle is true that we're to

504
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,780
put off and put on, put off the old man, put on the new, and what great truth we

505
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,980
find in Ephesians and Colossians with regard to doing that. But you understand

506
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,460
that Paul said, I am crucified with Christ and I die daily, and even if you

507
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,420
do that, in a moment's time that old man can be revived. And you can be in the

508
00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:00,580
flesh in a hurry. Am I right? And the Bible says in Romans 8 and verse number 8,

509
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:12,460
that if we're in the flesh, we can not please God. We cannot please God. So we

510
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,980
ought not walk in the flesh. We ought not walk according to the former lusts and

511
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,860
desires. We need to walk in the Spirit. It's an important principle that we

512
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,460
understand as we seek to answer the question, how can I please the Lord? I

513
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,420
understand that I can, but then how can I? We must recognize that if we're in the

514
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,700
flesh, we're not going to be able to please God. We're not going to be. Why?

515
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,500
There's a great contrast. It's amazing, in verse number 6, if you look at just a

516
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,860
few verses up, it says, for to be carnally minded is death, but to be

517
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,140
spiritually minded is life and peace. There's a great contrast that we find. We

518
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,980
mentioned in Hebrews 11 and verse number 5, the testimony of Enoch, but verse

519
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,540
number 6 says that without faith it is impossible to please Him, for they that

520
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,020
believe, they that come to God must believe that He is and that He's a

521
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,140
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. And so we find here that this idea

522
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,980
of walking in the flesh, and we know what it is, we've experienced it, and we know,

523
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,500
and we know the fact that they're at enmity, the flesh and the spirit, one

524
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,540
against the other, but we must understand this morning that if we're going to live

525
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,740
in the flesh, if we're going to mind the things of the flesh, we're not going to

526
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,580
please God. He's not going to be pleased with our lives. The second important

527
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,180
principle is found in Ephesians chapter 5. Notice with me in Ephesians chapter

528
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,260
number 5, and it's an important truth that is a simple verse of Scripture that

529
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:45,020
gives us great work to do. Why do I say that? Well Ephesians 5 in verse number

530
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:54,260
10 says, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. That word acceptable is also

531
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:00,100
translated in our Bibles as well-pleasing. So we find that what is

532
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,580
acceptable to the Lord is pleasing to the Lord, and we find here that it says

533
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,700
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. What does it mean to prove something? What

534
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,940
is the process that's being done here? There's this process of proving. It was

535
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:21,100
often used in metalworking, and getting an element, silver was very common.

536
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,020
They would go through that process of purifying the silver. They're proving it.

537
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,300
They're getting out all of the things that need to be taken out and

538
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,580
withdrawn, and they're purifying, and here we say proving. It's that work, and

539
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,940
we dig into the Scriptures, and we're seeking to prove what is acceptable unto

540
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,860
the Lord. What is well-pleasing to God? Well in our journey of doing this, as we

541
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,900
have the opportunity to go through and to study the Scriptures, we have many

542
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,060
examples that God has given us with regard to things that please Him and

543
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,300
things that do not please Him. In fact, there's a great example of something

544
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,380
that does not please Him. We mentioned already in Romans 8 about walking in the

545
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,900
flesh, but notice, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10. In 1

546
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,620
Corinthians chapter number 10, the Bible tells us, as God is using Paul to

547
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,460
minister to these believers in Corinth, and he's going back to the Old Testament

548
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,020
and says, in fact, in the text of Scripture that the things that were

549
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,860
written aforetime are written for our admonition. I'm so thankful that God

550
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,059
chose to preserve the Old Testament. The Old Testament, listen, all Scripture is

551
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,780
given by inspiration of God. That means from Genesis 1-1 to Revelation 22-21, amen?

552
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,500
All of it is inspired by God, and it is profitable. So I don't, a certain

553
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,180
portion of the Scripture, I don't like reading. You ought to get that right with

554
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,980
the Lord, amen? Because it's God's Word to you, and He has preserved it for a

555
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,260
reason, and Paul says it was written for our admonition. The things that he

556
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,900
mentions in the text of Scripture are all events that took place with regard to

557
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,180
the children of Israel. I'm not going to deal with the particulars that are

558
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,020
given to us in verses 6-10, but I do want you to notice in verse number

559
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,059
5, notice what the Bible says,

560
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:19,980
"...but with many of them God was not well pleased." Now, he doesn't say, but with all

561
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,580
of them. He says, but with many of them. That means that there were some that

562
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,940
pleased the Lord, but there were some, many, that did not please the Lord, and it

563
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,220
says, "...for they were overthrown in the wilderness." He gives us the examples. In

564
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,580
fact, in verse number 6, it says, "...now these things were our examples." Now,

565
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,980
examples we are to learn from. We benefit from examples. We benefit from

566
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,260
reading these truths that are mentioned in the Old Testament from here in 1

567
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,300
Corinthians 10. We go back and we read them, and we learn from them, and if God

568
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,059
says that with many of them He was not well pleased, that ought to get my

569
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:01,460
attention, and ought to get your attention.

570
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,900
attention. Why? Well, because their behavior did not please God. And if their

571
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,900
behavior did not please God, then I better be careful that I'm not acting

572
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,700
and behaving in that way. Does that make sense this morning? If I find that the

573
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,140
Scriptures say that this is pleasing to the Lord, then I find, okay, that behavior

574
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,380
is pleasing to God. I ought to be doing that thing, whatever that is. So this is

575
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,380
that proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we're digging into the

576
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,900
Scriptures, that we're working, that we're proving, that we're finding. Okay, what is

577
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,240
it that was not pleasing? Well, we'll make one comment here. There was idolatry. We

578
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,620
understand idolatry is not pleasing to God, amen? It's a pretty simple one.

579
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,180
It's one that many times now John finishes 1st John by saying, my little

580
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,260
children, keep yourself from idols. Sometimes we're fooled in America to

581
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,620
think we don't have idols because we don't have little statues in our house

582
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,700
and we don't have these little wooden figurines and we don't bow down to them.

583
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,100
And so in America, we think we don't have idols. We have plenty of idols in

584
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:15,380
America. Plenty of idols in America. Work, money, sports. I mean, we could just go

585
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,800
status, position. I mean, you just go on and on. We got idols. The Bible says in

586
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,960
Colossians 1 that in all things He, Christ, must have the preeminence. Amen. He is

587
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,640
first. He is the one that has that place of preeminence. But we see idolatry is

588
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,920
mentioned, fornication is mentioned. Notice, if you will, just verse number 10.

589
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,880
It says, neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of

590
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,720
the destroyer. Now, what does it mean? We don't use the word murmur too often, but

591
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,600
I actually like the word murmur. It just sounds bad. You say to somebody, you're

592
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,720
murmuring. It almost could be offensive. But no, we just, we complain. We use that

593
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,500
word. It really means the same thing. You know, the children of Israel, they were

594
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,920
often guilty of complaining, of murmuring. And we find that the truth of God's Word

595
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:15,520
is that this is one of the things that are specifically mentioned here in 1

596
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,120
Corinthians chapter number 10 that did not please. He says, with many of them God

597
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,640
is not well pleased. One of the things that they were doing was murmuring. They

598
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,440
were complaining and God was not pleased with it. You know, we're good at

599
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
complaining. We really are. We're good at criticizing the children of Israel for

600
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,360
complaining. But then right after criticizing them for complaining, we

601
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,160
complain. Listen, people complain about it's too hot, it's too cold, it's too this,

602
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,560
it's too that. The food is too this, it's too that. This person asked for that. I

603
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,200
mean, we can find things to complain about and complain about and complain

604
00:32:50,200 --> 00:33:00,880
about. In Numbers chapter 21, the Bible says that the people spake against the

605
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,300
Lord and He sent fiery serpents. They were complaining about God's provision

606
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,320
for them. In that verse specifically, they were talking about the fact that they

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,360
hated manna. God miraculously provided manna. But in chapter number 11 of

608
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,120
Numbers, the Bible says, and when the people complained, it displeased the Lord

609
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,720
and the Lord heard it and His anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burned

610
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,240
among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. Now

611
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,520
Numbers 11.1 is a convicting verse of Scripture because the Bible says when

612
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,320
the people complained, it displeased the Lord. But then it tells us this, and the Lord

613
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,880
heard it. God hears our praise, but He also hears our complaints. And oh, would it be

614
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,720
said that He hears us praise Him far more frequently than He hears us

615
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,360
complaining. But not only did the Lord hear it, not only was the Lord displeased,

616
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,920
but the Bible says that His anger was kindled. His anger was kindled. I don't

617
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,800
want God to be angry with me. I don't want God to be angry with my family. I

618
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,040
don't want God to be angry with our church. I don't want to be complaining. No, I want to

619
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,920
learn from that example that is referenced in 1 Corinthians 10. We go

620
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
back to the Old Testament and we learn. So this truth of proving what is

621
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,880
acceptable unto the Lord. We can please God, but then how can I please the Lord?

622
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,880
The two vital principles, I need to dig into God's Word so that I can prove what

623
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,560
is acceptable unto the Lord. I need to understand that if I'm in the flesh, I'm

624
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:51,160
not going to please Him. Children are commanded to obey their parents. And in

625
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:57,880
Colossians 3.20, it says that in so doing, they are pleasing the Lord. So it's a

626
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,160
simple verse of Scripture, a simple principle that we find again as we're

627
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,240
studying and proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we find that God says

628
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,320
in Colossians 3.20, children obey your parents and all things for this is well

629
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:21,720
pleasing unto the Lord. And we find that we have children that disobey. They're

630
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,680
not just disobeying their parents, they're disobeying the Lord. They're not

631
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,760
just displeasing their parents, they're displeasing the Lord. And so we

632
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,680
find that again, going through this process of proving what is acceptable,

633
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,120
that helps us to understand not only that I can, but how can I please the Lord?

634
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,200
Let me give you three ways very quickly as we close this morning. Three ways that

635
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,280
we can please our Master. Three ways that we can please our Master. Number one,

636
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,200
living a life of faith. Living a life of faith. What does it mean to live by faith?

637
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,120
So often we use the terminology and it seems as if there are times in which we

638
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,880
talk about living by faith and it seems like this mystical kind of an idea

639
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,040
of what does it mean to live by faith? You hear people say, well, just step out

640
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,720
by faith. You ever heard somebody say that? And it's as if you're just

641
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,640
gonna step off into nothing and you're just stepping out by faith. And they use

642
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,600
that kind of, listen, it's not this mystical idea of living by faith. Living

643
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,760
by faith and living a life of faith is trusting God, is taking God at His word,

644
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:40,840
that what God says, God will do, that God always does what He says He will do, that

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,880
God is, as we sang this morning, a faithful God, that He's never failed, that

646
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,120
He never will fail, that He provides and He supplies the needs for His people. We

647
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,920
find that in Hebrews chapter number 11, a verse that I mentioned a moment ago, in

648
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,200
verse number 6, the Bible says, but without faith it is impossible to please

649
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,280
Him. So what do we learn from that? We learn that we better live by faith and

650
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,080
when we do it pleases God. You think about many instances in the Word of God

651
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,960
where people lived by faith, where people took God at His word, that they believed

652
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:25,160
that what God said, God will do, how God was pleased with them and how God did

653
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:32,200
the miraculous, that listen, as Noah stood, excuse me, as Moses stood on the

654
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,920
bank of the Red Sea and he believed God, that God said, raise up your arm with

655
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,680
that staff and that rod, that He would part the Red Sea, that as Moses

656
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,280
believed God and he acted in faith, he took God at His word, then God did the

657
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,720
rest. Because God always does what God says He will do. When Abraham went out,

658
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,640
not knowing whether he went, but he went out believing God, God says that it was

659
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,120
by faith that he went. You can read through Hebrews 11 and you can read of

660
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,600
all of these that that triumphed greatly through faith, but you'll understand

661
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,760
this vital principle that all of them simply took God at His word. We think

662
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,080
about Elijah when he prayed fire from heaven. What a great passage of Scripture.

663
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:29,320
The book of 1st Kings, we read it, we rejoice in seeing this great power of

664
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,679
God on display, but you'll notice something when when Elijah prays, he says

665
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:40,600
that I've said all this at thy word. It's a little phrase that gives us such

666
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:47,160
insight to what was happening there in that moment as Elijah was simply

667
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,640
believing God. He was acting in faith. And the Bible says that without faith it is

668
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,559
impossible to please Him, for he that cometh to God must believe that He is,

669
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:03,480
and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. And we find here

670
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,320
this truth, how do I live by faith? How do I walk by faith? How can I take God at

671
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,040
His word? Well, the Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the

672
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,679
word of the Lord, of the Word of God. Listen, your faith is not going to be

673
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,119
increased and you're not going to live by faith if you're not spending time in

674
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,080
this book, because faith comes, is produced by hearing the truth of God's

675
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Word. When we hear of all of the great triumphs of our God, when we hear of His

676
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,480
character, of His attributes, of who He is, of what He's capable of doing, it causes

677
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,200
me to have faith to believe. You think about the many miracles when the Lord

678
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,320
Jesus Christ walked upon the face of the earth, and how He would speak about,

679
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,040
thy faith hath made thee whole. I think about the man, Ronnie, often mentions the

680
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,640
individual that says, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief. It was believing that

681
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,640
God is able, that God was able, that He was able to do it.

682
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:10,640
will do, and when I read those truths of God's Word, when I'm saturating my mind and my heart

683
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,920
with who my God is and what my God has done, it increases my faith.

684
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,160
A question is asked that's a piercing question with regard to the return of the Lord.

685
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,520
Will he find faith on the earth?

686
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,120
I wonder.

687
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,600
We're to live by faith, not by sight, but by faith.

688
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,360
Well, I just need to be able to figure all this out, and I need to be able to see it

689
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
all before I...

690
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,680
That's not living by faith.

691
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,040
It's just believing God.

692
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,080
God said he would provide.

693
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,280
God said that he would bless.

694
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,920
God said that he would be who he says he will be, and we just believe him, and we live a

695
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,940
life that is marked by faith, that pleases the Lord.

696
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,320
God is pleased when we trust him, when we believe him.

697
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,360
Do you like people to believe you?

698
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,480
Sure you do.

699
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,560
We like people to believe us.

700
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,480
We like people to trust that what we say we will do, that we will do, that they can have

701
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,880
confidence.

702
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,480
God is pleased when we trust him, when we believe him, when we take God at his Word.

703
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,240
Paul stood up with great boldness and said in Acts 27, I believe God.

704
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,200
I believe God.

705
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,880
God gave him a great promise in that passage of Scripture, and he believed that God was

706
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
able.

707
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,380
Though the circumstances didn't look like it, he said, I believe God.

708
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,680
Notice number two.

709
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,600
Not only can we please God by living a life of faith, we live a life that's marked by

710
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
praise.

711
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,560
I mentioned about complaining a few moments ago that it displeased the Lord, but notice

712
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,820
that when we praise the Lord, that it pleases the Lord.

713
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,560
In Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, we started out this morning by reading a few verses of

714
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,900
Scripture from the book of Psalms and Psalm 34, and I made this statement that our God

715
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,540
is worthy of our praise.

716
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,760
He alone is worthy of our praise.

717
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,660
And we find here in Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, it says, by him, therefore, let us offer

718
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,700
the sacrifice of praise to God continually.

719
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,660
That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

720
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,940
I believe that God is pleased when we praise him, that God, he inhabits the praise of his

721
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,380
people.

722
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,380
We're to come before his throne with thanksgiving.

723
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,660
We're to enter into his gates with praise and with thanksgiving.

724
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,660
Why?

725
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:42,420
Because our God is worthy, and we're to offer continually to our God the fruit of our lips,

726
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,220
the giving thanks to his name.

727
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,140
And that in any situation, in any circumstance that you find yourself in in life, that God

728
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,020
is still on the throne and he's still good.

729
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,100
He is good all the time, and he is worthy of our praise.

730
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,300
In the most difficult of days, we can still lift our voice and praise the Lord.

731
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Why?

732
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
For he is.

733
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,580
He is.

734
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
He is holy.

735
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,580
He is just.

736
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,580
He is righteous.

737
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,780
He is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent.

738
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
He is almighty.

739
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,340
He is.

740
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
You keep filling in the blanks.

741
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
He is.

742
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
He's all those things and more.

743
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,860
When I learn to thank him for who he is and praise him for who he is, then my circumstances

744
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,700
don't matter so much because God is.

745
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,260
Paul and Silas, they were in prison.

746
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,140
They'd been beaten, but they sang praises unto God at midnight.

747
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,180
In the midst of that prison cell, in the midst of that difficulty, they knew that God was

748
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,580
still worthy of their praise.

749
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,220
A life that pleases the Lord, not only a life that's marked by faith, a life that's marked

750
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,980
by praise, but a life that's marked by giving, by giving to the Lord.

751
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,860
You know, so often when we approach the subject of giving, people get nervous and they get

752
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,700
worked up and they reach various conclusions, but understand that giving is part of the

753
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,860
Christian life.

754
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,680
We worship God through our giving.

755
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,940
We speak about that often.

756
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,980
We take up an offering.

757
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,940
It's not that somebody is trying to get, no, it's that we get to give to God.

758
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,640
We get to worship God.

759
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,380
We get to give to God.

760
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,340
Notice the book of Philippians, if you will, we're going to look at two passages very quickly

761
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,980
in the New Testament.

762
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,300
The children of Israel, by the way, had the privilege to give to the building of the tabernacle.

763
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,260
And as they gave, and the Bible regularly mentions, and we'll look at this in the book

764
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,820
of 2 Corinthians as well this morning, the Bible often mentions about willing offering,

765
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,220
willing.

766
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,420
And they gave so much that it was said, hey, the people bring too much, they don't need

767
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
to bring anymore.

768
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,020
Praise the Lord.

769
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,340
They were willing.

770
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,060
They were privileged to be able to give.

771
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,460
Notice in Philippians chapter four, in verse number 16, the Bible says, for even in Thessalonica

772
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,520
ye sent once again unto my necessity, not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit

773
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,460
that may abound to your account.

774
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,820
But I have all and abound, I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which

775
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,240
were sent from you.

776
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,680
And then notice how Paul describes the offering that was sent from these believers to him

777
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,880
for the work.

778
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:25,320
He says that it was an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

779
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,080
For some reason, there's been this stigma, if you will, with regard to speaking on the

780
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,760
subject of giving, that pastors shy away from it, that church people think the pastor's

781
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,360
just trying to get something, and the reality is that no, it's Bible.

782
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,360
It's Bible.

783
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,800
And God says that he is well-pleased when we give.

784
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:54,360
Listen, we're not just tipping God, we're giving to God out of a heart of love and obedience.

785
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,840
And God is pleased with it.

786
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:01,320
By the way, our giving not only pleases God, but it's also an evidence of our faith.

787
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,160
That we believe, if we just start with the tithe and just mention the tithe for just

788
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:12,040
a moment, that we believe that God will do with 90 percent more than what could be done

789
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,400
with 100 percent.

790
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,440
It's believing God.

791
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,480
It's just taking God at his word.

792
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,600
That God said that you've robbed me in the book of Malachi, where have we robbed thee?

793
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,000
In tithes and offerings.

794
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,200
And he said that prove me is what he said in Malachi chapter 3.

795
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
And what would he do?

796
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,360
Not only would he bless them, but he would also rebuke the devourer for their sakes.

797
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,720
Our God is able, and it's a matter of faith, it's a matter of obedience, but it's pleasing

798
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
to the Lord.

799
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Notice the people in 2 Corinthians chapter 9, and I have to hurry here, 2 Corinthians

800
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:57,960
chapter 9, in verses 6 and 7, the Bible says this, in 2 Corinthians 9, it's interesting

801
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,880
if you, I don't have time, but if you want to go back later this afternoon and read chapter

802
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,560
8, you'll notice that the very people that he's speaking of in chapter 9 that we're giving,

803
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,160
that they were in deep poverty, but yet they gave.

804
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,720
And he says this, that they first gave of them their own selves to the Lord, and then

805
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,180
of their substance.

806
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,320
But notice in 2 Corinthians 9 in verse 6, the Bible says, but this I say, he which soweth

807
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,320
sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

808
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,240
Now we understand this from a perspective of agriculture, do we not?

809
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,180
If you plant a bunch of seeds, you're going to expect to have a big crop.

810
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,440
If you plant just a few seeds, you're going to expect to have a smaller crop.

811
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,580
You're not going to plant a few seeds and think that you're going to have an abundance

812
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,740
of crop, right?

813
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,820
We understand agriculturally, but he's making the application here to our giving, whether

814
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,560
we're giving sparingly or whether we're giving bountifully.

815
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:03,180
Notice in verse number 7, every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give.

816
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:13,060
But notice what it says, not grudgingly or of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful giver.

817
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,140
It's a wonderful truth that we find here.

818
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,620
We mentioned in Philippians chapter number 4 that God is well pleased with this, with

819
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,620
our giving.

820
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,540
But here in 2 Corinthians 9, the Bible says that God loveth a cheerful giver, that the

821
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,540
perspective is not this that I'm giving grudgingly or of necessity.

822
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,840
It's not that I have to, it's that I get to.

823
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:38,619
It's that God blessed me and God has enabled me to give back to him.

824
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,179
God is pleased with that.

825
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:41,179
Why?

826
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:47,340
Because we're honoring him, we're exalting him, and he's pleased.

827
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:54,179
This morning we've answered the question that yes, indeed, I can please God.

828
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,739
And then we've considered some ways in which we are able to please him.

829
00:48:58,739 --> 00:48:59,739
How can I do it?

830
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:02,619
Okay, I understand that I can, but then how?

831
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:08,260
You continue to apply the principle of Ephesians 5, 10 to your life and prove what is acceptable

832
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,619
unto the Lord, and you'll find a number of reasons.

833
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,020
I've given you three simple thoughts this morning on how we can please God, but understand

834
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:21,820
the Bible is full of examples of how your behavior and my behavior can please our God,

835
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:27,299
and that we would have this idea, we'd have this perspective that we find in 2 Timothy

836
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:33,580
2 and verse number 4, that I want to please my master, a good soldier.

837
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,140
Not only does he endure hardness, not only does he avoid distraction, but he has as a

838
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,020
goal to please his master.

839
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,780
This morning as we examine our lives, I hope that we would examine our lives in such a

840
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,619
way that we would determine whether our behavior pleases the Lord.

841
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:53,420
Are there adjustments that need to be made?

842
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,420
Are there areas in our life where, if we're honest and if we're humble, as the Holy Spirit

843
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,179
of God searches and proves, that would say, you know, there's some areas that are not

844
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:03,700
really well.

845
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,180
well-pleasing to the Lord, then make the adjustments.

846
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,580
There's some things that need to be adjusted.

847
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,860
I made this statement on Wednesday evening.

848
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,860
It's a silly thing for us to go to the truth of God's word

849
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,300
and to be confronted with truth

850
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:23,460
and then to not apply it, to not make adjustments,

851
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,540
to not say, you know what, that's something that I need,

852
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,500
that's something I need to incorporate in my life.

853
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,820
No, we come to the place where we say,

854
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,860
listen, I want God to be pleased with my life,

855
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,940
and if adjustments are necessary,

856
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,260
then by God's grace and with God's help,

857
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,180
I'll make the adjustments so that my life can be pleasing

858
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,740
so that we could have the testimony of Enoch.

859
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,420
He pleased the Lord.

860
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,020
He pleased God.

861
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:52,840
Let's pray together.

862
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,680
Father, we love you.

863
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,020
We thank you for loving us.

864
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,560
Lord, this morning, the challenge is simple.

865
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Are we living in a manner that pleases you?

866
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,240
We acknowledge that our behavior can please you

867
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,160
and our behavior can displease you.

868
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,720
We've looked at three simple thoughts.

869
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,760
The Bible is full of examples.

870
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,600
The list is by no way, no means exhaustive.

871
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,360
Your word has plenty of examples for us.

872
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,720
And I pray that you'd help each of us to have as our goal

873
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,280
that we want to be a good soldier

874
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,320
and that a good soldier has as a goal to please his master.

875
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,260
And I pray that you'd help us this morning

876
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,680
to live our lives in such a way that you'd be pleased.

877
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,680
Help us to examine.

878
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,280
Help us to adjust.

879
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,440
There's some things that we're doing

880
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,780
that are not pleasing your sight.

881
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,320
Would you help us to confess them and forsake them?

882
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,360
There's things that we're not doing that we should be doing.

883
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,640
Lord, help us to be obedient.

884
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,000
Help us to be doers of the word.

885
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Help us, Lord, to live a life

886
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,000
that is well-pleasing in thy sight.

887
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,480
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

888
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,840
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

889
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,680
Would you stand with me?

890
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,500
Heads are bowed.
