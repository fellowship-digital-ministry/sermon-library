WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
to 2 Timothy chapter number two.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.880
And we've been dealing with this series

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.899
throughout the calendar year of 2024 of continue.

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.779
It's our theme for this year.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.760
And as Pierre mentioned,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.800
it's October is right around the corner

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.360
and it's hard to believe we're nearing the end.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.879
And I've mapped out,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.520
not completed each message for the rest of the year,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.540
but every time around September and October,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.200
I have to map out to make sure

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm gonna have enough Sundays to finish up

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.259
what it is that we're going to have for our theme.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.220
And so I'm excited about what God has in store for us

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.459
and praying about a theme for next year.

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:41.659
And my target date typically is October 1st

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.659
to have all of that ready to roll.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.380
And so you pray that God will give wisdom and direction,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
but I'm thankful for this series,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779
first and second Timothy, the thought of continue.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.340
No doubt we live as we come to the third chapter

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880
in a few weeks in a time of being the last days,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.959
perilous times as they are described for us.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.659
And we see all kinds of things going on in our world

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.300
and turmoil and so on and so forth,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.099
but we serve a God who is on his throne,

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.300
who has a plan, who do with all things well,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.419
his way is perfect, amen.

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:17.360
And I am thankful to know him as my personal Lord and Savior

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.699
and thankful for the opportunity

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:23.099
that we have to serve him as soldiers in the Lord's army.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.360
When you trust at Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.519
you were enlisted in the Lord's army

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.919
and praise the Lord for that truth.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.980
And we find that God gives us in this passage

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.440
in second Timothy chapter number two,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.720
really the entirety of the chapter,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.360
much information with regard to being not only a soldier

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.239
in the Lord's army, but a good soldier.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.319
And that's been the thought for a few weeks now

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.440
here on Sunday mornings.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.440
I'm not content.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.680
I don't wanna be content.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:54.739
I don't want you to be content with just simply saying,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.580
I'm a soldier in the Lord's army.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.699
No, I wanna be a good soldier.

00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:00.959
We find that within the text of scripture,

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.099
there are five characteristics that God gives us

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.980
that would cause a soldier to be referred to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.380
as being a good soldier.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.419
And we see that in verse number three,

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.979
thou therefore endure hardness

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.179
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.300
The Christian life is a spiritual warfare.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.559
We find that the battle is raging

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.259
and too many soldiers in the Lord's army

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.679
are ill prepared for the battle.

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.860
And that's just the reality.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.080
That's just the way it is.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.479
And it's unfortunate, but it's the truth.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.360
And we must preach the truth.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.399
We must analyze and be able to examine

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:44.039
and to honestly evaluate where we are individually

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.639
and where we are as a church locally,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.619
but then also the body of Christ broadly speaking.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.539
It seems as if I made this comment to someone yesterday

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:55.899
when we were going apple picking,

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.660
but it seems as if some in our society today

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.320
that are saved by the grace of God,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.660
they're enlisted in the army of the Lord's army

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.740
that they enjoy being a soldier,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.300
but simply want no part of combat.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.300
Now think about that just for a moment.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.880
They're happy to be a soldier.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.059
They're happy that they're saved.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.339
They're happy that they're going to heaven,

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.259
but they really don't want any part of combat.

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.000
They don't want to be engaged in the battle.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.119
They don't want to be in the spiritual warfare,

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.199
but we understand that Paul says to the believers

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.720
in Ephesus in Ephesians six,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.199
that we're to be strong in the Lord

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.520
and the power of his might.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.600
He says in verse number 12,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.639
that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.479
but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.880
And we see that we understand I've made known for years now

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.320
when we look at our society

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.919
and we look at the problems and all that's taking place.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.660
Many people try to say that we're dealing with cultural war.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.479
We're dealing with this social war, so on and so forth,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.220
but really we're dealing with spiritual warfare.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.119
It takes on many shapes and forms.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.860
It's called a number of different things,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.899
but we understand as Bible believers

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.580
that it is a fight between evil and good.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.820
And we understand that it's a spiritual battle.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.479
We must come into the spiritual battle

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.539
prepared for combat, being strong in the Lord.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.640
And we find that as we have that desire

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.119
that we would be a good soldier of Jesus Christ

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:24.160
refusing to be content with average.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.279
You know, there are a lot of people today

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.160
that are just okay with status quo,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.160
just kind of, I'm getting by, I'm making it, I'm average.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.640
And I hope that that would not be our place

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.920
of being content there,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.640
but that we would strive for excellence

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.040
in the Christian life,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.339
that we would strive to be in a place

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:47.200
where God would be pleased with us,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.220
that we would honor and glorify him,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.700
that truly it would be said of each and every one of us,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.820
not only that we're a soldier,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.459
but we're a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.019
We looked at in the first lesson

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.260
that a good soldier endures hardness.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.940
We noticed that in verse number three.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.059
I read it a moment ago,

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:06.880
thou therefore endure hardness

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.959
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.339
Two weeks ago, we dealt with the first part

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.600
of verse number four,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.420
that a good soldier avoids distractions.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.260
The Bible says, no man that woreth

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.299
and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life.

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:24.739
The distractions will vary.

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.380
The distractions are abundant,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.619
but we know that our enemy, he is a master deceiver,

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.179
and he distracts us in so many ways.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:34.940
There's so many distractions around us,

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.459
and we must be focused on the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:41.760
and on the work that he has for us

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.880
because we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.059
We can no longer afford to be distracted.

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.640
We can't be, as I said two weeks ago, asleep at the wheel.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640
We must be alert.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.040
We must be vigilant.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.160
Remember what the Bible says

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.679
in 1 Peter chapter number five, in verse number 80,

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:00.399
it says, be sober, be vigilant.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.279
Why?

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.119
Because your adversary,

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:06.000
we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.040
as a roaring lion walketh about,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.059
seeking whom he may devour.

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:14.279
He wants to destroy your life.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.660
He wants to devour you.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.140
Here's what I'm thankful for.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.140
He has no power over me with regard to going to heaven.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.779
He can't take my salvation.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.179
Hallelujah.

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:27.839
I am kept in the hand of God, amen.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.420
But you know, he wants to destroy our lives.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.339
He wants to destroy our testimonies.

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.140
He wants to destroy our effectiveness.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.660
He wants to devour you, your spouse, your children.

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.480
He wants to devour.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.279
And so we find that the Bible says, be sober, be vigilant.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.200
And we find here that this soldier, this good soldier,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.679
number one, he endures hardness.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.320
Number two, he avoids distractions.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.799
This morning, we'll look at the remainder

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:53.760
of verse number four.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.059
The Bible says that he, that good soldier

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:58.920
that's referenced in verse number three,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.179
that he may please him.

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:02.019
Who's him?

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.679
Well, that's the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.660
That is our savior who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.140
Again, when you got saved by the grace of God,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.679
you were enlisted in the Lord's army.

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:15.700
You didn't get saved and then make a decision.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.980
You know, do I want to sign up

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.600
to be in the Lord's army or not?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.980
And you know, I'm gonna evaluate.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.820
No, no, when you got saved, whether you knew it or not,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.320
now you do, you were enlisted in the Lord's army.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.339
That's his plan.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.380
He hath chosen you to be a soldier.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.579
And notice the Bible says that he, that soldier,

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:37.880
that good soldier may please him, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.440
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.040
So this morning, as we note the third characteristic

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.559
of a good soldier, I would say this,

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:49.799
they seek to please their master.

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:53.799
A good soldier seeks to please their master.

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:56.239
I made the statement on Wednesday evening,

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.959
too many people that are saved,

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:02.739
they are interested in having a savior,

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:04.920
but not a Lord or a master.

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:07.579
They want a savior.

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:09.579
They want to go to heaven when they die,

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.779
but they really don't want a master.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:16.339
They don't want Jesus to be Lord of their lives.

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:17.380
What do I mean by that?

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.299
Well, they want to just do what pleases them.

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:20.420
They want to live their life.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.260
They want the benefit of heaven, so to speak,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.940
but they want to do whatever it is

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.500
that they want to do here on this side of eternity.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.119
They want to live to please themselves.

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.960
We all know people that are living to please themselves.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.520
We know, by the way, where that ends.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.039
We know the futility of it.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.200
We know that it brings no real true peace and joy,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.479
that it's empty, it's vain, but we find this morning

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:47.320
that the good soldier, he is going to seek

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.200
to please his master, understanding

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.340
that not only is Jesus my savior,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.880
but he is my Lord and my master.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.219
By the way, he's a good Lord.

00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:58.099
He's a good master.

00:08:58.099 --> 00:09:01.080
His commandments are not grievous, amen?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.940
Some people look and they try to attack the scripture

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.799
and they say, well, you know, the Christian life

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.979
is just a whole list of do's and don'ts.

00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:10.640
If you look at it that way, you have missed

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.679
the whole point of the relationship

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.320
that you have with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.059
and are there things that he tells us not to do?

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.299
Sure.

00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:21.099
Are there things that he tells us that we should do?

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:23.539
Absolutely, but if you have children,

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:25.580
you have a list of things that they should do

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.000
and they should not do.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.840
Why?

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.320
Because you love them.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.840
Because you love them.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.320
And God as our Lord and our master and our savior,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.679
he's given to us in his word truth

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:40.679
that helps us understand how we can please him.

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.039
Note this, you don't need to turn there.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.080
I'm gonna read the verse for you,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.760
but in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number four,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.700
the apostle Paul is writing to this church

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.000
that he had the privilege of going

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.440
and preaching the gospel to.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.940
He says, but as we were allowed of God

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.400
to be put in trust with the gospel,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.880
even so we speak.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.840
Notice where he says, not as pleasing men.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.180
but God, which trieth our hearts.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.140
It ought to be the desire of every child of God.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.700
It ought to be the desire of every saved,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.700
blood-bought child of God to please their master.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.220
We find that a good soldier, according to verse number four,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.940
it says that he may please him

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.540
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.820
Let me ask you, I'm gonna ask two questions this morning

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.540
as we deal with the subject matter.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.060
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.060
can I, can you, can we please the Lord?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.140
You ever found yourself in a situation

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.280
where you found like, or you felt like

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.020
you found yourself in a situation

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.620
where you had a desire to please

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.980
maybe an employer or somebody else,

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.060
but you found yourself, I don't know how,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.740
I feel like I cannot please this person.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.780
It seems like everything I do is wrong.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.460
You ever been there, you feel that way?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.940
And I'm sure that at some point in life,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.020
a teacher, a professor, a coworker, an employer,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.420
whoever it might be, that we have felt that way,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.560
but we find that we come to the scriptures

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.340
and we come to the truth that is before us this morning,

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.800
we can rejoice in knowing that I can please the Lord.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.380
You can live your life, I can live my life,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.620
we can live our lives in such a way

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.460
that the Lord Jesus Christ would be pleased with us.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.100
And by the way, he's revealed to us in his word,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.560
we'll deal with that in just a moment,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.700
but we wanna answer the question, can I?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.660
There's some people that go through life and they say,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.620
well, I can't please God anyway.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.460
Well, you can please God.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.580
And it is absolutely possible,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.700
we see it in 1 Thessalonians 2,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.920
where Paul says that he's seeking to please God,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.340
not pleasing men, but pleasing God.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.340
If the apostle Paul understood that he was able to serve

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.100
in such a way that he could bring honor and glory

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.580
to his savior to please his Lord,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.820
then we understand this morning

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.100
that we too can please the Lord.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.800
In 1 Thessalonians 4, in fact, turn over there if you will,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.900
we find that Paul gave his testimony in the second chapter

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.140
with regard to his entrance into and how he recognized

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.060
that he had been privileged to preach the gospel,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.060
but he was seeking in doing so to please God

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.820
because he understood that that was pleasing in his sight.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.620
But notice as he's writing in chapter number four

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.900
to these believers, these in Thessalonica,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.020
he's encouraging them with regard that they too

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.300
can please the Lord with their lives.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.420
In verse number one of 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.400
the Bible says, furthermore then,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.440
we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.540
that as ye have received of us,

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.860
notice how ye ought to walk and to please God,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.420
so ye would abound more and more,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.420
for ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.300
And so as Paul is writing here

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.540
to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.700
not only did he tell them in the second chapter

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.140
that he was living and behaving in such a way

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.360
that he would please God, not men,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.740
that he would please God,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.100
that then he tells these believers

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.280
that they have received truth.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.640
He mentions that truth in verse number two

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.800
as being the commandments that they gave Paul

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.120
to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.600
notice, by the Lord Jesus.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.400
These weren't commands that just Paul was making up

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.220
and adding these things.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.960
No, Paul was giving the commands

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.400
as the Lord had given the commands.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.120
And he says this, that you've received them.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.240
Well, you've received, you've been instructed

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.240
on how ye ought to walk, and then notice the phrase,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.720
and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.920
And so we find that the Apostle Paul

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.000
is saying to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.560
listen, you can please God with your life.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.020
And I've given you the instruction, God has enabled me,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.580
God has allowed me to be the individual,

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.460
the mouthpiece, if you will,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.160
that brought this truth to you

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.240
so that you would know how you can please the Lord.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.000
And then he ends it by saying this,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.540
so you would abound more and more.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.600
Live your life to please the Lord, why?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.060
Because it's possible.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.640
Notice the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you will,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.560
in John chapter number eight.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.560
Turn back, if you will, to John chapter number eight.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.600
Now, we know that Jesus is God in flesh,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.040
and what a blessing to understand that command

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.720
or that truth, and we find that Jesus, as God,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.360
he left his throne in heaven,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.280
he came to this sin-cursed world,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.840
he lived a perfect, sinless life,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.840
and he went to the cruel cross so that we could be saved.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.240
And what a joy that is to know.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.800
But he makes this statement in John chapter number eight,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.480
and what a great truth.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.920
The Bible says, and he that sent me is with me,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.680
the Father hath not left me alone,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.680
for I do always those things that please him.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.600
I want you to think about your life,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.360
and I want you to examine, as I have,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.320
and I wonder today, now obviously we understand

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.840
that Jesus is God, he's perfect, and we are not,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.760
but I wonder if we would evaluate our lives,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.120
I know that we could not say that I do always

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.920
those things that please the Lord,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.120
because we are sinners and we fail,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.000
but I wonder if there's more things that we do in our life

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.400
that please him than not.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.240
If we truly evaluate our lives,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.760
if we look at our last days that we've walked on this earth,

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.720
as we look at the last few days,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.320
did I please the Lord with how I walked?

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.120
Did I please the Lord with the things that I said?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.200
Did I please the Lord?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.800
Because I can please God, I can please him.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.720
And Jesus says, I do always those things that please him.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.960
There's a man in the Old Testament,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.760
we'll look at the testimony of this man

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.240
in the book of Hebrews, in the 11th chapter,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.800
if you'd turn there just for a moment,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.720
Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.160
We think about this great hall of faith chapter

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.120
and how God has given to us the testimonies

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.320
of those that live by faith.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.960
And by the way, the Bible tells us

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.920
the just shall live by faith.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.540
We are to take God at his word, to believe him,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.380
God is pleased when we live a life of faith,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.400
and we'll mention that in just a few moments,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.320
but look here, in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.640
in verse number five, God tells us about a man

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.360
by the name of Enoch.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.160
And the Bible says that Enoch in verse number five,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.160
by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.280
Notice and was not found because God had translated him

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.600
for before his translation, he had this testimony

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.200
that he pleased God, that he pleased God.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.320
Isn't that a simple testimony, but so powerful.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.040
I mean, it's just a simple statement.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.040
Enoch pleased God, praise the Lord, that he pleased God.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.120
He lived in such a way, and by the way,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.840
we understand historically, if you were to go back

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.360
to Genesis five, just on the eve of Genesis six

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.920
and the great global flood and all that would take place.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.900
And obviously the Bible tells us that Noah found grace

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.860
in the eyes of the Lord, but the reality is

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.660
that he was living, Noah was, during a time

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.660
of great wickedness, and Noah was able to walk with God

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.660
and please God and find grace in the sight of God.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.860
But so was Enoch as we look in the fifth chapter,

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.860
again, all of those things of wickedness

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.980
that were going on, and Enoch had this testimony

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.420
that he pleased God.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.700
Now understand this isn't Enoch writing about himself.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.060
This is God writing about Enoch.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.780
And I wonder today if God were to write about your life,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.180
if he were to write about my life,

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.060
if he would sum up our testimony in the same way.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.660
They pleased me.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.260
They lived in such a way that they, see because we can.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.820
We can please God.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.980
We can please him with our lives.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.420
The record that we see in these few verses of scripture

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.420
answer the question with great certainty

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.780
that absolutely we can live in such a way

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.140
that God is pleased.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.900
If it's true that we can live in such a way

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.380
that God is pleased, it's also true

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.300
that we can live in such a way that God is not pleased.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.460
Amen.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.059
And our behavior matters to God.

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:53.940
There are some people that have the idea, antinomianism,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.180
if you've heard about the subject, the terminology,

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.580
they believe, they teach that you're saved by grace,

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.380
you can kind of just live however you want to live,

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.380
and you're just gonna go to heaven when you die.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.540
And the reality is that I'm thankful

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.260
that salvation is eternally secure,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.300
that I can't work for my salvation,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.180
nor can I work to keep my salvation.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.740
But the Bible does tell us that if any man be in Christ,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.540
he is a new creature, old things are passed away,

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.540
behold, all things become new.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.700
The Bible tells us that we are his workmanship

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.280
created in Christ Jesus unto good works.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.140
We find that the Bible tells us as James deals with it,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.059
and he deals with the fruit of salvation,

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:33.140
not so much as Paul deals with the root of salvation.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.940
He says, you say that you have faith, show me your works.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.380
Your works prove your faith.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.340
And we understand that to be true.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.100
James is not complicating the situation

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.260
and expressing that there's some way

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.180
that you can be saved by your works.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.100
No, he's simply saying that if you are saved,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.740
it will be evidenced in how you live, amen.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.340
And we find this morning that if we,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:05.460
understand that God has saved us, if we have that goal and that desire, that we

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:12.540
would please Him who has chosen us to be a soldier, that we would desire to please

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.660
Him, but understanding this morning that I can. It is a goal that can be

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.300
achieved. There are times in life where you might think, well, I've set these

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.420
goals and these goals are just not attainable. And oftentimes in the

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.300
beginning of a calendar year, I'll challenge people about setting spiritual

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.220
goals for the upcoming year and dealing with various things with regard to Bible

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.940
reading and prayer time and witnessing opportunities and so on and so forth. And

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.140
why? Because we want to have, if you don't have a goal, you just just go through

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.340
life aimlessly, helplessly, hopelessly. You just, you just have, you're just no

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.100
direction. But set some goals. I've encouraged people this way. Listen, don't

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.220
set your goal to read the Bible for three hours a day if you're not reading

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.500
it for three minutes a day right now. Why? It's just not attainable. It's not

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.380
realistic. If you're reading your Bible for two hours and 30 minutes a day right

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.020
now and you say, you know what, I want to read it for three hours a day, praise the

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.620
Lord. It's a, it's an attainable, it's a, it's a goal that is possible. This truth

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:26.140
that is before us this morning, I'm thankful that we can please God. And it's

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.980
not a moving target. It's not something that's just like, oh, I don't know what to

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.860
do. I don't know how to do. Is it even possible? Yes, it's possible. And we answer

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.700
the question, can I? And now we answer the question number two, how can I please

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:47.660
God? It's important that we understand that we can, but then we get to the, to

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:53.420
the nuts and bolts, if you will, of how can I? I understand that I'm, I can, but

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.060
now how do I do it? Well, there's two important principles that I'd like to

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.780
consider and then kind of jump into some thoughts, practical application, if you

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.660
will. And the first one is a truth that we find in Romans chapter number eight.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.220
Look in Romans chapter number eight, if you will. Now understand that as we got

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.660
saved, that, that our spirit, we were made alive. We were quickened. Ephesians

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.060
two talks about those of us that were dead, that we were quickened, we were made

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.460
alive. And at the moment of salvation, Galatians describes it this way, that,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.260
that there's this battle between our flesh and our spirit. The Bible says that

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.700
they're at enmity, one against the other. And we understand the great promise of

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.740
Galatians five, that if we walk in the spirit, we shall not fulfill the lust of

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:47.580
the flesh. It'd be wonderful from a human perspective, but we understand and we

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.340
submit ourselves to the plan of God. We, sometimes we say, man, I wish that we

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.900
just didn't have this flesh anymore. But at the moment of salvation, it was just

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.580
eradicated. And I understand the positive idea of that, but that's not how God

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:06.740
chose it to be. And we still have the flesh with the carnal desires and the lust

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.100
of the flesh is still there, but the Bible says that if I walk in the spirit,

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.660
I will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. He gives me power. He gives me victory.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.220
And we understand that. And so when we look at the truth that's before us in

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.940
Romans chapter number eight, I want you to consider this vital principle as we

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.900
seek to answer the question, how can I please the Lord? Understanding that I can,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:36.420
but now how? Notice verse number eight, so then they that are in the flesh, notice

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:43.980
what it says, can not please God. Now, do you know what it is when you're in the

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:51.340
flesh? I'm asking, do you know as a Christian, as a child of God that's been

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:57.100
saved for a period of time, do you know in your life personally what it is when

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.300
you're in the flesh? Can you feel it? Can you understand the feeling that you get

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:07.140
when you're like, I'm in the flesh right now? And sometimes you say, I want to be

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.380
in the flesh for a minute right now. No, you should stop right there and you

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.260
should pray and you should confess and you should, but we're all humans. I'm just

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.260
I'm trying to be helpful this morning because we all deal with the flesh and

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.620
you let somebody say something to you, do something to you, and all of a sudden you

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:29.580
can, that old man can revive in a moment. Yes, the principle is true that we're to

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.780
put off and put on, put off the old man, put on the new, and what great truth we

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.980
find in Ephesians and Colossians with regard to doing that. But you understand

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.460
that Paul said, I am crucified with Christ and I die daily, and even if you

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.420
do that, in a moment's time that old man can be revived. And you can be in the

00:24:50.420 --> 00:25:00.580
flesh in a hurry. Am I right? And the Bible says in Romans 8 and verse number 8,

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:12.460
that if we're in the flesh, we can not please God. We cannot please God. So we

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.980
ought not walk in the flesh. We ought not walk according to the former lusts and

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.860
desires. We need to walk in the Spirit. It's an important principle that we

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.460
understand as we seek to answer the question, how can I please the Lord? I

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:33.420
understand that I can, but then how can I? We must recognize that if we're in the

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.700
flesh, we're not going to be able to please God. We're not going to be. Why?

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:42.500
There's a great contrast. It's amazing, in verse number 6, if you look at just a

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.860
few verses up, it says, for to be carnally minded is death, but to be

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.140
spiritually minded is life and peace. There's a great contrast that we find. We

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.980
mentioned in Hebrews 11 and verse number 5, the testimony of Enoch, but verse

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.540
number 6 says that without faith it is impossible to please Him, for they that

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.020
believe, they that come to God must believe that He is and that He's a

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.140
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. And so we find here that this idea

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.980
of walking in the flesh, and we know what it is, we've experienced it, and we know,

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.500
and we know the fact that they're at enmity, the flesh and the spirit, one

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.540
against the other, but we must understand this morning that if we're going to live

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.740
in the flesh, if we're going to mind the things of the flesh, we're not going to

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.580
please God. He's not going to be pleased with our lives. The second important

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.180
principle is found in Ephesians chapter 5. Notice with me in Ephesians chapter

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:38.260
number 5, and it's an important truth that is a simple verse of Scripture that

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:45.020
gives us great work to do. Why do I say that? Well Ephesians 5 in verse number

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:54.260
10 says, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. That word acceptable is also

00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:00.100
translated in our Bibles as well-pleasing. So we find that what is

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.580
acceptable to the Lord is pleasing to the Lord, and we find here that it says

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.700
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. What does it mean to prove something? What

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.940
is the process that's being done here? There's this process of proving. It was

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:21.100
often used in metalworking, and getting an element, silver was very common.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.020
They would go through that process of purifying the silver. They're proving it.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:30.300
They're getting out all of the things that need to be taken out and

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.580
withdrawn, and they're purifying, and here we say proving. It's that work, and

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.940
we dig into the Scriptures, and we're seeking to prove what is acceptable unto

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.860
the Lord. What is well-pleasing to God? Well in our journey of doing this, as we

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.900
have the opportunity to go through and to study the Scriptures, we have many

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:57.060
examples that God has given us with regard to things that please Him and

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.300
things that do not please Him. In fact, there's a great example of something

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.380
that does not please Him. We mentioned already in Romans 8 about walking in the

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.900
flesh, but notice, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10. In 1

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:15.620
Corinthians chapter number 10, the Bible tells us, as God is using Paul to

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.460
minister to these believers in Corinth, and he's going back to the Old Testament

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.020
and says, in fact, in the text of Scripture that the things that were

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.860
written aforetime are written for our admonition. I'm so thankful that God

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.059
chose to preserve the Old Testament. The Old Testament, listen, all Scripture is

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:38.780
given by inspiration of God. That means from Genesis 1-1 to Revelation 22-21, amen?

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:45.500
All of it is inspired by God, and it is profitable. So I don't, a certain

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.180
portion of the Scripture, I don't like reading. You ought to get that right with

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.980
the Lord, amen? Because it's God's Word to you, and He has preserved it for a

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.260
reason, and Paul says it was written for our admonition. The things that he

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.900
mentions in the text of Scripture are all events that took place with regard to

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.180
the children of Israel. I'm not going to deal with the particulars that are

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.020
given to us in verses 6-10, but I do want you to notice in verse number

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.059
5, notice what the Bible says,

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:19.980
"...but with many of them God was not well pleased." Now, he doesn't say, but with all

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.580
of them. He says, but with many of them. That means that there were some that

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.940
pleased the Lord, but there were some, many, that did not please the Lord, and it

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.220
says, "...for they were overthrown in the wilderness." He gives us the examples. In

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.580
fact, in verse number 6, it says, "...now these things were our examples." Now,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:44.980
examples we are to learn from. We benefit from examples. We benefit from

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.260
reading these truths that are mentioned in the Old Testament from here in 1

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.300
Corinthians 10. We go back and we read them, and we learn from them, and if God

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.059
says that with many of them He was not well pleased, that ought to get my

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:01.460
attention, and ought to get your attention.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:06.900
attention. Why? Well, because their behavior did not please God. And if their

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.900
behavior did not please God, then I better be careful that I'm not acting

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.700
and behaving in that way. Does that make sense this morning? If I find that the

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:22.140
Scriptures say that this is pleasing to the Lord, then I find, okay, that behavior

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.380
is pleasing to God. I ought to be doing that thing, whatever that is. So this is

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.380
that proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we're digging into the

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.900
Scriptures, that we're working, that we're proving, that we're finding. Okay, what is

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:42.240
it that was not pleasing? Well, we'll make one comment here. There was idolatry. We

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.620
understand idolatry is not pleasing to God, amen? It's a pretty simple one.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.180
It's one that many times now John finishes 1st John by saying, my little

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.260
children, keep yourself from idols. Sometimes we're fooled in America to

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.620
think we don't have idols because we don't have little statues in our house

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.700
and we don't have these little wooden figurines and we don't bow down to them.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.100
And so in America, we think we don't have idols. We have plenty of idols in

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:15.380
America. Plenty of idols in America. Work, money, sports. I mean, we could just go

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.800
status, position. I mean, you just go on and on. We got idols. The Bible says in

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.960
Colossians 1 that in all things He, Christ, must have the preeminence. Amen. He is

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.640
first. He is the one that has that place of preeminence. But we see idolatry is

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.920
mentioned, fornication is mentioned. Notice, if you will, just verse number 10.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:42.880
It says, neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.720
the destroyer. Now, what does it mean? We don't use the word murmur too often, but

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.600
I actually like the word murmur. It just sounds bad. You say to somebody, you're

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:58.720
murmuring. It almost could be offensive. But no, we just, we complain. We use that

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.500
word. It really means the same thing. You know, the children of Israel, they were

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.920
often guilty of complaining, of murmuring. And we find that the truth of God's Word

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:15.520
is that this is one of the things that are specifically mentioned here in 1

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.120
Corinthians chapter number 10 that did not please. He says, with many of them God

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.640
is not well pleased. One of the things that they were doing was murmuring. They

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.440
were complaining and God was not pleased with it. You know, we're good at

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.080
complaining. We really are. We're good at criticizing the children of Israel for

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.360
complaining. But then right after criticizing them for complaining, we

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.160
complain. Listen, people complain about it's too hot, it's too cold, it's too this,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.560
it's too that. The food is too this, it's too that. This person asked for that. I

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.200
mean, we can find things to complain about and complain about and complain

00:32:50.200 --> 00:33:00.880
about. In Numbers chapter 21, the Bible says that the people spake against the

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.300
Lord and He sent fiery serpents. They were complaining about God's provision

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.320
for them. In that verse specifically, they were talking about the fact that they

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.360
hated manna. God miraculously provided manna. But in chapter number 11 of

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.120
Numbers, the Bible says, and when the people complained, it displeased the Lord

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.720
and the Lord heard it and His anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burned

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:33.240
among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. Now

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:39.520
Numbers 11.1 is a convicting verse of Scripture because the Bible says when

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:46.320
the people complained, it displeased the Lord. But then it tells us this, and the Lord

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:54.880
heard it. God hears our praise, but He also hears our complaints. And oh, would it be

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.720
said that He hears us praise Him far more frequently than He hears us

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:04.360
complaining. But not only did the Lord hear it, not only was the Lord displeased,

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:10.920
but the Bible says that His anger was kindled. His anger was kindled. I don't

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.800
want God to be angry with me. I don't want God to be angry with my family. I

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.040
don't want God to be angry with our church. I don't want to be complaining. No, I want to

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.920
learn from that example that is referenced in 1 Corinthians 10. We go

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.920
back to the Old Testament and we learn. So this truth of proving what is

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.880
acceptable unto the Lord. We can please God, but then how can I please the Lord?

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.880
The two vital principles, I need to dig into God's Word so that I can prove what

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.560
is acceptable unto the Lord. I need to understand that if I'm in the flesh, I'm

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:51.160
not going to please Him. Children are commanded to obey their parents. And in

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:57.880
Colossians 3.20, it says that in so doing, they are pleasing the Lord. So it's a

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.160
simple verse of Scripture, a simple principle that we find again as we're

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:08.240
studying and proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we find that God says

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.320
in Colossians 3.20, children obey your parents and all things for this is well

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:21.720
pleasing unto the Lord. And we find that we have children that disobey. They're

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.680
not just disobeying their parents, they're disobeying the Lord. They're not

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.760
just displeasing their parents, they're displeasing the Lord. And so we

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.680
find that again, going through this process of proving what is acceptable,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:41.120
that helps us to understand not only that I can, but how can I please the Lord?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:47.200
Let me give you three ways very quickly as we close this morning. Three ways that

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.280
we can please our Master. Three ways that we can please our Master. Number one,

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.200
living a life of faith. Living a life of faith. What does it mean to live by faith?

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.120
So often we use the terminology and it seems as if there are times in which we

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.880
talk about living by faith and it seems like this mystical kind of an idea

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.040
of what does it mean to live by faith? You hear people say, well, just step out

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.720
by faith. You ever heard somebody say that? And it's as if you're just

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.640
gonna step off into nothing and you're just stepping out by faith. And they use

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.600
that kind of, listen, it's not this mystical idea of living by faith. Living

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.760
by faith and living a life of faith is trusting God, is taking God at His word,

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:40.840
that what God says, God will do, that God always does what He says He will do, that

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.880
God is, as we sang this morning, a faithful God, that He's never failed, that

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.120
He never will fail, that He provides and He supplies the needs for His people. We

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.920
find that in Hebrews chapter number 11, a verse that I mentioned a moment ago, in

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.200
verse number 6, the Bible says, but without faith it is impossible to please

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.280
Him. So what do we learn from that? We learn that we better live by faith and

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:10.080
when we do it pleases God. You think about many instances in the Word of God

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.960
where people lived by faith, where people took God at His word, that they believed

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:25.160
that what God said, God will do, how God was pleased with them and how God did

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:32.200
the miraculous, that listen, as Noah stood, excuse me, as Moses stood on the

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.920
bank of the Red Sea and he believed God, that God said, raise up your arm with

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.680
that staff and that rod, that He would part the Red Sea, that as Moses

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.280
believed God and he acted in faith, he took God at His word, then God did the

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.720
rest. Because God always does what God says He will do. When Abraham went out,

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.640
not knowing whether he went, but he went out believing God, God says that it was

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.120
by faith that he went. You can read through Hebrews 11 and you can read of

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.600
all of these that that triumphed greatly through faith, but you'll understand

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.760
this vital principle that all of them simply took God at His word. We think

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.080
about Elijah when he prayed fire from heaven. What a great passage of Scripture.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:29.320
The book of 1st Kings, we read it, we rejoice in seeing this great power of

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.679
God on display, but you'll notice something when when Elijah prays, he says

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:40.600
that I've said all this at thy word. It's a little phrase that gives us such

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.160
insight to what was happening there in that moment as Elijah was simply

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.640
believing God. He was acting in faith. And the Bible says that without faith it is

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.559
impossible to please Him, for he that cometh to God must believe that He is,

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:03.480
and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. And we find here

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:09.320
this truth, how do I live by faith? How do I walk by faith? How can I take God at

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:14.040
His word? Well, the Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.679
word of the Lord, of the Word of God. Listen, your faith is not going to be

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:22.119
increased and you're not going to live by faith if you're not spending time in

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:28.080
this book, because faith comes, is produced by hearing the truth of God's

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.640
Word. When we hear of all of the great triumphs of our God, when we hear of His

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.480
character, of His attributes, of who He is, of what He's capable of doing, it causes

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.200
me to have faith to believe. You think about the many miracles when the Lord

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.320
Jesus Christ walked upon the face of the earth, and how He would speak about,

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.040
thy faith hath made thee whole. I think about the man, Ronnie, often mentions the

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:59.640
individual that says, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief. It was believing that

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.640
God is able, that God was able, that He was able to do it.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:10.640
will do, and when I read those truths of God's Word, when I'm saturating my mind and my heart

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.920
with who my God is and what my God has done, it increases my faith.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.160
A question is asked that's a piercing question with regard to the return of the Lord.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.520
Will he find faith on the earth?

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.120
I wonder.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.600
We're to live by faith, not by sight, but by faith.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.360
Well, I just need to be able to figure all this out, and I need to be able to see it

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360
all before I...

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.680
That's not living by faith.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.040
It's just believing God.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.080
God said he would provide.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.280
God said that he would bless.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.920
God said that he would be who he says he will be, and we just believe him, and we live a

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.940
life that is marked by faith, that pleases the Lord.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.320
God is pleased when we trust him, when we believe him.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.360
Do you like people to believe you?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.480
Sure you do.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.560
We like people to believe us.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.480
We like people to trust that what we say we will do, that we will do, that they can have

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.880
confidence.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.480
God is pleased when we trust him, when we believe him, when we take God at his Word.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.240
Paul stood up with great boldness and said in Acts 27, I believe God.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.200
I believe God.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.880
God gave him a great promise in that passage of Scripture, and he believed that God was

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880
able.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:37.380
Though the circumstances didn't look like it, he said, I believe God.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.680
Notice number two.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.600
Not only can we please God by living a life of faith, we live a life that's marked by

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600
praise.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.560
I mentioned about complaining a few moments ago that it displeased the Lord, but notice

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.820
that when we praise the Lord, that it pleases the Lord.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:57.560
In Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, we started out this morning by reading a few verses of

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.900
Scripture from the book of Psalms and Psalm 34, and I made this statement that our God

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.540
is worthy of our praise.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.760
He alone is worthy of our praise.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.660
And we find here in Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, it says, by him, therefore, let us offer

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.700
the sacrifice of praise to God continually.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.660
That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:26.940
I believe that God is pleased when we praise him, that God, he inhabits the praise of his

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.380
people.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.380
We're to come before his throne with thanksgiving.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.660
We're to enter into his gates with praise and with thanksgiving.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.660
Why?

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:42.420
Because our God is worthy, and we're to offer continually to our God the fruit of our lips,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.220
the giving thanks to his name.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:51.140
And that in any situation, in any circumstance that you find yourself in in life, that God

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.020
is still on the throne and he's still good.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:01.100
He is good all the time, and he is worthy of our praise.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.300
In the most difficult of days, we can still lift our voice and praise the Lord.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.300
Why?

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.300
For he is.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.580
He is.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.580
He is holy.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.580
He is just.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.580
He is righteous.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.780
He is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.780
He is almighty.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340
He is.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.340
You keep filling in the blanks.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.340
He is.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340
He's all those things and more.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:25.860
When I learn to thank him for who he is and praise him for who he is, then my circumstances

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.700
don't matter so much because God is.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.260
Paul and Silas, they were in prison.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.140
They'd been beaten, but they sang praises unto God at midnight.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:39.180
In the midst of that prison cell, in the midst of that difficulty, they knew that God was

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.580
still worthy of their praise.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:46.220
A life that pleases the Lord, not only a life that's marked by faith, a life that's marked

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.980
by praise, but a life that's marked by giving, by giving to the Lord.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.860
You know, so often when we approach the subject of giving, people get nervous and they get

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:02.700
worked up and they reach various conclusions, but understand that giving is part of the

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.860
Christian life.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.680
We worship God through our giving.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.940
We speak about that often.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.980
We take up an offering.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.940
It's not that somebody is trying to get, no, it's that we get to give to God.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.640
We get to worship God.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.380
We get to give to God.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:21.340
Notice the book of Philippians, if you will, we're going to look at two passages very quickly

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.980
in the New Testament.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:28.300
The children of Israel, by the way, had the privilege to give to the building of the tabernacle.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.260
And as they gave, and the Bible regularly mentions, and we'll look at this in the book

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.820
of 2 Corinthians as well this morning, the Bible often mentions about willing offering,

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.220
willing.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:43.420
And they gave so much that it was said, hey, the people bring too much, they don't need

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.420
to bring anymore.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.020
Praise the Lord.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.340
They were willing.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.060
They were privileged to be able to give.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.460
Notice in Philippians chapter four, in verse number 16, the Bible says, for even in Thessalonica

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:58.520
ye sent once again unto my necessity, not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.460
that may abound to your account.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:04.820
But I have all and abound, I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.240
were sent from you.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:12.680
And then notice how Paul describes the offering that was sent from these believers to him

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.880
for the work.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:25.320
He says that it was an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.080
For some reason, there's been this stigma, if you will, with regard to speaking on the

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.760
subject of giving, that pastors shy away from it, that church people think the pastor's

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.360
just trying to get something, and the reality is that no, it's Bible.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360
It's Bible.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.800
And God says that he is well-pleased when we give.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:54.360
Listen, we're not just tipping God, we're giving to God out of a heart of love and obedience.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.840
And God is pleased with it.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.320
By the way, our giving not only pleases God, but it's also an evidence of our faith.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.160
That we believe, if we just start with the tithe and just mention the tithe for just

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:12.040
a moment, that we believe that God will do with 90 percent more than what could be done

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.400
with 100 percent.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.440
It's believing God.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.480
It's just taking God at his word.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.600
That God said that you've robbed me in the book of Malachi, where have we robbed thee?

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.000
In tithes and offerings.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.200
And he said that prove me is what he said in Malachi chapter 3.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200
And what would he do?

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:36.360
Not only would he bless them, but he would also rebuke the devourer for their sakes.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.720
Our God is able, and it's a matter of faith, it's a matter of obedience, but it's pleasing

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.720
to the Lord.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.720
Notice the people in 2 Corinthians chapter 9, and I have to hurry here, 2 Corinthians

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:57.960
chapter 9, in verses 6 and 7, the Bible says this, in 2 Corinthians 9, it's interesting

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.880
if you, I don't have time, but if you want to go back later this afternoon and read chapter

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.560
8, you'll notice that the very people that he's speaking of in chapter 9 that we're giving,

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.160
that they were in deep poverty, but yet they gave.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:17.720
And he says this, that they first gave of them their own selves to the Lord, and then

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.180
of their substance.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.320
But notice in 2 Corinthians 9 in verse 6, the Bible says, but this I say, he which soweth

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:30.320
sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.240
Now we understand this from a perspective of agriculture, do we not?

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.180
If you plant a bunch of seeds, you're going to expect to have a big crop.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.440
If you plant just a few seeds, you're going to expect to have a smaller crop.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.580
You're not going to plant a few seeds and think that you're going to have an abundance

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.740
of crop, right?

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.820
We understand agriculturally, but he's making the application here to our giving, whether

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.560
we're giving sparingly or whether we're giving bountifully.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:03.180
Notice in verse number 7, every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:13.060
But notice what it says, not grudgingly or of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful giver.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.140
It's a wonderful truth that we find here.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.620
We mentioned in Philippians chapter number 4 that God is well pleased with this, with

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620
our giving.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.540
But here in 2 Corinthians 9, the Bible says that God loveth a cheerful giver, that the

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.540
perspective is not this that I'm giving grudgingly or of necessity.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.840
It's not that I have to, it's that I get to.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:38.619
It's that God blessed me and God has enabled me to give back to him.

00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:40.179
God is pleased with that.

00:48:40.179 --> 00:48:41.179
Why?

00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:47.340
Because we're honoring him, we're exalting him, and he's pleased.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:54.179
This morning we've answered the question that yes, indeed, I can please God.

00:48:54.179 --> 00:48:58.739
And then we've considered some ways in which we are able to please him.

00:48:58.739 --> 00:48:59.739
How can I do it?

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:02.619
Okay, I understand that I can, but then how?

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:08.260
You continue to apply the principle of Ephesians 5, 10 to your life and prove what is acceptable

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.619
unto the Lord, and you'll find a number of reasons.

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:15.020
I've given you three simple thoughts this morning on how we can please God, but understand

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:21.820
the Bible is full of examples of how your behavior and my behavior can please our God,

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.299
and that we would have this idea, we'd have this perspective that we find in 2 Timothy

00:49:27.299 --> 00:49:33.580
2 and verse number 4, that I want to please my master, a good soldier.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.140
Not only does he endure hardness, not only does he avoid distraction, but he has as a

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:42.020
goal to please his master.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.780
This morning as we examine our lives, I hope that we would examine our lives in such a

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.619
way that we would determine whether our behavior pleases the Lord.

00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:53.420
Are there adjustments that need to be made?

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:58.420
Are there areas in our life where, if we're honest and if we're humble, as the Holy Spirit

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:03.179
of God searches and proves, that would say, you know, there's some areas that are not

00:50:03.179 --> 00:50:03.700
really well.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.180
well-pleasing to the Lord, then make the adjustments.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.580
There's some things that need to be adjusted.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.860
I made this statement on Wednesday evening.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.860
It's a silly thing for us to go to the truth of God's word

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.300
and to be confronted with truth

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.460
and then to not apply it, to not make adjustments,

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.540
to not say, you know what, that's something that I need,

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.500
that's something I need to incorporate in my life.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.820
No, we come to the place where we say,

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.860
listen, I want God to be pleased with my life,

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.940
and if adjustments are necessary,

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.260
then by God's grace and with God's help,

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.180
I'll make the adjustments so that my life can be pleasing

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.740
so that we could have the testimony of Enoch.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.420
He pleased the Lord.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.020
He pleased God.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:52.840
Let's pray together.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.680
Father, we love you.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.020
We thank you for loving us.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.560
Lord, this morning, the challenge is simple.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.440
Are we living in a manner that pleases you?

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.240
We acknowledge that our behavior can please you

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.160
and our behavior can displease you.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.720
We've looked at three simple thoughts.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.760
The Bible is full of examples.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.600
The list is by no way, no means exhaustive.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.360
Your word has plenty of examples for us.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.720
And I pray that you'd help each of us to have as our goal

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.280
that we want to be a good soldier

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:40.320
and that a good soldier has as a goal to please his master.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.260
And I pray that you'd help us this morning

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.680
to live our lives in such a way that you'd be pleased.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.680
Help us to examine.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.280
Help us to adjust.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.440
There's some things that we're doing

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.780
that are not pleasing your sight.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.320
Would you help us to confess them and forsake them?

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.360
There's things that we're not doing that we should be doing.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.640
Lord, help us to be obedient.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.000
Help us to be doers of the word.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.400
Help us, Lord, to live a life

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.000
that is well-pleasing in thy sight.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.480
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.840
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.680
Would you stand with me?

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.500
Heads are bowed.
