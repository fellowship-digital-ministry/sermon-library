1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,659
and we started a series in the book of Titus back at the beginning of this year, and we

2
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:13,140
made it through the ninth lesson, which was beginning Titus chapter number two in March.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,979
And then of course, COVID came and we canceled our Sunday school services and so on and so

4
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:19,979
forth.

5
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:25,239
And so now with having Sunday morning service, Sunday evening service, Wednesday evening

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:33,259
service, we were able to rearrange things and have our Sunday school classes meeting

7
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,259
on Wednesday evening.

8
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,979
And so that's what we're doing with the young people.

9
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:40,939
And so I figured that it would be appropriate for me to go back to our series through the

10
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,099
study of the book of Titus.

11
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:46,900
When we got to Titus chapter number two in verse number one, the Bible says, but speak

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,580
thou the things which become sound doctrine.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,259
Now we understand that Titus had been given responsibility.

14
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,380
According to verse number five, it says of chapter number one, for this cause left I

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,259
thee in Crete, that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting and ordain

16
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,940
elders in every city as I've appointed thee.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,959
He goes through the qualifications notice in verse number nine of chapter number one,

18
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,500
he says, holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught that he may be able notice

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,120
by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,559
And so we see that there's some references in verse number 13.

21
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:30,000
It says this witness is true, wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
faith.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
And so when we think about sound doctrine, we think the importance of doctrine.

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,360
I actually read recently where there was a pastor that was asked this question.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,980
I guess it was actually a number of pastors that were asked this question.

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,160
And the question that they were asked was what role should the senior pastor, the lead

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,199
pastor, what role should he play in selecting the songs for the song service?

28
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:58,760
And I thought it was a simple enough question that was asked to these senior pastors and

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,440
they were giving their answers.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,160
And this one particular man replied, and he said, well, you have to understand that in

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,479
our culture today and in our churches today, the songs that we sing are more important

32
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,160
than the doctrine that we teach.

33
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,679
What?

34
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,679
That's a problem.

35
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,679
Amen?

36
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:26,240
Because doctrine is absolutely imperative and we must be sound in the faith.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,000
Now I'm thankful to have the hymnal that we have and to sing the great hymns of the faith

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,679
that reinforce Bible teaching and Bible truth.

39
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:42,360
But we must understand that there is an emphasis that is placed in the Word of God with regard

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
to doctrine.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,279
There are many today that would have the attitude that doctrine really doesn't matter.

42
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,559
No doctrine does matter.

43
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,600
It matters to God.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
It's important.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
And so we think about the subject matter of sound doctrine.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,500
We then took this dive from Titus 2 and verse number 1 to dive into doctrinal truth.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,720
And so the first doctrine that we began to deal with and study was the doctrine of bibliology,

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
the study of the Scriptures.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
And we had two lessons back in March on that particular doctrine.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,820
And in those lessons we dealt with the subject matter of inspiration of the Scripture.

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,039
We dealt with the subject matter of preservation of the Scripture.

52
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,800
And we also dealt with the subject matter of the sufficiency of the Scripture.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm thankful that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm thankful that He promised to preserve it.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,960
And I'm thankful that the Word of God is sufficient.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,919
And so we dealt with those subject matters in the first couple of studies on bibliology.

57
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,160
And so this evening, as we continue with the subject matter of bibliology, I want to

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,160
address the subject matter of translation and how that impacts Bible versions.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,839
And the Bible, of course, as you know, maybe all of you know, maybe not everyone knows,

60
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,399
but the Bible was originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.

61
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:02,960
And so it was not written in English originally.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,399
And we know that this evening I am teaching and preaching from an English Bible.

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,000
And so therefore, there was a work of translation that was done.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,320
Very obvious stated fact there.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,200
When we think about the translation, though, and the work of translation, we'd have to

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,239
acknowledge that it is a very critical work.

67
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,200
And today, if you were to go online and you were to look for a Bible, or if you were to

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,399
be able to go to a Bible bookstore and look for a Bible, you will find that there are

69
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,200
scores of English versions of the Bible.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,959
There are multitudes of Bible versions that are available.

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,000
And we begin to think about that subject matter, we begin to think about these various versions

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,519
that are available on the market today.

73
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,040
And when we speak about Bible versions, we must recognize that from the very beginning

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,040
of human history, the enemy has attacked the Word of God.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,040
God spoke to Adam and gave Adam instruction, and we find in Genesis chapter number three

76
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:07,040
and verse number one that Satan comes in his subtlety and he says,

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Yea, hath God said.

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,519
In verse number four, he says not only does he question what God said, but then he questions

79
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,839
the authority of what God said and actually calls God a liar by saying, Ye shall not surely

80
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,559
die in Genesis three and verse number four.

81
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:27,600
But God had said in the day that ye eat thereof, you shall surely die.

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
And so as we begin to think about the attack upon the Word of God from the beginning of

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,040
human history, we must be cautious and acknowledge the potential for corruption through the work

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
of translation.

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,559
In other words, we begin to think about the work of translation, we think about the process

86
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:51,040
in which the Scriptures are translated, we have to be aware that corruption can find

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,320
its way in through that work of translation.

88
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,839
And so we have to be very careful of that, we have to be very cautious of that.

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,920
So this evening, obviously, if you've been around the church for any length of time,

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,000
if you've read any of our doctrinal statement, we are unashamed to be King James Bible is

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,359
what we use, it's what I preach from, it's what I study from, I don't have a multitude

92
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:18,359
of different versions in my office, I use the King James Bible, it's what we use, and

93
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm thankful for the work that God has done through the men, of course, that God used

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
over the years.

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,959
So this evening I want to look at some things with regard to the work of translation, how

96
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,799
it impacts the Bible version discussion.

97
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:38,359
If you're taking notes this evening, I want you to think about it kind of in a process

98
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:44,559
of how the work took place, how does this work, what do they do, what was the process

99
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,559
that they followed.

100
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,339
And so first of all, if you're taking notes, I want you to consider with me the text.

101
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,399
The text is of significant importance.

102
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,720
When I talk about the text, I'm talking about what was the Hebrew and Greek text that was

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,920
utilized that the translators would use in order to come up with a translation.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,200
The fact of the matter is that if you begin with a wrong text, it does not matter how

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,600
qualified you are to do the work of translation, you're going to end up with a bad product.

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Why?

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,179
Because you started with the wrong text.

108
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:25,700
If you start with a corrupt text, you could be the most scholarly person on the face of

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,179
the earth to do the work of translation, but you have a corrupt text that you start with,

110
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,260
you're never going to end up with a good product.

111
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,660
And so therefore it's important that we understand the foundation of Bible translation has to

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,859
be the text that is utilized for that translation.

113
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:46,619
We think about the King James Bible, and of course it's the Bible that we use, I've mentioned

114
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:47,619
that already.

115
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,540
But I want you to think about what Paul said.

116
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,260
Let me look at this verse in 2 Corinthians chapter number 2, and then let me deal with

117
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,380
the text issue.

118
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,299
But in 2 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul is writing back to the church at Corinth and

119
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:04,779
he makes a very interesting statement here with regard to those that would corrupt the

120
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:05,940
Word of God.

121
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,420
And so we understand, I've already expressed the fact that Satan has attacked the Word

122
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,739
of God from the start of human history, but Paul says this in 2 Corinthians 2 in verse

123
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:22,899
17, "'For we are not as many,' notice, "'which corrupt the Word of God, but as of sincerity,

124
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,579
but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.'"

125
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:33,219
And so we acknowledge this evening that there are some that would corrupt the Word of God.

126
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,340
And so we begin to think about the text, and so for the King James Bible, the Old Testament

127
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,739
is not really that big of a discussion point when it comes to Bible translations.

128
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:47,500
Most Bible translations that you would look to, they would use the traditional Masoretic

129
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,059
Hebrew text.

130
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,219
The King James Bible uses the traditional Masoretic Hebrew text.

131
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:57,460
The discussion point is very heavily leaning on the New Testament side, and we'll deal

132
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,820
with that in just a moment.

133
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,099
But the traditional Masoretic Hebrew text is a text that was passed down through the

134
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,080
Masorites, which were traditionalists.

135
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,380
They guarded the Old Testament text and they passed it down from one generation to the

136
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,380
next.

137
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,739
And it would often be referred to as the authoritative Hebrew text.

138
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:21,500
And we find that that's the text that underlies the King James Bible.

139
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,820
For the New Testament, and the greater majority of the discussion point with regard to the

140
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,419
text issue, we would look at the Greek for the New Testament, and that being the TR,

141
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,500
or the Textus Receptus.

142
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,619
The Textus Receptus, often referred to as well as the traditional received text, has

143
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:43,700
been a text that has been accepted through the history of the Christian church and has

144
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,140
passed from one generation to the next.

145
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,700
It's very interesting when we begin to talk about the Greek New Testament and the New

146
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,979
Testament text, because you'll find that there are a number of manuscripts that still exist.

147
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:58,940
And a number of the manuscripts that exist, in fact, there are a little over 5,200 of

148
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,059
those texts that still exist.

149
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:07,699
exists have been preserved today and you would find that the Textus Receptus, that 99% of

150
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:12,819
those preserved manuscripts point to the Textus Receptus.

151
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:19,519
Only 1% of them point to the other Greek text that underlined the modern translations.

152
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,659
So we begin to look at the foundation, the text that is used, and has it been corrupted?

153
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,659
Has it not been corrupted?

154
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,259
Is it a good text, is it a bad text?

155
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:34,099
Most of the modern translations, and of course I mentioned that the Hebrew text is not the

156
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:41,299
one that is most actively discussed and really dealt with, however, there is a corrupt Hebrew

157
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,459
text as well.

158
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:49,219
It's the Biblia Horatia, and that is a text that is based on the Leningrad manuscript

159
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:53,699
and it's used for some of the modern translations, though the traditional Masoretic Hebrew text

160
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,819
is definitely more popular.

161
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:01,579
But it's interesting that in the notes that they'll use is the BHK or the BHS, those are

162
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:08,459
the abbreviations for the Biblia Horatia, and it's interesting because in the footnotes

163
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:15,419
of the text, they suggest 20,000 to 30,000 alterations to the Old Testament.

164
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:22,699
That's a lot of alterations, 20,000 to 30,000 in the footnotes of that Hebrew text.

165
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,899
They say it should say this or this isn't commonly accepted, so on and so forth.

166
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,939
But I want to deal with the New Testament.

167
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:36,659
The New Testament, the Greek New Testament that underlies many, many of the modern translations

168
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,699
today is the Nestle and Allen Greek New Testament.

169
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,059
The Nestle and Allen Greek New Testament, it's in its 28th edition.

170
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:51,579
The Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament was used as a foundational tool in developing

171
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,500
the Nestle and Allen text.

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,639
It's interesting because as we get into our next point, this will make more sense as we

173
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:07,339
deal with it in its entirety, but the Allen of Nestle and Allen, he had some really, really

174
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:14,099
difficulty in accepting the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture.

175
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,819
And so you think about that just for a moment.

176
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:23,619
If he's one of the leading authors of the Greek New Testament text and he doesn't believe

177
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:30,199
in the inerrancy and the inspiration of the New Testament, that's problematic.

178
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:36,059
How is that work of translation going to work if he's already questioning the authority,

179
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,839
the inerrancy, the inspiration of the very text that he's beginning to work with?

180
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,520
And so we find that there's that Nestle and Allen text, there's a lot of information that

181
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,839
they receive from Vaticanus and Sinaticus, and they refer to those as B and Aleph are

182
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,919
the way in which they refer to those.

183
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,759
And here's a careful point of consideration.

184
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,759
Those texts were widely rejected due to corruption.

185
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,039
In fact, the Vaticanus and the Sinaticus, just in the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and

186
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:19,039
John, there are 3,000 contradictions just in the first four books of the New Testament

187
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,399
between those two texts.

188
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,399
3,000.

189
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,399
That's a lot.

190
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,959
And what we find is that some will give you this kind of line of thinking is that, well,

191
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,800
those texts are older and therefore they're better.

192
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,959
But older doesn't always mean better, right?

193
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,319
And so they think that because it's older that it's better.

194
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:46,559
Also, they will say that some of them are more preserved than some of the other texts

195
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
that we have.

196
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,039
Well, yeah, they're more preserved because people didn't use them.

197
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,000
Because they rejected them.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,179
Because they said, no, that's a corrupt text and they rejected them.

199
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,039
And we would understand that as you read the New Testament and you read about the warnings

200
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,440
from Paul and you read about the warnings from Peter, there were false teachers right

201
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,239
away in the first century.

202
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,319
So what would they do?

203
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:10,279
In fact, if you look at the book of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, those two books, and really

204
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,279
in 2 Thessalonians, you find that Paul is writing to the church at Thessalonica for

205
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,940
a second time and he's helping them to understand that somebody had sent a letter under his

206
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,160
name to them and caused them all kinds of confusion with regard to doctrinal matters.

207
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,079
And so Paul is seeking to set those things straight in dealing with the canon of Scripture,

208
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:38,959
the inspiration of Scripture, and we find that that is a known practice in the first

209
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:47,600
century early on with these corrupt, false teachers that were sending forth false letters.

210
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,519
And so we have to be careful that we understand and begin to deal with the work of translation

211
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,760
and how that goes into the Bible version discussion is that we have to have the right

212
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
text.

213
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,299
After we have the right text, we have to think about the translators.

214
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:05,679
So who is going to be the individuals?

215
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:11,959
Who are the individuals going to be that will work on the translation of the Scriptures?

216
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,720
I would ask the question this way, are they qualified?

217
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,279
And by the way, the qualification is not only on whether or not they know the languages.

218
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,839
You can know the language and be lost.

219
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,600
And if you're lost, you probably aren't the right candidate to be translating God's

220
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Holy Word.

221
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Amen?

222
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,880
And so when you think about the translators, I want you to think about what, of course,

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,799
some of these individuals, and I'll read to you a few statements that some of the translators

224
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,839
for the King James Bible, some of the things that they said.

225
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,679
And we understand as we look at the translators, there were 57 men that were commissioned to

226
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,880
work on the translation of the King James Bible.

227
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,359
They were divided into six groups.

228
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:03,359
The work started in 1604 and ended in 1611.

229
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:07,200
These men were all trained in the original languages of the Scriptures.

230
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Not only were they trained in the original languages of the Scriptures, but many of them

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,320
were also very conversant with various cognate languages, or sister languages, such as Arabic,

232
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Persian, Syrian, and Coptic.

233
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,440
And so these men were very qualified from a perspective of their language understanding.

234
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,919
But more importantly than their language abilities, they understood and believed that the Bible

235
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,480
is the Word of God.

236
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
They not only believed that the Bible is the Word of God, but they understood that it has

237
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,760
power to change lives, and they believed that it needed to be available to the common man

238
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,559
so that it could be read and obeyed.

239
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,480
Now that's a good perspective of a translator that is going to be qualified for the work,

240
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
that's going to take the right text.

241
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,480
They're going to take the traditional Masoretic text for the Hebrew, they're going to take

242
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,000
the Textus Receptus for the New Testament, the Greek, and they're going to then take

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
that right text and they have the right qualified translators.

244
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
Here's some of what they said.

245
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,839
They said this, that the original, speaking of the Word of God, thereof being from heaven,

246
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,839
not from earth.

247
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,239
The author being God, not man.

248
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:22,480
The inditer, the Holy Spirit, not the wit of apostles or prophets.

249
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,000
So that was the Word of God.

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,040
They go on to say that the Scriptures, in the Scriptures, we are commanded to search

251
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,519
the Scriptures.

252
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,959
They that search the Scriptures and study the Scriptures were commended for doing so.

253
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:41,639
They were reproved that were unskillful in them or slow to believe them.

254
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:47,679
They then said this, take up and read, take up and read the Scriptures.

255
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,720
Indeed, without translation into the generally used tongue, that the common people are but

256
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,440
like children at Jacob's well without a bucket or something to draw with.

257
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,079
A blessed thing it is and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end when God

258
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,919
speaketh unto us and we hearken, we obey.

259
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,079
And so they had this perspective that when they were going to approach the Scriptures

260
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:23,119
to translate from Hebrew and Greek into English, they understood we have to have the right

261
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:29,000
text, but they also understood that what they were dealing with was the Word of God.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,960
By the way, translation is not interpretation.

263
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,039
The work of translation is to simply translate what God has said, not to interpret it, not

264
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,719
to slant it toward your own beliefs or your own desires.

265
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:51,559
You can do some study and you can see some ways in which, as I mentioned some of the

266
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:57,479
things a moment ago about Nestle and Allen and some of his perspectives and his difficulty

267
00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:02,440
with accepting the canon of Scripture and the inerrancy and the inspiration of Scripture.

268
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,119
You can look at some of the things of Westcott and Hort, where in many regards they were

269
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,960
very apostate in some of the foundational doctrinal things and they just wanted to remove

270
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
certain things.

271
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,719
You are tampering with the Word of God and that's a very dangerous thing.

272
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,799
So we find that these individuals, these 57 men that are the translators for the King

273
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,840
James Bible, that they were commissioned to do this work, they had this proper perspective

274
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,960
so they were going to then translate the work.

275
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,039
I want you to think about the technique.

276
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:43,760
Turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter number 14, if you will, and before I share with you

277
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,479
this evening the technique that they employed, I want you to think about this verse in 1

278
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:56,520
Corinthians 14 and verse number 40 where God says this, let all things be done decently

279
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,640
and in order.

280
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,119
And that's a good verse of Scripture.

281
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,279
that's applicable in a number of different places in our lives and in our ministries.

282
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,919
But we understand that even when they were going to take the approach and the technique

283
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,159
that they would employ, the methods that they would use for translation, that it was a very

284
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,319
orderly process that they followed. We'd find that each group, I mentioned that there were 57

285
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:26,279
men that were divided into six groups, that each group was assigned a portion of Scripture.

286
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:33,959
The individuals within that group, they had to translate by themselves the portion that was

287
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:38,599
assigned to them. And so whatever portion was assigned to them, they had the responsibility

288
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,479
to translate that themselves. And then the group would assemble to confer and agree on the product.

289
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,679
So think about the amount of work that this is taking and think about the number of reviews

290
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,999
that this process is going through. We find that after they would finish in their particular group

291
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:02,359
and the portion of Scripture that they were given, that product was then sent to the other

292
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:08,199
five groups for review. And so we reviewed our portion, we did all of our translation,

293
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:12,279
we did all of our work, I did it personally, and then I shared it with each of the individuals in

294
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,079
my group and we conferred and we said, yes, this is the product that we want to send forth.

295
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,799
We send it to the other five groups and then they go through it and they say, yes, this is

296
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:28,279
done appropriately. And so they review it. And then there was a final review group that was

297
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,359
assembled that consisted of two individuals from each of those groups and they made one final

298
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:40,679
review of the entire Bible. Why do I go through that process? Because that would reveal to us as

299
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:48,599
they employed this technique or these methods in translation, that each portion of Scripture

300
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:57,319
was reviewed at a minimum of 14 times. 14 times. That's pretty significant. And you can understand

301
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:02,599
that as they took that approach, as they went through the process and the technique that they

302
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,999
employed, they wanted to do this live because they understood what they were handling. They

303
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,239
understood the significance of it. They understood that this was the Word of God and they wanted to

304
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:19,000
get it into the common language of the common man so that they could have the Bible for themselves.

305
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:25,159
We find that not only did they follow that process, but when they would take and begin to

306
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:32,919
translate the Scriptures, that they would use a term that we would use to describe their work

307
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,319
was literal equivalence. What does it mean? Well, literal equivalence can be broken down into two

308
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,199
fragments, if you will. One is verbal equivalence and then the other is formal equivalence.

309
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:51,080
And what we mean by that is in verbal equivalence that every word in the original was translated.

310
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,239
Formal equivalence means that the part of speech remained consistent. Now,

311
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,839
this evening, if you believe as we have taught and we looked at when we dealt with our first study

312
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:16,119
of bibliology in the verbal plenary inspiration of Scripture, then it would be necessary and expected

313
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:21,159
that you would use literal equivalence for the work of translation. Because you believe that

314
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,639
every word of God is inspired, and so therefore if you're going to translate it, you translate

315
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:36,440
every word. See, the opposite of literal equivalence is really what is practiced by a

316
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,119
host of those modern English versions of the Bible that you see on the market today,

317
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:49,399
and they use not that of literal equivalence, but that of dynamic equivalence. We think about

318
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:54,679
dynamic equivalence in these modern translations and the translators and what they do, and this

319
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:02,039
is from their own people. They say this, that they're not really concerned about the individual

320
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:11,239
words. Their concern is more with the thoughts, ideas, or message of the text. Now, I have a

321
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:19,479
problem with that. Why? Because the Bible says that every word of God is pure, and so I'm concerned

322
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:25,720
about the very words of God. I'm concerned that every word is translated, that I'm not just given

323
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,000
this, well, here's kind of what I think God was trying to say in this passage of Scripture,

324
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,799
and giving me a big thought or a big idea. No, I want to know what the words are,

325
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,479
and so let's take a look at some of these verses of Scripture. Turn to the book of Psalms, if you

326
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:47,880
will, in Psalm chapter number 12. It's a passage that we're familiar with, and we've often referenced

327
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,079
Psalm 12, dealing with the subject matter of preservation, and I'm thankful that God said that

328
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:58,839
He would preserve His Word, that He would keep them forever, and what a blessing it is. We know

329
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,519
that Psalm 119, the passage of Scripture that deals with the Bible, talks much about the words of God

330
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:10,119
and that it's forever settled in heaven, but in Psalm 12 and verses 6 and 7, the Bible says this,

331
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:19,959
the words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

332
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:28,119
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever.

333
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,160
Proverbs chapter number 30, in verse number 5,

334
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:46,279
in Proverbs 30, in verse number 5, notice what it said here, every word of God is pure.

335
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:55,239
He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him. It's not just the thoughts or the ideas,

336
00:25:55,239 --> 00:26:00,519
but it's the very words of God. By the way, Jesus said that not one jot or tittle would pass, right?

337
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,880
And you begin to understand the importance of the words. He says that in Matthew 5 in verse number

338
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,440
18. I want you to look over at John 7, if you will. Let me give you an example, just real quick

339
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:18,119
here, if I could, as to the importance of words, and every word of God being important. In John

340
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,679
chapter number 7, there was a feast, the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem, and of course there

341
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,679
are many that were getting ready to go, and Jesus says in verse number 6, my time has not yet come,

342
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,679
but your time is already ready. And of course, his brethren at that time, according to verse

343
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,679
number 5, did not believe in him. And so they were going to go, and of course, there were several

344
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,119
that knew that Jesus would be there. It was required, in fact, by Jewish males to attend

345
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,760
these particular feasts during the time in Jerusalem. There were certain times of the

346
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,000
calendar each year that they had the responsibility of doing that. But look at verse number 8 with me,

347
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,320
if you will. Jesus says this, go ye up unto this feast. I go not up, what's the next word?

348
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,799
Yet. That's just one word, right? But what if we remove that word? I go not up unto this feast,

349
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:17,799
for my time is not yet full come. I go not up to the feast, unto this feast. So what is he saying?

350
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm not going. I go not up unto this feast, right? If we remove yet. Do you know that there are many

351
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,600
modern translations that remove the word yet? In John 7 and verse number 8. It's just a three-letter

352
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,760
word. It's a simple word. But guess what happens when he had said these words unto them, he abode

353
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,639
still in Galilee, but when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast in verse

354
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:47,079
number 10. So if he said I'm not going, and then he went, that becomes problematic, does it not?

355
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:57,160
Jesus said I go not up yet unto this feast. Just one simple example this evening of how important

356
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,079
words are. Have you ever been taken out of context? Somebody's said something about you,

357
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,720
or you said something, and they missed some of your words, and said, no, that's not exactly what

358
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:13,000
I said. And you understand the importance of your words. God gave us his words, and he told us that

359
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,399
his words are pure. By the way, he gave a grave warning in Revelation chapter number 22 with

360
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:29,320
regard to tampering with the words of God. We find that God has given us exactly what he's given us.

361
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,839
Every word of God is pure, and no one gave him a requirement for how many words he had to give us,

362
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:40,839
and how many chapters, and so on and so forth. We find that in Revelation 22 and verse number 19,

363
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:46,919
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy. So I want you to

364
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,279
understand that when we begin to think about the the words of scripture, we begin to think about

365
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:59,159
the process in which these men employed, the technique, the methods of translation for those

366
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,880
that were translating the King James Bible, and understanding what they believed about the Bible,

367
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,279
they had the text that was the right text, the traditional Masoretic text for the Hebrew,

368
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:17,080
for the Old Testament, the TR for the New Testament for the Greek. We find that they end up

369
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,919
with a product that is a superior product. It is God doing what God said he would do in preserving

370
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:32,839
his word. But just for a moment, consider the thought of the Aland of Nestle and Alan with the

371
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:39,239
Greek New Testament. Remember, he had concern about the inerrancy and the inspiration of

372
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:44,679
scripture. He questioned many times. He wrote books. You can read some of the books that he

373
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,799
wrote. They're still available. In fact, I read through some of it just recently, and you can

374
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:56,440
read where he questions the canonicity of the scripture, and denying that certain books should

375
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,039
be even included in the canon of scripture, and so on and so forth. And so if you

376
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,439
wholesale, say, these books don't really belong in the Bible, and then you are

377
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:11,039
writing a Greek New Testament, what then happens when you start removing words

378
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,279
and you remove verses and you put, well, that's not really supposed to be there?

379
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,679
It becomes very problematic. In Acts chapter number 8, another simple

380
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,039
illustration for you this evening, and we'll end with this illustration. I'll

381
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,679
make some concluding statements and get into our prayer time this evening, but in

382
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,279
Acts chapter number 8, many of the modern translations will just completely skip a

383
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:44,679
verse of Scripture here in this text. And I count 36, 37, 38, right? That's kind of a

384
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,039
normal way to count. If you look in Acts 8 and verse number 36, at the end of the

385
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,599
verse, the eunuch says to Philip, see here is water, what doth hinder me to be

386
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,479
baptized? So that's Acts 8 36, so you would expect to see in Acts 8 37. And in

387
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:03,199
Acts 8 37, it says that Philip responds to him, Philip said, if thou believest

388
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:07,119
with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus

389
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,439
Christ is the Son of God. That's his profession. And then you see verse number

390
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:18,319
38, again 36, 37, 38, it says he commanded, Philip commanded the chariot to stand

391
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,419
still, and they went down both in the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he

392
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,199
baptized him. Wouldn't it be kind of odd if you went from verse 36 to verse 38?

393
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:33,759
Wouldn't you wonder where's 37? Right? So in some of the modern translations, not

394
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,439
all of them, but in some of the modern translations, if you look at it, I did

395
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,599
this specifically with the New International Version, I looked it up

396
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,279
online, you see Acts 8 36, you see the text there, you see 37 and there's no

397
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,999
words, and then you see 38 in the verse. It's completely omitted, you go down to

398
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,919
the footnotes and it says this verse isn't commonly accepted in the

399
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:02,039
manuscripts. How does that work? And my question is this, does that have any

400
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,199
impact on doctrine? Sure it does. Here's water, what does it mean to be baptized?

401
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:11,519
Oh, you want to get baptized? Let's get baptized. That's how it reads in some of

402
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,319
the modern translations, because they remove verse number 37, that is, how

403
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,359
do we baptize people? We say this, based upon your profession of faith, I now

404
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,519
baptize you, right? That's what we say. Every time I baptize somebody, that's

405
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,119
what I say. Hey, are you 100% sure if you were to die today that you'd go to

406
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,119
heaven? Have you trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? Yes, I have. That's

407
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,959
their profession. I've already spoken to them before we ever got in the baptismal

408
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,559
tank to understand that they are saved, because the candidate for

409
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,639
baptism is a saved individual. And so if you remove verse number 37, here's what

410
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:47,839
the people want to tell you today. Oh, it doesn't really change

411
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:54,199
any doctrine. Of course it does. And this is just one simple illustration this

412
00:32:54,239 --> 00:33:01,479
evening. There's many that you could go to. The Bible tells us that there are

413
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:06,199
going to be false teachers, just as there were false prophets. And we know that the

414
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:09,719
enemy has sought to attack the Word of God from the very beginning of human

415
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:15,879
history. As we claim the promises of God, as we examine the evidence of translation

416
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:21,239
work, we conclude that God did in fact preserve His Word in the Masoretic Text,

417
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:25,239
the traditional Masoretic Text for the Old Testament, the Textus Receptus for the

418
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:29,239
New Testament, and those are the underlying texts for the King James

419
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:34,599
Bible. I don't speak Hebrew, and I don't speak Greek. I know a few words in both. I

420
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,879
know how to look them up and find out what they mean, and I learned how to say

421
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:43,319
some of them, but I would never consider myself a Hebrew or Greek scholar. I'm

422
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,239
thankful that I have an English Bible, and I'm thankful for how God used

423
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:56,279
individuals over 400 years ago now to do that work of translation. Individuals

424
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:01,599
that believed about the Bible the same things that we believe about the Bible.

425
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,599
It's God's Word. It's necessary to be made available to the people in

426
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,839
their language, so that they can read it, so that they can obey it, so

427
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:19,839
they can be blessed by it. And these men, over 400 years ago, God used to do that

428
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,719
work of translation, and I would submit to you this evening that they used the

429
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:30,119
right text. That they used, or as the translators, they had the right

430
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,719
perspective, and then they used the right techniques. And through having the right

431
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,719
text, having the right people, and using the right techniques, you end up with a

432
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:44,599
superior product. And I'm so thankful that God has given us His Word. There's

433
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,479
so many more things that could be said on the discussion of the Bible

434
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:52,159
translations. There are volumes of books that have been written on this topic, and

435
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,959
so I've tried to kind of simmer it all down and give you one service this

436
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,479
evening on the subject matter, but of course there is much that could be

437
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,959
discussed on it, and I trust there's been a blessing to you. Let's go to the Lord

438
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:07,679
in prayer. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your

439
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,719
Word and the truth contained therein. We thank you that we have the Bible, and I

440
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,679
pray God that you would help us to be students of thy Word. Help us to be doers

441
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,479
of the Word. Lord, help us to appreciate those that have gone before us that

442
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:28,079
have faithfully and diligently followed you and obeyed you to allow us to have

443
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,439
the Bible that we hold in our hands this evening. Help us to be engaged in the

444
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:36,999
work of sharing your Word with those that we come into contact with. Bless our

445
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:42,439
time of prayer. We'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
