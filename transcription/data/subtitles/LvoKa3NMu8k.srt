1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Colossians chapter number two.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,400
We'll finish up this particular chapter this morning

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,519
and really kind of make it, if you will,

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,920
halfway through the book

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,159
and certainly have enjoyed the book of Colossians.

6
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,960
Of course, we took a number of weeks,

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,319
really several months off with some other things

8
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,280
that we're dealing with and preaching through

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,299
and I got back to the book of Colossians

10
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,479
last Sunday morning.

11
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,159
And last week was message number 10.

12
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,319
We looked at verses 11 through 15

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,239
and we dealt with that statement

14
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,879
that he made in verse number 14,

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,220
nailing it to his cross.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,919
Aren't you thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ

17
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,919
accomplished for you at the cross of Calvary?

18
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:40,759
And how wonderful to know that you're saved,

19
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,819
that you're heaven bound, amen?

20
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:44,599
And we're so thankful for that.

21
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,880
Verses 16 through 23 will be the focus

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,439
of our message this morning.

23
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,759
If you've looked at the bulletin,

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,759
you'll note that the title for the message

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,040
is Traps of False Teaching.

26
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,319
And I'll say this, there are many traps of false teaching.

27
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,119
The false teachers are deceptive,

28
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,360
they're active and we find it, of course,

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,919
that these false teachers were active here in Colossi.

30
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,699
We dealt with this many months ago

31
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,000
when we really were dealing with the introduction

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,839
to the book of Colossians and dealt with

33
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,199
some of the false teachers that were prevalent,

34
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,639
what have you.

35
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:16,639
The way in which Paul began the second chapter,

36
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,839
speaking of that great conflict that he had for them,

37
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,480
not only for those in Colossi,

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,839
but also for those that were in Laodicea

39
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:26,199
and he had this conflict for them

40
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,379
because he understood that these false teachers

41
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,540
were active.

42
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:32,819
I do not think it would be inappropriate

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,620
for me to say today that false teachers

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,580
continue to be active.

45
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,819
And we know that the Apostle Peter's,

46
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,300
he's writing to those that he's writing to

47
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,459
in the second letter, second Peter,

48
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,779
he deals with false teachers,

49
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:47,199
he deals with their characteristics and so on and so forth

50
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:51,260
and he makes this truth, this statement to these believers

51
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,620
and he talks about how there were false prophets

52
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,959
in the Old Testament and that there will be

53
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,139
false teachers today.

54
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,379
And we know that to be the case,

55
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,900
you can read through the Old Testament

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,059
and you can read of the false prophets that existed

57
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,879
and the way in which they gave false messages

58
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,020
to the people of God,

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,699
but I'm thankful for the true prophets of God.

60
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,539
I'm thankful for those prophets of God

61
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,539
that stood and delivered the message from God Almighty

62
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,100
to the people that he called them to minister to

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,860
and you can read through the Old Testament

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,020
and you can read of these prophets

65
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,339
and of their courage and of their faith

66
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,740
and what a blessing to know that they were faithful

67
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,179
to God Almighty.

68
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,220
So we are not ignorant this morning

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,460
of the attacks upon truth.

70
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,660
We understand this morning that the enemy

71
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,979
has been in opposition to the truth

72
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:40,660
from the very beginning.

73
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,679
The fact of the matter is that all the way back

74
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,720
in the book of Genesis in the third chapter,

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,539
we find that Satan, the serpent,

76
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,699
who's more subtle than any of the beasts of the field,

77
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,279
he says, yea, hath God said.

78
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:54,899
He's questioning the Word of God.

79
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,500
He's undermining the authority of God's Word

80
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,660
and then he continues on and he says this,

81
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,979
ye shall not surely die.

82
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,580
But we understand that God had given truth

83
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,000
and no matter how the enemy will seek to oppose truth,

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,119
that truth marches on, that truth stands

85
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:19,059
and I'm thankful for truth and that we,

86
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:22,100
this morning, have the truth of the Word of God.

87
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,179
I believe this morning that it would be fair to say

88
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,619
that the methods employed by false teachers

89
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:29,220
have been varied.

90
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,059
Their methods are varied.

91
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:33,779
The reality is that this reminds us

92
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:37,880
of the importance of being grounded in the truth

93
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,259
because the methods, listen, we're not ignorant

94
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,139
of his devices, Paul says that in 2 Corinthians,

95
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,020
but we do find that the methods,

96
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,520
the means in which are employed by these false teachers

97
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,300
will vary from generation to generation

98
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,539
and it reminds us of how vitally important it is

99
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,539
that we would be grounded on the Word of God

100
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,139
and the truth of God's Word.

101
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,139
I have often said that the answer to error is always truth.

102
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,479
The answer to error is truth.

103
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,020
We find that a preacher of yesteryear,

104
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,139
he made this statement,

105
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,140
error cannot flourish where sound doctrine holds sway.

106
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Error cannot flourish where sound doctrine holds sway.

107
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,679
Why?

108
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,660
Because we know the truth

109
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,220
and we know the truth of the Word of God

110
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,500
and we're sound in the doctrine

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,540
and therefore when the false teaching

112
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,519
and the false teachers try to come in,

113
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,260
we're able to stand upon the truth of the Word of God

114
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,459
and that false doctrine cannot, it will not,

115
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,019
that error will not flourish.

116
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,260
I think about the admonition that Peter gives

117
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,799
at the end of that second letter

118
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,299
that I mentioned a moment ago.

119
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,459
Hold your place then in the book of Colossians if you will

120
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,019
and look to 2 Peter chapter number three.

121
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,940
And as you would do a survey of the book of 2 Peter,

122
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,420
you'll find that he deals with these false teachers

123
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,179
and their condemnation

124
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,220
and he deals with the characteristics of these individuals

125
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,019
and he's seeking to encourage

126
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,619
and instruct the people of God.

127
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,579
It's interesting how he ends

128
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,059
this particular epistle.

129
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,140
Notice with me in 2 Peter three in verse number 17.

130
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:13,980
He says,

131
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,380
Ye therefore, beloved,

132
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,420
seeing ye know these things before,

133
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,739
notice this warning,

134
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,899
beware lest ye also being led away

135
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,179
with the error of the wicked

136
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:29,140
fall from your own steadfastness.

137
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,579
But what does he say?

138
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,140
But grow in grace

139
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,100
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

140
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,100
to Him be glory both now and forever.

141
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,459
Amen.

142
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,859
We understand that Peter had earlier said

143
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:49,579
in the first epistle to the same group of believers,

144
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,059
he says to them in 1 Peter two in verse number two,

145
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:56,579
as newborn babes desiring the sincere milk of the Word

146
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,540
that ye may grow thereby.

147
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,500
The false teachers are going to be active.

148
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,299
They're going to use, employ their methods.

149
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,980
They're going to seek to deceive.

150
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,899
And we understand that here in Colossians chapter number two,

151
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,059
the apostle Paul really will deal with three traps

152
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,260
of the false teachers,

153
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,459
three aspects of false teaching, if you will,

154
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,059
in these particular traps.

155
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,660
We know that Paul has sought to give truth

156
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,299
to these believers.

157
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,820
And we know that Paul is warning these believers.

158
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,980
Remember, as he mentioned to these believers

159
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
in the first chapter in verse number 28

160
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,700
of chapter number one of the book of Colossians,

161
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,540
he says,

162
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,859
whom we preach, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

163
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,260
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom.

164
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Why?

165
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,100
That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

166
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,179
As we look at these false teachers that are active

167
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,019
and we understand what Paul is dealing with,

168
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,640
as I've mentioned already this morning

169
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,059
by way of introduction,

170
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,260
false teachers continue to be active today.

171
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,739
I would say this,

172
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,339
I believe that their influence reaches further today

173
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,859
than it ever has.

174
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,140
Why is that?

175
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,339
Well, because we have this thing called the internet.

176
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,260
And as good as the internet can be

177
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,459
and as helpful as the resources can be on the internet,

178
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,420
you understand that that internet,

179
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,459
that platform is being utilized

180
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,339
for bad reasons and causes as well.

181
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,420
And we don't even need to get into all the sin

182
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,940
and the wickedness that exists on the internet,

183
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,779
but you think about the false teaching

184
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,019
and how easy it is for someone to go into Google

185
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,859
and to just type in some type of a search

186
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,619
and have all sorts of results and responses come.

187
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,339
And people sometimes have this attitude.

188
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,579
Well, it must be true because I read it on the internet.

189
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,100
Beware, amen.

190
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,619
There is much false teaching that exists on the internet

191
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,640
and the false teachers have been able

192
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,380
to broaden their influence exponentially

193
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,420
because of the internet.

194
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,299
And it's so vital that we as the people of God

195
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,779
acknowledge that danger and set our heart

196
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,059
to seek the law of the Lord

197
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:17,459
to understand the truth of God's Word.

198
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,019
This morning, look at verse number 16.

199
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:20,859
The Bible says,

200
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:25,859
let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink

201
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,660
or in respect of an holy day

202
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,340
or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days,

203
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,940
which are a shadow of things to come,

204
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,260
but the body is of Christ.

205
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,700
Let no man beguile you of your reward

206
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,859
in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels,

207
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:47,099
intruding into those things which he hath not seen,

208
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:50,460
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind

209
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,539
and not holding the head

210
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,059
from which all the body by joints and bands

211
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:58,340
having nourishment ministered and knit together

212
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,099
increaseth with the increase of God.

213
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,979
Verse 20.

214
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,820
Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,619
from the rudiments of the world,

216
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:10,619
why, as though living in the world,

217
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:13,340
are ye subject to ordinances,

218
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,619
touch not, taste not, handle not,

219
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:18,299
which all are to perish with the using

220
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,820
after the commandments and doctrines of men,

221
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,500
which things have indeed a show of wisdom

222
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,419
and will worship and humility

223
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,059
and neglecting of the body,

224
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,219
not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.

225
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,140
Trap number one, if you're taking notes,

226
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,219
the trap of legalism.

227
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:38,940
Verse 16 and 17 deals with the trap of legalism.

228
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,700
And legalism is a dependence upon moral law

229
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,219
rather than on that personal faith

230
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,940
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

231
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,539
It is a dependence upon moral law.

232
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,619
It's a dependence upon that outward.

233
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,659
It's really the idea of adding works to grace

234
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,539
and understanding that there's something

235
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,140
that I must do in order to gain.

236
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,060
the favor of God. You understand that we were dead in our sins and our trespasses

237
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,740
and he hath quickened us, he made us alive. We find that Paul really, it's of

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,480
note, and we'll mention it many times throughout the message this morning, but

239
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,940
it's of note that he tells them in verse number 10 and we've used it for our

240
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:25,440
theme this year, ye are complete in him. And we find this trap of legalism and we

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,600
find that Paul begins in verse number 16 by saying, let no man therefore judge

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
you. He's gonna list some things particularly that he's speaking of, but

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,280
we find that judgment is a prevalent factor within the scope, if you will, of

244
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,160
legalism and thus Paul begins by using this phrase, let no man therefore judge

245
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,520
you. Now the message this morning is not on judging or on judgment, but you

246
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,000
understand that the truth of God's Word is that we are to judge all things. We

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
understand that people say, judge not lest you be judged, that's a Bible truth

248
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,760
as well, and the reality though is that with the judgment that we would speak of,

249
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,520
if we are to engage in judgment, it is to be based upon the truth of the Word of

250
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,800
God. And we understand here that as these individuals, these legalists, if you will,

251
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,560
if we can use that phraseology, we find that the reference here, and understand

252
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,920
in the first century there is a really interesting period of time,

253
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
transitional period of time that's taking place, and Jews are saved and

254
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,360
Gentiles are saved, and the church, this mystery that's made up of Jew and

255
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,520
Gentile, and you think about this transitional period of time and

256
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,960
really some difficulties, and it was a great opportunity, if you will, for these

257
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,280
false teachers to pounce on it, and for these false teachers to come in, and you

258
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,400
understand that false teachers are opportunistic. They're going to seize the

259
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,160
opportunity that presents itself in order to propagate their false teaching

260
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,360
and to deceive as many as they possibly can. We find here that as these

261
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,120
references that are given in verse 16 and 17 with subject to this trap of

262
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,160
legalism, they have obvious reference to the Old Testament law. We find that it's

263
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,200
interesting, and we'll look at verse 16 in more detail here in just a moment, but

264
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
it's interesting that as Paul says, let no man therefore judge you in these

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,960
things, and we'll look at it in a moment, notice what he says in verse 17, which

266
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:38,160
are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ. Remember last year we

267
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,840
preached through the book of Hebrews, and what a great truth that God gives us in

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,960
Hebrews chapter number 10, one of my just favorite passages of Scripture when

269
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,480
the Bible begins in verse number 1 of Hebrews 10, and says, for the law having a

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,080
shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never,

271
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,520
with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers

272
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,280
thereunto perfect. Talks about the blood of bulls and goats, and it should not

273
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,720
take away sins, but we find that as we enter and go further through the text of

274
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Scripture in Hebrews 10, that the Bible says, but this man, speaking of the Lord

275
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,120
Jesus Christ in verse number 12 of Hebrews 10, after he'd offered one

276
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:30,560
sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God. I'm so thankful

277
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,960
for the Lord Jesus Christ. And we find that false teachers, the reality is that

278
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,560
as you would boil things down and look at all of the false teachers that are

279
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,960
prevalent, they all err within the scope of how they deal with Christ. And

280
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,400
looking at, listen, we understand that Christ is sufficient, that the sacrifice

281
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,760
that he made on the cross of Calvary satisfied the demands of a holy God, and

282
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,360
he is all we need, and we find that here the Old Testament, it's a shadow of

283
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,600
things to come, but Christ has come, and Christ has fulfilled the law. And we find

284
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,080
here that these legalists, they're judging people, notice in particular in

285
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,920
verse number 16, in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or of the new

286
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,680
moon or of the Sabbath days. Notice with me this truth that is given here in the

287
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,280
way in which they're judging, and I want you to hold your place here in Colossians,

288
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,920
and we have the benefit this morning of having the entire canon of Scripture. And

289
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,840
by the way, that is a huge benefit. You understand in the first century, these

290
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,600
believers in Colossae, as they're receiving this letter, they don't have

291
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
the same benefit that we have this morning of turning here and turning

292
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,280
there and looking at this passage and looking at that passage and comparing

293
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,000
Scripture with Scripture, but we have that benefit and that blessing, and we

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,040
find that as we look at the whole of Scripture that we're able to determine

295
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,160
the mind of the Lord and we're able to easier, it becomes easier for us to

296
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,080
identify false teaching. Notice with regard to meat, notice over in 1st

297
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,280
Timothy chapter number 4, turn over to that passage if you will, and notice what

298
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,240
Paul is saying to Timothy here in this portion of Scripture. He's dealing here

299
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,120
again with these false teachers and talking about those that would come in

300
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,040
and just the way in which they speak lies and hypocrisy and so on and so forth.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,320
But as we look here in 1st Timothy chapter number 4, it says in verse

302
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:38,560
number 3, forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which

303
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,160
God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and

304
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,320
know the truth. For every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it

305
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,720
be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.

306
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm thankful for this passage of Scripture. Listen, dietary things have

307
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,120
changed, pre-flood, post-flood, the law, after the law, the fulfillment of the New

308
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Testament, the fulfillment of Christ and the law in the New Testament. You see

309
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,900
here, he says every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be

310
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,560
received with thanksgiving, and I'm thankful for the truth of the Word of

311
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,520
God. They were judging in meat, not only in meat, in drink. There's a very simple

312
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,040
verse of Scripture that we know in 1st Corinthians 10 and verse number 31,

313
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,360
whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, what does it say? Do

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,520
all to the glory of God. Amen? Think about this thing of holy days. It's mentioned

315
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,800
in verse number 16 of Colossians chapter number 2, and you

316
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,320
think about the reference here again as I've mentioned this transitional period

317
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,280
in the New Testament and understanding the way in which these Jews that would

318
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,200
have been saved and part of the church, this mystery, the Jews and Gentiles as

319
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,280
one body of believers, and you think about these false teachers and they're

320
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,840
judging with respect to holy days, new moon, the Sabbath days. I just finished

321
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,240
reading through the book of Leviticus again, and you read through the book of

322
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,520
Leviticus and you read all about their feast and all about the various aspects

323
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,280
of the Jewish calendar and how they had their Sabbaths and how they had all of

324
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,080
their feasts and so on and so forth, and there were three times in a year in

325
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,440
which all the males were to present themselves, and you just look at how

326
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,940
their calendar operated and how it was focused upon those things, and we

327
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,360
understand that if we look again at what he says in verse number 17, which are a

328
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,720
shadow of things to come. Listen, when you study all of the truth of the Old

329
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,680
Testament, you begin to look at those feast days and all of the sacrifices and

330
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,000
all of those truths that are given, you find that they point to the Lord

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Jesus Christ. The typology is rich when you study through the tabernacle and you

332
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,440
study the various pieces of furniture and the materials that were used for

333
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,640
construction, and you see how it points to Christ in typology. It's beautiful, but

334
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,080
it was a shadow. And so Christ has come and Christ has fulfilled the law, and

335
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,240
these folks are judging and they're bringing their judgment, and Paul says,

336
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,960
let no man therefore judge you. Notice what the Bible says in Romans chapter

337
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,000
number 14 with regard to this truth of this last phrase there in verse number

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,640
16 with regard to the trap of legalism. And in Romans chapter number 14, in verse

339
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,840
number 5, many still turning, give you a moment there, Romans 14 and verse number

340
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
5. I learned something on Wednesday night in the message. Actually, I learned

341
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,040
many things in the message. I've enjoyed the study through Psalm 23, but I heard

342
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,799
someone say, hey, don't start reading until I get there. And then my dad used

343
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,720
what Brother Ken Sparks used during the youth rally, say amen when you get there.

344
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,720
And the problem is some people are gonna get there faster than other people, but

345
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,480
the reality is that I'm thankful. It's always good to hear the pages of God's

346
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,080
Word turning, amen. I'm mindful when I hear that of the people, some of our

347
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,239
missionaries that we support, that they can't say to their folks, take your Bible

348
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,960
and turn to, because they don't have Bibles. Side note, back to Romans 14, verse

349
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,280
number 5. Notice what he says, one man esteemeth one day above another, another

350
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,920
esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. And

351
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,320
again, dealing with the transitional nature. Listen, the reality is that the

352
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,359
Sabbath was a sign for the Jews. It was a specific instruction that

353
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,239
was given to the Jews as a nation, the nation of Israel. And we understand that

354
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:52,520
as you study the book of Hebrews, and we did that last year, and you understand

355
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,720
the Sabbath of rest that we have, that rest in Christ. And what a blessing to

356
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,239
have that rest in the Lord Jesus Christ.

357
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,939
He is Christ.

358
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,779
And we find here that these folks

359
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,939
were coming in and they were judging

360
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,879
and they were dealing with

361
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,999
these new believers

362
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,259
and they were seeking to trap them

363
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:17,259
in legalism.

364
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,579
I want to share a few additional verses of Scripture

365
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,879
with you while you're here

366
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,059
in Romans 14.

367
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,719
Look, if you will, at verse 13.

368
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,359
It says,

369
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,639
"...let us not therefore judge one another any more,

370
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,239
but judge this rather,

371
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,999
that no man put a stumbling block

372
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:34,999
for an occasion to fall in his brother's way."

373
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,899
And this really is a great segue verse

374
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,099
to what Paul deals with

375
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,799
with the believers in Corinth

376
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,599
with regard to the subject of becoming

377
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,199
a stumbling block.

378
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,939
And the reality in which this could be,

379
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:48,039
especially in this first century

380
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,699
within the church

381
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,399
and all of the transitional nature

382
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:52,799
of that which was going on,

383
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,839
it was very possible for those

384
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,079
to engage in behavior

385
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,839
that could potentially be a stumbling block.

386
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,599
Look over, if you will,

387
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,599
1 Corinthians 8.

388
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,499
Notice here what Paul says

389
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,199
to this church in Corinth.

390
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,999
Now, the church in Corinth

391
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,499
had lots of difficulties.

392
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,199
And they were, of course,

393
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,099
dealing with many attacks

394
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,799
and there was division and discord

395
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,099
within the members,

396
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,599
within the ranks of the church.

397
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,299
And Paul is seeking to give them instruction

398
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,599
and seeking to help them

399
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,799
and calling them to spiritual maturity

400
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,999
and growth.

401
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,099
He says this in 1 Corinthians 8,

402
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,899
beginning in verse 8,

403
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:35,699
"...but meat commendeth us not to God.

404
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:39,199
For neither if we eat are we the better,

405
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:43,699
neither if we eat not are we the worse.

406
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:46,599
But take heed, lest by any means

407
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,199
this liberty of yours

408
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,399
become a stumbling block to them

409
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,199
that are weak.

410
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,899
For if any man see thee

411
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,499
which hast knowledge,

412
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,199
he that eateth meat in the idol's temple

413
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,999
shall not the conscience of him

414
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,599
which is weak be emboldened

415
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,399
to eat those things which are offered to idols?

416
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,799
And through thy knowledge

417
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,399
shall the weak brother perish

418
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,999
for whom Christ died.

419
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:10,999
But when ye sin so against the brethren

420
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,599
and wound their weak conscience,

421
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,099
ye sin against Christ.

422
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,799
Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend..."

423
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,799
Notice what Paul says,

424
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,699
"...I'll eat no flesh while the world standeth,

425
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:23,199
lest I make my brother to offend."

426
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,699
So there's this aspect that Paul deals with

427
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:26,999
and really in the first century here

428
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,599
dealing with this subject of stumbling block

429
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,099
and not causing others to be offended

430
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:32,999
and so on and so forth,

431
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,699
understanding some that are weak in Christ

432
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,399
and they're babes in Christ

433
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,999
and trying to help them and encourage them

434
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,399
and bring them along in their spiritual journey

435
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,699
and their growth and their walk with Christ.

436
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,899
And we find that Paul deals with this subject

437
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,099
and really the idea of becoming a stumbling block.

438
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:52,599
He gives further information to this.

439
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,699
We mentioned already in Romans,

440
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,399
but look in 1 Corinthians 10,

441
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,099
just turn over a few pages if you will.

442
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,699
Notice the way that he mentions it here

443
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:03,099
in verse number 23 of 1 Corinthians 10.

444
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,399
I believe that this was a life principle

445
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,199
that helped guide decisions not only for Paul,

446
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:11,099
but perhaps as we would implement in our lives as well.

447
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:11,999
It would be helpful.

448
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:12,899
Look at what he says,

449
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,299
"...all things are lawful for me,

450
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,599
but all things are not expedient."

451
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,899
All things are lawful for me,

452
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,299
but all things edify not.

453
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,099
And just having that understanding

454
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,499
and that awareness of how the actions

455
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,899
that we may engage in would affect,

456
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:30,299
impact someone else,

457
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,099
especially with regard to a younger believer.

458
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,899
And so we find that Paul gives much truth

459
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,299
within the Word of God

460
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,599
with regard to the liberty that we have,

461
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,799
with regard to the way in which Christ has set us free.

462
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,599
We're not to use our liberty as an occasion to the flesh.

463
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,999
He deals with that in Galatians chapter number five.

464
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,699
But we understand that these individuals,

465
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,799
these legalists,

466
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,499
and he's speaking of this trap of legalism here

467
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,699
and this dependence of moral law.

468
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,299
You understand the law cannot save.

469
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,499
If the law could save,

470
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,399
Paul deals with that in Galatians as well.

471
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,699
If the law could save,

472
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,299
if righteousness came by the law,

473
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,599
then Christ is dead and vain.

474
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,399
Amen?

475
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,199
And so the law cannot save.

476
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,799
It's the law that condemns.

477
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,199
It's the law that says,

478
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,599
guilty.

479
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,099
And so they're saying,

480
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,799
we're going to follow these moral laws

481
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:22,699
as opposed to this dependence

482
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,599
or this understanding of this personal faith

483
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,699
in the finished work of Jesus Christ

484
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,299
on the cross of Calvary.

485
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:30,699
Peter makes an interesting claim,

486
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,099
and you don't need to turn there,

487
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,500
but it's interesting because

488
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,599
some of these false teachers

489
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,099
and really all of them to a degree

490
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,299
have this focus

491
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,099
as we'll look at these three traps this morning.

492
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:44,099
But Peter says this,

493
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,799
while they promise them liberty,

494
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000
they themselves are the servants of corruption.

495
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,299
You know, there are false teachers who say,

496
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,199
well, if you do this,

497
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,099
it's going to bring this level of liberty.

498
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,899
It's going to bring this level of awareness

499
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,699
and knowledge and so on and so forth.

500
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:58,699
And Peter says, listen,

501
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,000
they promise liberty,

502
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,500
but they themselves are the servants of corruption.

503
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,000
We find that we must be grounded

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,199
upon the truth of the Word of God.

505
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,299
Avoid the trap of legalism.

506
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,399
This false teaching fails to recognize

507
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,099
that the Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled the law.

508
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,500
It fails to recognize the fact

509
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,199
that what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary

510
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:28,000
was sufficient to pay for the sin of mankind.

511
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,199
Listen, you can't help Christ pay your sin debt.

512
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,000
Amen?

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,399
By the way, you ought to be happy about that.

514
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,500
He didn't pay a portion and say the rest is up to you.

515
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,099
No, no. He said, it is finished.

516
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,399
It is finished.

517
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,599
And we are complete in Him.

518
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,399
What a wonderful truth of the Word of God.

519
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,799
The trap of legalism, number one.

520
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,899
Number two, the trap of mysticism.

521
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:53,099
The trap of mysticism.

522
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,799
We see this in verses 18 and 19.

523
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,899
And really, these mystics,

524
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:58,299
they would have this idea

525
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,899
that spiritual apprehension of knowledge

526
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,399
is inaccessible to the intellect,

527
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,899
that it may be obtained

528
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,399
or it must be attained

529
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,899
through contemplation and self-surrender.

530
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,099
And it's very interesting

531
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,599
when you think about mysticism

532
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,899
and obviously some of that which still exists today

533
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,699
and even here in the first century.

534
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:21,399
We find what it talks about here in verse 18 in particular

535
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:23,399
how that they intrude into those things

536
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,000
which He hath not seen,

537
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,199
vainly puffed up by His fleshly mind

538
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,000
and this mystic kind of perspective.

539
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And notice what Paul says to begin verse 18

540
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,399
just as he began verse 16,

541
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,399
let no man therefore judge you.

542
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,000
Notice what he says here in verse 18,

543
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,599
let no man beguile you of your reward.

544
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,399
And it says in a voluntary humility

545
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,500
and worshiping of angels.

546
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,599
But think about that phrase,

547
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,099
let no man beguile you of your reward.

548
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:52,299
The idea of this particular word,

549
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:53,799
it's interesting, it's only used here,

550
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,000
this Greek word is only used here in verse 18.

551
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,399
We find that the English word beguile

552
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,199
is used in verse 4 of our text of Scripture,

553
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,500
but it's a different Greek word

554
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,399
with just a slightly different meaning.

555
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,799
But here the idea of this word beguile

556
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,799
is to defraud or beguile of the prize of victory.

557
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,000
Really, he says beguile you of your reward

558
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,599
in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels.

559
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,299
Intruding, notice what he says,

560
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,399
into those things which he hath not seen,

561
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:26,000
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.

562
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,699
They begin to talk about these things.

563
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:30,099
They begin to speak about the way

564
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,000
in which they've attained some level

565
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,799
of spiritual awareness and knowledge

566
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,199
because of that which they have engaged in.

567
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,000
He speaks here in verse 18

568
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,099
of this worshiping of angels.

569
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:43,000
You understand that angels are mentioned

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,699
all throughout the Word of God,

571
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,799
but never, never are angels to be worshiped.

572
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,299
Not one time in all of the Word of God

573
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,500
are you to worship angels.

574
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,599
Never.

575
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,199
You're not to worship angels. Why?

576
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,799
Because you worship God.

577
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,500
You worship God.

578
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,000
There's no worshiping of angels.

579
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,199
In fact, as you read throughout the Word of God

580
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,699
and you read of angels and you read of their ministry

581
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,099
and their ministering servants

582
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,299
and so on and so forth,

583
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,500
and we're so thankful for the ministry of angels

584
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,199
that God in His knowledge created in angels,

585
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,599
that they are created beings.

586
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,500
He is the Creator.

587
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,899
He created these angels,

588
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:26,199
and you find that angels worship God.

589
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,699
They don't receive worship.

590
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,199
Remember reading the book of Revelation

591
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,000
and John is going to worship?

592
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,899
No, no, no, no!

593
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,799
Worship God!

594
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,700
Amen.

595
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,599
He is worthy of our worship.

596
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,399
This thing of worshiping angels,

597
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,899
in fact, some of them they would seek

598
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:46,299
to have really this idea of this contemplation

599
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,700
and self-surrender and it says there

600
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,000
that they're vainly puffed up by this fleshly mind,

601
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,099
but it also says this voluntary humility.

602
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,399
They almost have this perspective

603
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,799
that we're not good enough to worship God,

604
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,899
so we're going to start by worshiping angels.

605
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,299
And they would try to convince people

606
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:06,799
to engage in this worshiping of angels.

607
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,599
We're not to worship angels.

608
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,700
Never has it been commanded in the Word of God

609
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,899
to worship angels.

610
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,799
And we finally begin to get into this

611
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,200
really dangerous situation.

612
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,399
You're on dangerous ground

613
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,799
when you get into this mysticism stuff.

614
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,099
And we find that they get into this

615
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,899
and they begin to, as it says,

616
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,500
that they intrude into those things

617
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,700
which they know not.

618
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,399
Why is it, if we would begin to think about

619
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,099
the failure on the part of the mystics

620
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,399
in this idea of mysticism,

621
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,799
I believe that the answer is given to us

622
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,500
in verse 19 as to why,

623
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,099
where they've gone astray,

624
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,299
where they've missed it.

625
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,399
We said of the legalists

626
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,899
that they missed understanding

627
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,700
that Christ and His payment was sufficient.

628
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,399
Here in this text of Scripture,

629
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,700
thinking about mystics,

630
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,899
where they missed it

631
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,700
is that they failed to put Christ

632
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
in His proper position.

633
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,399
Notice verse 19.

634
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:58,899
It says,

635
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:01,799
and not holding the head.

636
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,299
Is that?

637
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,379
the capital in your Bible?

638
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:05,359
Why?

639
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,019
Because speaking of Christ,

640
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,359
do you remember what Paul said

641
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,359
back in chapter 1?

642
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,359
It might be on the same page for you.

643
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,859
It's a page different for me.

644
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:14,119
But look back if you will.

645
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,599
Remember the great discourse

646
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,119
that Paul gives in Colossians 1

647
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,419
on exalting the Lord Jesus Christ.

648
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,039
And he says in v. 15,

649
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,579
who is the image of the invisible God,

650
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:27,339
the firstborn of every creature.

651
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,239
For by Him were all things created

652
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,239
that are in heaven, that are in earth,

653
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,379
visible and invisible,

654
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,079
whether they be thrones or dominions

655
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,739
or principalities or powers.

656
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,459
All things were created by Him and for Him.

657
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:41,219
And He, Christ, is before all things

658
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,819
and by Him all things consist.

659
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:47,059
And He is the head of the body,

660
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,859
the church, who is the beginning,

661
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:52,299
the firstborn from the dead,

662
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:53,739
that in all things,

663
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:57,339
He might have the preeminence.

664
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:59,339
You understand that the Lord Jesus Christ

665
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:00,919
when He gave the promise to Peter

666
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,059
with regard to the church,

667
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,659
He said, I will build My church

668
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,779
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

669
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,939
Why did He make the statement that way?

670
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,059
Because it's His church.

671
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:11,979
He's the head of it.

672
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,659
Paul deals with this here in Colossians.

673
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,699
He deals with it in other portions of Scripture.

674
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,499
He deals with the believers in Ephesus.

675
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:18,899
And we understand the truth

676
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,499
of the headship of the Lord Jesus Christ

677
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,299
that He is the head.

678
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,099
Listen, when you don't have Christ

679
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,499
in His proper position,

680
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:29,099
things get messed up.

681
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,799
Not only in church, but in your life.

682
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,079
In your home. Right?

683
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,599
Christ has to have that proper position.

684
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,399
We had wall art in our home

685
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,679
in Manassas where it said

686
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,559
Christ is the head of our home.

687
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,919
And He is.

688
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,999
And we understand that He's the head of the church.

689
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:50,839
Notice it says,

690
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,959
"...and not holding the head,

691
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,599
from which all the body..."

692
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,279
Remember, the church is represented

693
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,479
in the book of 1 Corinthians, Romans as well,

694
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,139
"...as being a body of believers,

695
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,139
from which all the body, by joints and bands,

696
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,099
having nourishment, ministered,

697
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,659
and knit together,

698
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,499
increases with the increase of God."

699
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,059
Listen, when we worship God

700
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,139
as we're supposed to,

701
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,459
when we have the Lord Jesus Christ

702
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,259
in His proper position,

703
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:18,899
as He is entitled to,

704
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,859
we find that He provides us

705
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:23,239
with everything we need.

706
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,899
We don't need to intrude into these things

707
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,459
that they know not of.

708
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,259
We don't need to get into this mysticism

709
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,719
kind of a situation.

710
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,839
And you begin to think about these

711
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,159
that have experienced and they've dabbled

712
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,119
in some of this mysticism kind of stuff,

713
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,119
and they begin to talk about,

714
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,679
well, you have this experience,

715
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:40,519
and you begin to look at some maybe

716
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,119
of the charismatic type movements

717
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,599
that would be fallen into these traps of mysticism,

718
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,679
and they begin to have this perspective

719
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,319
of unless you experience the same thing

720
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,479
that I've experienced,

721
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:56,079
then you've not attained some level of spirituality.

722
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,099
But if I'm complete in Him,

723
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,919
what does complete mean?

724
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,919
Are there more levels of spiritual attaining?

725
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,899
No, I'm complete.

726
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,699
Yes, it's true that I'm to be sanctified,

727
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,179
and I'm to be walking with Him,

728
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,899
and I can be closer to Him as I abide in Him,

729
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,619
but there's not this mysticism kind of stuff

730
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,299
that's going on.

731
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,339
I shared the illustration many years ago,

732
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,699
but I remember knocking on a door

733
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,179
and giving an invitation,

734
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,939
trying to share the Gospel with an individual

735
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,239
as I was out door knocking,

736
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,199
and as I was door knocking on that particular day,

737
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,319
I think Juliana was actually with me.

738
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,199
It was many, many years ago,

739
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,419
and we think, and she was just real young,

740
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,559
and this lady answered the door,

741
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,219
began to have a conversation with her,

742
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,599
and she said something like this.

743
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,279
I asked her if she knew for sure that heaven was home,

744
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,039
and she said, absolutely.

745
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,759
And now, you don't get that too often

746
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,079
when you go door knocking,

747
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,019
and with that level of certainty, right?

748
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,719
And I said, man, that's wonderful.

749
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,299
Can you tell me how, I mean, when'd you get saved?

750
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,859
How do you know for sure heaven's your home?

751
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:05,379
And without any hesitation and 100% convinced,

752
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,199
she said this, I've spoken in tongues.

753
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:11,259
That was her answer.

754
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,139
And then she said this,

755
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,219
are you sure that you're going to heaven?

756
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,799
And I said, yes, ma'am.

757
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,500
And she said, oh yeah, when did you speak in tongues?

758
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:23,659
That was her measuring rod.

759
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,159
That was her standard by which you determine salvation.

760
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,759
Now, how does that work with the Word of God?

761
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:31,940
It doesn't work.

762
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,479
And the reality this morning

763
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:40,000
is that this mysticism stuff is dangerous.

764
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,720
Notice the danger here that Paul mentions

765
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,799
in 2 Corinthians 11.

766
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:45,959
Keep your place here in Colossians.

767
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,139
We'll get back there in just a moment,

768
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,679
but I want you to really see

769
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,879
the depth of the danger of this mysticism.

770
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,039
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 11,

771
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,899
Paul says this in verse number 13,

772
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:06,139
for such are false apostles.

773
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,759
Again, we're talking about false teachers.

774
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:10,479
We're talking about the traps of false teaching.

775
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,519
Paul deals with three of them in Colossae

776
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,479
that were prevalent, legalism.

777
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,399
Now we're looking at mysticism.

778
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,919
Notice what he says here in verse 13

779
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:21,979
of 2 Corinthians 11, for such are false apostles,

780
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,959
deceitful workers, transforming themselves

781
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,119
into the apostles of Christ.

782
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,000
But notice verse 14, in no marvel,

783
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,879
for Satan himself is transformed

784
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:41,119
into an angel of light.

785
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,579
Therefore, it is no great thing

786
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,019
if his ministers also be transformed

787
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,440
as the ministers of righteousness

788
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:53,419
whose end shall be according to their works.

789
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,699
That's a grave warning, is it not?

790
00:35:55,699 --> 00:36:00,019
The dangers of mysticism are serious.

791
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:03,019
And we find here that as we would understand

792
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,479
the truth of the word of God,

793
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,379
and we'd understand that as we look

794
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:08,899
at this passage of Scripture,

795
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,619
and we see the danger that Paul speaks of

796
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:14,179
with even Satan himself transforming himself

797
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,659
into an angel of light, here's the catch.

798
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,519
Here's the truth of the word of God

799
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,679
is that John says this in 1 John 4,

800
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,079
Beloved, believe not every spirit,

801
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,919
but try the spirits, whether they are of God,

802
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:34,079
because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

803
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,919
And then he says this,

804
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,819
Hereby I know you the Spirit of God.

805
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,119
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ

806
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,940
is come in the flesh is of God.

807
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,879
Where do they err?

808
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:47,199
They err with regard to the person of Christ.

809
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,759
And we find here that these mystics,

810
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,759
they fail to put Christ in his proper position

811
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,000
as being the head.

812
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,299
And Paul warns the believers in Corinth

813
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,839
that listen, don't marvel at this.

814
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,319
It's not a great thing if his ministers

815
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,079
transform as the ministers of righteousness.

816
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,440
And so be careful.

817
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,399
And John says, listen, we need to try the spirits.

818
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,279
Believe not every spirit.

819
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,199
Try the spirits.

820
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,720
How do we try them?

821
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,079
The word of God.

822
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,139
Remember what I say in the beginning,

823
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:25,979
the answer to error is always truth.

824
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:29,639
Why did the believers in Berea get commended?

825
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,479
Who knows?

826
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,319
Why were they commended?

827
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,959
Mark?

828
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,359
They searched the Scriptures daily.

829
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,559
Who was preaching to them?

830
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,239
The apostles.

831
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,399
And they're searching,

832
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:44,079
and they're trying to find out, is this true?

833
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,000
Listen, the work of the Bereans,

834
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
the work of us as a believer,

835
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,619
Paul says this, that we're to be students

836
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:52,459
of the word of God.

837
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:55,159
Study to show thyself approved unto God.

838
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,000
A workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

839
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,159
rightly dividing the word of truth.

840
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:02,099
Listen, we need to be settled and grounded

841
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,659
in the word of God.

842
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,720
And when these mystics and their approach

843
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,239
that is given here in chapter 2, verse 18,

844
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,199
with regard to that which they were engaging in,

845
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,359
it was important that you try the spirits.

846
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,119
And that you beware.

847
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,879
Let no man beguile you of your reward.

848
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:27,279
I'm thankful that Christ is the head of the church.

849
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,159
I'm thankful when you think about legalism

850
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,239
that Christ's atonement,

851
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,640
that His payment on the cross of Calvary

852
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,299
is sufficient for the sin debt of mankind.

853
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:39,940
And He's the head of the church.

854
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,140
Danger number three, verses 20 through 23,

855
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,459
it's the trap of asceticism.

856
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:49,219
Asceticism is a severe self-discipline

857
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:52,299
and evidence of all forms of indulgence

858
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:54,700
for religious reasons.

859
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,219
In your mind, as you think about the one

860
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:01,599
that would be really taken up in this trap of asceticism,

861
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,059
you would think about a monk.

862
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:07,500
But you know, you can never deal with the flesh

863
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,099
with the flesh.

864
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,679
It doesn't work.

865
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,399
And so sometimes these monks,

866
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,539
they try to go to these monasteries

867
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,219
and they're gonna get away from everything that's evil.

868
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,159
But they take their flesh to where they're going.

869
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,000
And guess what?

870
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,059
The flesh is at enmity with the spirit.

871
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,859
Is that not what the book of Galatians says

872
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,239
in the fifth chapter?

873
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,719
And so the reality is that if our flesh

874
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,599
is at enmity with the spirit,

875
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,260
we can get rid of every toy and every gadget

876
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,260
and everything and go to some secluded place,

877
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,979
but I take my flesh with me.

878
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:44,580
I take my flesh with me.

879
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,539
And so before long, I'm gonna have all kinds of problems.

880
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:50,619
Right?

881
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,459
Because we've got our flesh.

882
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,599
And it's at enmity with the spirit.

883
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:59,979
I believe that as we look at these verses of scripture

884
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:02,380
that the failure on the part of

885
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,740
of these that would be in the trap of asceticism

886
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,640
is that they fail to recognize

887
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,580
what our position is in Christ.

888
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,220
And really, when there's a failure

889
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,380
to understand our position in Christ,

890
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,420
it leads to being enslaved.

891
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,760
It leads to being enslaved.

892
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,580
Paul says this, and you don't need to turn there,

893
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,880
but just a reminder as we begin to look at these verses,

894
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,820
that Paul says this in Galatians 5, verse 1,

895
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,960
stand fast therefore in the liberty

896
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,440
wherewith Christ hath made us free,

897
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,280
and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

898
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,000
Listen, if I've been made free,

899
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,920
if I've been set free by the truth,

900
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,240
why do I wanna be in bondage again?

901
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,220
And here it's this failure of recognizing

902
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,680
what our position is in Christ.

903
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,700
Notice how he begins verse number 20.

904
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,160
In verse number 16 and 18,

905
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,520
when he talks about these first two traps,

906
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,420
he says, let no man therefore judge you.

907
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,100
Let no man beguile you.

908
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,140
But notice how he begins verse number 20.

909
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ

910
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,980
from the rudiments of the world,

911
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,340
why, as though living in the world,

912
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,940
are you subject to ordinances?

913
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,860
If you are in Christ, if you be dead with Christ,

914
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,780
if you have been, notice the reference really,

915
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,300
I believe, is back to the text that we studied last week

916
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,980
in verses 11 through 15,

917
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,800
when he talks about the way in which we were quick

918
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,760
and we were made alive and what Christ did for us

919
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,340
on the cross of Calvary.

920
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,820
There's a reference, no doubt,

921
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,440
when he talks about ye be dead with Christ

922
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,120
from the rudiments of the world.

923
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,280
Remember, it was back in verse number eight

924
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,520
of Colossians 2 that Paul says,

925
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,320
beware lest any man spoil you

926
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,560
through philosophy and vain deceit

927
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,880
after the tradition of men,

928
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,480
after the rudiments of the world,

929
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,440
and not after Christ.

930
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,860
And so Paul says, listen, if you're dead with Christ

931
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,300
from the rudiments of the world,

932
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,900
why, as though living in the world,

933
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,220
are you subject to these ordinances?

934
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,380
Now, it's also interesting when he mentions

935
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,860
this word ordinances at the end of verse number 20,

936
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,260
it makes my mind circle back to what we read

937
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,040
in verse number 14 last Sunday morning,

938
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,300
where the Bible says blotting out

939
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,740
the handwriting of ordinances that was against us.

940
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,660
And it was against us.

941
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,440
You read the law, guilty, right?

942
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,320
Just don't even read all of the law,

943
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,520
the 630 plus aspects of the law,

944
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,220
just read the 10 commandments.

945
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,600
Which one among us could stand up and say,

946
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,040
I've kept them all?

947
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,480
No.

948
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,720
And Jesus says, listen, we talk about thou shalt not kill.

949
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,200
Jesus says, if you hate your brother,

950
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
it's like you killed him.

951
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

952
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,139
If you think upon a woman to lust after her,

953
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,559
you've committed adultery in your mind.

954
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,500
Well, that takes it to a whole nother level.

955
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,340
Does it not?

956
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,980
Seriously.

957
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,340
It's not, I didn't do the act.

958
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,720
Okay, Jesus comes along and makes sure

959
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,580
we're all understanding that we're condemned.

960
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,180
Right?

961
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,020
So there's only one word when we stand up against the law.

962
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,139
Guilty.

963
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:19,460
But Jesus, thank God for what he did

964
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,900
on the cross of Calvary.

965
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,440
He blotted out the handwriting of ordinances

966
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,040
that was against us, which was contrary to us,

967
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,120
and he took it out of the way,

968
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,360
nailing it to his cross.

969
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
And so therefore, Paul says, listen,

970
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,880
if you've been born again, if you're a child of God,

971
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,919
why are you gonna be subject to these ordinances?

972
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,460
And then he kind of lists them.

973
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,700
Touch not, taste not, handle not,

974
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,919
which all are to perish with the using.

975
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,639
Notice the end of verse number 22.

976
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,760
After the commandments and doctrines of who?

977
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,580
Men.

978
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,580
Men.

979
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,460
Not after God, but after men.

980
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,139
You know, the Pharisees.

981
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:01,540
Man, they were a fine group of people, were they not?

982
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,380
Whew.

983
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,820
Vipers.

984
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,279
I mean, Jesus went after those guys.

985
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,139
They had so many man-made additions

986
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,080
to what God had already said in his word,

987
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,200
they couldn't fulfill what they were trying

988
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,700
to make other people fulfill.

989
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,540
And here we find that Paul says this trap of asceticism,

990
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,339
that this severe self-discipline

991
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:33,580
and this avoidance of all forms of indulgence

992
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,020
for these religious reasons

993
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,880
that it's going to take you to some level

994
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,619
of attaining some spirituality

995
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,380
that could be attained no other way,

996
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,660
be careful of that trap, why?

997
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,779
Because you're complete in Christ.

998
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:48,660
You're complete in Him.

999
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:53,700
Verse 23, it says this,

1000
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,660
which things have indeed a show of wisdom

1001
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,820
and will worship and humility and neglecting of the body,

1002
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,480
not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.

1003
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,820
You think about those same people

1004
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,779
that I mentioned a moment ago, those Pharisees,

1005
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:08,059
and how did they pray?

1006
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:11,220
Man, they wanted everybody to hear them pray, right?

1007
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,059
What did they do when they fasted?

1008
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:15,140
Hey, listen, Ryan, just so you know, I'm fasting today,

1009
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,880
so just, I just want to make you know that.

1010
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,320
Don't invite me to go to lunch with you

1011
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:19,779
because I'm fasting today.

1012
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,020
What did Jesus say?

1013
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,980
You have your reward.

1014
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,380
What's the reward?

1015
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,140
The praise of men.

1016
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,640
Did you hear them pray?

1017
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,420
Did you hear their fasting again?

1018
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,580
You have your reward.

1019
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,500
It's the praise of men.

1020
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,940
This idea of these, a show of wisdom and will worship

1021
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,839
and humility, neglecting the body.

1022
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,239
Remember, when the Pharisee and the Publican were praying,

1023
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,279
what's the Pharisee?

1024
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,179
I thank God that I'm not like him.

1025
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:58,320
Is that not what the Word of God tells us?

1026
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:00,119
The Publican.

1027
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,540
He said, have mercy, I'm a sinner.

1028
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,399
And so we see here this morning

1029
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:13,040
that as we look at these three traps

1030
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,679
that were prevalent here for the believers in Colossae,

1031
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,260
the trap of legalism, the trap of mysticism,

1032
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,179
the trap of asceticism,

1033
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:24,739
that in each of these particular situations

1034
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:25,679
that they would deal with,

1035
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,260
they needed to have truth given to them.

1036
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,899
And they needed to understand that we must keep Christ

1037
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:33,700
in his proper place.

1038
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,260
Listen, the truth of legalism there

1039
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,040
when he talks about a shadow of things to come,

1040
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,459
but the body is of Christ.

1041
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:45,700
I'm thankful that we have the real thing,

1042
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,520
not just a shadow.

1043
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,800
How many of you have ever seen a shadow?

1044
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
You know what a shadow is, right?

1045
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,040
So let's just use, Michael, you're sitting up here,

1046
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,279
and James and Wyatt, and Alice is too little for this,

1047
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,480
but you're walking out this evening,

1048
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,420
and James or Wyatt, they see your shadow.

1049
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,720
Why do they see your shadow?

1050
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,279
Because you're there.

1051
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:09,200
Now what kind of sense would it make for James or Wyatt

1052
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,279
to go try to hug the shadow

1053
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,119
if dad is right there?

1054
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,920
Right?

1055
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,320
I'm not chasing the shadow of the law.

1056
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,600
It was a shadow of good things to come,

1057
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,239
and it pointed to Christ, but Christ has come,

1058
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,119
and he's our savior.

1059
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,880
And we understand that he is sufficient,

1060
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,559
that he satisfied all of the demands

1061
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,320
to pay for the sin of mankind.

1062
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,300
Listen, he's the head.

1063
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,200
He is the head.

1064
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,800
And in all things, he must have the preeminence.

1065
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,119
We gotta keep him in his rightful place.

1066
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:49,959
And if we don't have him in his rightful place,

1067
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:51,320
things get messed up.

1068
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,720
We find here with the last truth,

1069
00:47:56,459 --> 00:48:00,959
they fail to recognize what our position is in Christ.

1070
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:03,520
I'm so thankful to be a child of God,

1071
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,920
adopted in the family of God,

1072
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,720
to be joint heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ,

1073
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,920
to understand that I have reserved in heaven for me

1074
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,820
an inheritance that's incorruptible, undefiled.

1075
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,020
It fadeth not away.

1076
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,500
It's reserved in heaven for me.

1077
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,459
What a blessing to know that any time

1078
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:29,100
I can go directly into the throne room of God

1079
00:48:30,899 --> 00:48:32,480
because of Jesus Christ,

1080
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,099
because of what he did for me, what he did for you.

1081
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:37,780
And this morning, we need to be careful

1082
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,820
of the traps of false teaching.

1083
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,799
I understand that they may vary for us today

1084
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:44,979
and dealing here with these in Colossae,

1085
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:48,320
but some of these traps that exist today,

1086
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,840
we need to be careful.

1087
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,520
We need to try the Spirit.

1088
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,440
Don't believe it.

1089
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,160
Well, he's a preacher and he's got this many followers.

1090
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,200
I mean, he must be right.

1091
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,440
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1092
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,760
Be careful.

1093
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,140
Be careful.

1094
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,979
We must grow in grace and the knowledge

1095
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:07,080
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

1096
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,260
And that growth comes through a proper walk with God.

1097
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,539
Yes, we're to abide with him, in him,

1098
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:15,820
and we're to walk with him.

1099
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,340
And yes, the word of God does give us instruction

1100
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,660
of things that please him and things that do not please him.

1101
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,179
But we understand that we are complete in him.

1102
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,700
And what a wonderful truth of the word of God.

1103
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,539
Let's pray together.

1104
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,340
Father, we love you.

1105
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,340
We thank you for loving us.

1106
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,140
We thank you for the word that you've given us,

1107
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,320
this precious Bible.

1108
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,280
And God, we thank you that you've given us truth.

1109
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,400
And even as we referenced earlier this morning

1110
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,700
of Romans 8, the truth shall make you free.

1111
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,280
I'm so thankful to have been given the freedom

1112
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,880
that Paul spoke of in Galatians chapter number five,

1113
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,760
and have no desire to be entangled again.

1114
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:10,520
and any kind of bondage, I pray that you'd help us to take heed to the

1115
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,760
warning and instruction that was given in this portion of Scripture for these

1116
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,320
believers, and to understand that today the false teachers are still prevalent,

1117
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,400
and they're still seeking to propagate their teachings, and they're still

1118
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:32,280
seeking to trap, to take captive as many as they can. Help us to know the truth, to

1119
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:39,320
stand for truth. If there's one that's been influenced and impacted by false

1120
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:46,000
teaching, at whatever level it may be, oh God, would you help them and deliver them

1121
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:55,160
from that at this very hour. Help us, God, to run to you and to your word. May it be

1122
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,280
that you have your rightful position in our lives, and that we

1123
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,160
understand that we are complete in you. If there's one that's not sure of heaven,

1124
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,720
they've never been saved, but yet they're in our midst today. They've not had that

1125
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,880
handwriting of ordinances that was against them. They've not had it blotted

1126
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,640
out. They've not had it nailed to the cross. They're still dead in their

1127
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:32,520
trespasses and sins. Oh Holy Spirit, we pray that you would convict of sin, of

1128
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,080
Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come. They would make a decision before

1129
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,520
they would leave this place, to place their faith and trust in the finished

1130
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:49,480
work of Christ at Calvary, understanding that today is the day of salvation. Help

1131
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,400
us, God, do a work in our lives, and we'll thank you for it. Would you stand with me?

1132
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,720
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the

1133
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,760
piano, and as she does, the altar is open. You can come to the old-fashioned altar,

1134
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,920
you can make your pew an altar, but as she plays, the altar is open. Let's allow

1135
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,320
God to have His way in our lives.
