1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
and Juliana's home from college, amen.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,019
And so thankful to have her home.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,739
She'll be leaving on Tuesday to head back.

4
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,899
And so if you'd pray for her over the next few weeks

5
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:11,260
as she finishes up, I know that she'd appreciate that.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,220
First Corinthians chapter 15.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,100
And this sounds a little weird to me.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,020
Does it sound weird to you?

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,940
It does sound weird to you.

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,379
It sounds weird to me up here.

11
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,659
So Jim, if you could try to help with that a little bit,

12
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,860
it just sounds a little echoey to me up here.

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,780
And some of the folks that it feels a little weird

14
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,500
to them as well, that sounds a whole lot better, amen.

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,200
And First Corinthians 15.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,319
And I am so thankful for the truth

17
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:34,880
that we serve a risen savior.

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
We've mentioned it many times already this morning

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,540
and it is worth repeating.

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,400
And he lives, he lives, amen.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,000
And one day, one glorious day, he is coming back.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,599
And I don't know the hour nor the day, and neither do you,

23
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,380
but the reality is that we're to listen for the trumpet.

24
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,220
Why?

25
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,759
Because Jesus is coming.

26
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,700
And I am so thankful for that precious truth.

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,919
Just as we read this morning in Matthew's gospel

28
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,520
when we had our morning outside service

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,720
at 7 a.m. this morning, there in Matthew's gospel,

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,360
he is not here, for he is risen as he said.

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,660
And the reality is that he is coming again.

32
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,500
Why?

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,319
Because he said he was.

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,680
He said, let not your heart be troubled.

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,440
You believe in God, believe also in me.

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,279
In my father's house are many mansions.

37
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,160
If it were not so, I would have told you.

38
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,559
I go to prepare a place for you.

39
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,319
And he said this, if I go and prepare a place for you,

40
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,940
I will come again and receive you unto myself

41
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,099
that where I am, there you may be also.

42
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,139
In John chapter 14 in verses one through three,

43
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,819
he then later said in that same passage,

44
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,139
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

45
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:43,139
No man cometh unto the father but by me.

46
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:47,500
I am so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ paid the price

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,779
for my sin and for your sin and for the sin of the world.

48
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,019
Amen?

49
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:56,620
And it is a tremendous blessing to know the truth

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
of God's word, to know the truth of redemption,

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,160
the plan of redemption that the Lord Jesus Christ

52
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,800
would come, that price would be his substitution

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,039
or atonement on the cross of Calvary.

54
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,520
Of course, he was buried and he rose,

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,080
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
And what a blessing.

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,279
I believe that each of us, many of us here this morning

58
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:18,639
would agree that the resurrection of Jesus Christ

59
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,899
is indeed the cornerstone of our faith.

60
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,520
In fact, in this passage of scripture

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,100
in 1 Corinthians 15, there were some that were saying

62
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,399
that there is no resurrection.

63
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,960
And Paul said if there's no resurrection,

64
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
then that means Christ is not risen.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,119
And if Christ is not risen, then your preaching is vain,

66
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,960
that our faith is vain.

67
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,759
But he announces and he proves with great just purpose

68
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,759
and great power that Christ indeed is risen from the dead.

69
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,820
Our faith is not in vain.

70
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,880
Our preaching is not in vain.

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Why?

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,800
Because we serve a risen savior.

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,320
And we meet on the first day of the week

74
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,660
because Jesus Christ rose,

75
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,539
conquering sin, death, and the grave

76
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,039
on the first day of the week.

77
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,860
We find that this passage of scripture

78
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,740
that is before us this morning really

79
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,220
is the classic, if you will, passage of scripture

80
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,800
that deals with the resurrection of our savior,

81
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,720
the Lord Jesus Christ.

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,740
As we've mentioned many times over the years,

83
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,699
there's false teachers that are recorded

84
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,679
in the word of God.

85
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,940
And we continue today to deal with false teaching.

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
It is a prevalent thing that will be

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,279
throughout the church age.

88
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,880
And we think about the false teaching,

89
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,880
and there was false teaching prevalent there in Corinth.

90
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,639
And some of these believers that had been given the truth

91
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,240
as the apostle Paul and his missionary journey

92
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,860
went and saw this church started,

93
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,199
there were some false teachers that came in.

94
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,699
And some of these false teachers were teaching

95
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,360
that Jesus had not risen from the dead.

96
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,199
And they had been influenced by these false teachers.

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,580
And so the Lord, through the apostle Paul,

98
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,580
he used Paul to encourage and to instruct

99
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,300
the believers at Corinth with regard to the resurrection.

100
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300
It's interesting in Acts 1 in verse number three,

101
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,199
the Bible begins in that passage of scripture

102
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,820
by speaking of the resurrection.

103
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,779
And it says that he, speaking of Christ,

104
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,699
showed himself alive after his passion

105
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,700
by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days

106
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,040
and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,140
We find that even in this passage of scripture

108
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,399
in 1 Corinthians 15, that Paul also speaks

109
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,880
of the evidence of Christ's resurrection,

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
and he declares it to be so with great authority.

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,839
I believe this morning that as we consider

112
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,839
the truth of the resurrection,

113
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,160
that we ought to consider the impact

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,320
that this truth has on the life of every believer.

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Because God has given us the truth of his word,

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,859
because he has revealed his nature, his character,

117
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,260
his attributes to us, it should impact us.

118
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,899
It should impact our behavior.

119
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,619
I've said many times over the years

120
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:01,700
that belief impacts behavior.

121
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,059
We sang as we were outside this morning,

122
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,660
one of the songs that we sang was Because He Lives.

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,700
And the songwriter said,

124
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,500
"'Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.'"

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,140
The songwriter said, "'Because he lives, all fear is gone,

126
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,119
"'because I know, I know that he holds the future

127
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,079
"'and life is worth the living.'"

128
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,920
Why?

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,559
"'Just because he lives.'"

130
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,619
And so this morning, I wanna preach a message to you

131
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,859
that's actually the same title as that song,

132
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,459
Because He Lives.

133
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,220
And when we think about the truth of the resurrection,

134
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,640
we would understand this morning

135
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,739
that it should have a great impact upon the people of God.

136
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:42,200
How has the reality of his resurrection impacted you?

137
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,399
That's the question as we go through

138
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,040
the portion of scripture this morning.

139
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,239
Notice in verse number one,

140
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,000
the apostle Paul begins by saying this,

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,540
"'Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel,

142
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,179
"'which I preached unto you, which also you have received,

143
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:03,320
"'and wherein ye stand, by which also you are saved,

144
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,380
"'if you keep in memory what I preached unto you,

145
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,359
"'unless you have believed in vain.

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,980
"'For I delivered unto you, first of all,

147
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,059
"'that which I also received,

148
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,760
"'how that Christ died for our sins,

149
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
"'according to the scriptures,

150
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,160
"'and that He was buried, and that He rose again

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,459
"'the third day, according to the scriptures,

152
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,500
"'and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve.

153
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,559
"'After that, He was seen of above 500 brethren at once,

154
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,359
"'of whom the greater part remain under this present,

155
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,899
"'but some are fallen asleep.

156
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,380
"'After that, He was seen of James,

157
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,640
"'then of all the apostles.

158
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,079
"'And last of all, He was seen of me also,

159
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,579
"'as of one born out of due time.'"

160
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,640
As we look at this passage of scripture this morning,

161
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
we're reminded that Paul was speaking

162
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,880
about the certainty, the reality of Christ's resurrection.

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,619
And notice in verses five through eight

164
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,820
how that he speaks of the reality of His resurrection.

165
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,880
He says that He was seen of Cephas, and then of the twelve.

166
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,619
And then he says this in verse number six,

167
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:07,619
that He was seen of above 500 brethren at once.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,760
And he says of that group of people that many of them,

169
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,059
of whom the greater part remain under this present.

170
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,459
In other words, they were still alive.

171
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,720
They had not yet died.

172
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,220
He does say at the end of the verse

173
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,019
that some are fallen asleep, some have died.

174
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,459
But many of that group, that 500,

175
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,519
they still were alive at the time of the writing

176
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,859
of 1 Corinthians chapter number 15.

177
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,459
We find that you continue,

178
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:32,839
and he speaks about James and the apostles.

179
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,339
But then Paul says this of himself in verse number eight.

180
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,380
And last of all, He was seen of me also

181
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,279
as of one born out of due time.

182
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:45,799
And I can understand that Paul is writing no doubt

183
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,739
about that experience as it's recorded in Acts nine.

184
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,420
And understanding that he too had the privilege

185
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,239
of seeing the resurrected Christ.

186
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,220
We begin to think about the resurrection

187
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,420
and begin to understand the impact

188
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,679
that it should have on our lives.

189
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,619
I would say this, number one, if you're taking notes,

190
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,619
because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

191
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,200
Because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

192
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Notice in the first few verses of our text of scripture,

193
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,920
the apostle Paul makes no bones about it.

194
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,640
He says to these believers,

195
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,679
he says, I declared unto you the gospel.

196
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,359
He speaks about the way in which he came to them

197
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,799
and he preached unto them,

198
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,380
and he preached to them the gospel.

199
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,179
What is the gospel?

200
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,359
The reality is that if there's no resurrection,

201
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,700
there's no gospel.

202
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,080
Because the reality is that the gospel in its entirety

203
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,760
is not simply the death of Jesus Christ

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
on the cross of Calvary,

205
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,039
nor is it just simply His death and His burial,

206
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,520
but it is the death, burial, and resurrection

207
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,760
of Jesus Christ that is the gospel.

208
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,440
It is the good news of Jesus Christ.

209
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,799
And we understand this morning,

210
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,119
as we think about the gospel,

211
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,200
that Paul, as he's speaking here,

212
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,320
he says to them in verse number three,

213
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,419
for I delivered unto you, first of all,

214
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,919
that which I also received.

215
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,200
Understand that Paul says, this is not my gospel.

216
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,940
If you were to read the book of Galatians

217
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,239
in the first chapter, you would find that Paul

218
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,640
makes it very clear that he is preaching

219
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,479
that which the Lord Jesus Christ

220
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,000
had delivered to him and given him.

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,119
In fact, he says this in Galatians one,

222
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,919
in verse number 11 and 12,

223
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,719
but I certify you, brethren,

224
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,900
that the gospel which was preached of me

225
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,840
is not after man, for I neither received it of man,

226
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
neither was I taught it,

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,799
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

228
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,799
And so Paul, as he's speaking here in 1 Corinthians 15

229
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,880
to these believers that had been influenced

230
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,840
by these false teachers, he says,

231
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,380
I want to remind you that I came in

232
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,440
and I preached to you.

233
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
I delivered unto you, first of all,

234
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
that which I also received,

235
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,640
how that Christ died for our sins,

236
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,320
according to the scriptures.

237
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,479
Let me say a few things about verse number three.

238
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:59,080
It's not just sufficient to say that Jesus died.

239
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,159
There was a reason.

240
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,799
And that reason is given to us in this verse of Scripture throughout the whole of God's

241
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,799
Word.

242
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,919
We find that the reason that Christ died is for our sins.

243
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,599
The Bible says how that Christ died for our sins.

244
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,919
Just grasp that just for a moment this morning.

245
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,739
A couple of weeks ago, we had a missionary last week, but two weeks ago I preached a

246
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:30,019
message on the sufferings of Jesus Christ and how that Peter said that he was a witness

247
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,959
of the sufferings of Christ.

248
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,719
And we understand this morning that he died for our sins.

249
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:42,279
You know that sin is a universal condition of mankind?

250
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,279
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

251
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,839
There's not a just man upon the face of the earth.

252
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,239
The only one to ever walk the face of this earth without sin is Jesus Christ himself,

253
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,059
God in flesh.

254
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,519
And so sin is a universal condition.

255
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,519
Every single one of us, we sang that song this morning about the, it's under the blood.

256
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,199
And the reality is that I'm so thankful this morning that I can say that yes, I'm a sinner,

257
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,959
but I'm a forgiven sinner.

258
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,959
It's under the blood.

259
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,359
I've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.

260
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:20,999
But we understand this morning that Jesus, he died specifically for your sin and for

261
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,819
my sin and for the sin of the world.

262
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,559
Why did he do that?

263
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:29,679
Because it was the only way that man could be reconciled to God.

264
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,999
Because man had sinned.

265
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,799
We find that the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter number three, how that sin entered

266
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,799
into the world.

267
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,799
And you understand the truth of Romans chapter number five, the Bible speaks about that as

268
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,759
sin entered in the world, that death also is the result.

269
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,879
And we understand that not simply physical death, but spiritual death.

270
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,359
Jesus is appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment.

271
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:02,299
And because of our sin, we need a savior.

272
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,919
Because of our sin, we need payment to be made.

273
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,219
And let me say this this morning, you can never pay for your sin.

274
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,619
And I could never pay for my sin.

275
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:15,659
The debt is a debt that we cannot pay.

276
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:21,239
The only payment that was accepted by God Almighty for the sin of mankind is the precious

277
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,319
blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

278
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,839
We are not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold received by tradition

279
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,839
from our fathers.

280
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:29,839
No, no.

281
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,919
We're not redeemed with those things.

282
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:37,759
We are redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without spot or blemish.

283
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,119
And we are rejoicing this morning that He died.

284
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,479
Why did He die?

285
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,619
For our sins.

286
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:47,999
And notice it says, according to the Scriptures.

287
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,279
I'm thankful for the Old Testament prophecies that prophesy not only of the coming of the

288
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,759
Lord Jesus Christ, but I'm thankful for the Old Testament prophecies that prophesy of

289
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,879
His sufferings on the cross of Calvary, that He would go to the cross and He would pay

290
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,959
that price for mankind.

291
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,459
Many today do not know the truth of the gospel.

292
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,319
They are going about trying to, maybe they've acknowledged their own sin problem, but maybe

293
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,439
they're trying to pay for their sin through some other means.

294
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,439
Maybe they think that if I could be a good enough person, if I could do enough good things,

295
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,799
then God will accept me.

296
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:31,359
Can I tell you on the authority of the Word of God, it's just not accepted payment.

297
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:37,919
All of our good works, the verse that Holly sang in that song, are as filthy rags, according

298
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,679
to what Isaiah tells us.

299
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,399
There's no way that you could ever pay for your sin, because the only payment that's

300
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,119
accepted is the blood of Jesus Christ.

301
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:53,839
And He died for our sins, and He died according to the Scriptures.

302
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,719
Notice in verse number 4, and that He was buried.

303
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:01,119
We can read the account, we see the record of the burial of the Lord Jesus Christ in

304
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,119
each of the gospels.

305
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,679
He was buried, I often say, in that borrowed tomb.

306
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,359
And He was buried in that borrowed tomb.

307
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:14,679
You remember Joseph of Arimathea, he comes to Pilate begging the body, and he and Nicodemus,

308
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,559
they go and they put Jesus in the tomb.

309
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,839
But then you notice in verse number 4, it says, and that He rose again the third day

310
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,599
according to the Scriptures.

311
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,199
I'm so thankful that He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

312
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,839
You see the phrase, according to the Scriptures, again, as you study the Old Testament, as

313
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:41,639
you study the prophecies concerning the substitutionary atonement, but also the glorious resurrection

314
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,739
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

315
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,419
And so because He lives, I will preach the gospel, because I know it's the gospel that

316
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,779
is the power of God to save sinners.

317
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,739
I know it was the gospel that changed my life.

318
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,739
Think about this.

319
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,699
Turn back, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 9.

320
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:04,019
Notice what the Apostle Paul says here, his testimony, as he's sharing with these believers

321
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,019
here in Corinth.

322
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:10,819
Notice what he says in 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 16.

323
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:15,179
In 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 16, he says, for though I preach the gospel, I have

324
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:23,019
nothing to glory of, for necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not

325
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,019
the gospel.

326
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:30,339
If you look over at verse number 23, notice what he says, and this I do for the gospel's

327
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,339
sake.

328
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:34,059
You see, Paul understood something about the gospel.

329
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:39,659
In Romans chapter number 1, the Word of God gives us some truth with regard to really

330
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,979
the perspective that Paul had with regard to preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.

331
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:51,019
And as he is giving this introductory statement to the believers there in Rome, in Romans

332
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,659
1, in verse number 1, he says, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,

333
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:03,099
notice what it says, separated unto the gospel of God, which He promised to for by His prophets

334
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:07,339
and the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, which was made of

335
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:13,099
the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,

336
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:18,099
according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.

337
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:27,099
And then notice in verse number 15, he says, so, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach

338
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:30,019
the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

339
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,419
What made Paul prepared and ready to preach the gospel?

340
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,419
It was that he understood that Christ lives.

341
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:41,099
And he says, because He lives, I'm going to preach the gospel.

342
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:45,499
You know, the reality is that we live in a world that's been blinded by the God of this

343
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,339
world, the little g God of this world, Satan.

344
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,139
He has blinded the minds of them that believe not.

345
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,699
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, God speaks about that very truth, about how the minds

346
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,459
of them that believe not, their minds have been blinded.

347
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:06,499
But notice that Paul says this in the same passage of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 4, in

348
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:15,899
verse number 3, he says, but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

349
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:21,939
He then says this in verse number 7, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the

350
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,459
excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.

351
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,759
You know the treasure that we have in earthen vessels?

352
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,339
It's the gospel, the Holy Spirit of God that lives within us, but the light of the glorious

353
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,359
gospel of Jesus Christ.

354
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:42,599
And he says, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

355
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,839
Who lights a candlestick and puts it under a bushel?

356
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,239
We sing with the kids, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, right?

357
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,239
And we tell them, don't let Satan blow it out.

358
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,719
We tell them, hide it under a bushel, no.

359
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:58,999
I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

360
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,719
And I preach the gospel, why?

361
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,719
Because he lives.

362
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:07,199
Listen, if Christ had not risen from the dead, as he says in this passage of Scripture in

363
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:15,919
1 Corinthians 15, there's no reason for us to preach if Christ be not risen.

364
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:23,079
But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,

365
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,399
according to 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 20.

366
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,799
And so because he lives, I will preach the gospel.

367
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,639
Let me say this, number two, if you're taking notes this morning, because he lives, I will

368
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:36,000
endure hardship.

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I will endure hardship.

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,440
You say, I like that first point.

371
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,799
Listen, this morning as we look at Paul's testimony and he's preaching to these people

372
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,879
in Corinth and he's speaking to them about the power of the resurrection and the truth

373
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:56,159
of the resurrection, I want you to look and skip ahead to verse number 20.

374
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,679
I've kind of referenced it twice, but he says, but now is Christ risen from the dead

375
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,879
and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

376
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:11,479
For since by man came death, by man also came also the resurrection of the dead.

377
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:16,119
As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

378
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,879
But every man in his own order, Christ the firstfruits, afterward they that are Christ

379
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:23,959
it is coming, then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God,

380
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:30,159
and the Father, when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

381
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,319
For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

382
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,679
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

383
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,079
And so Paul is giving the truth of the resurrected Christ and he's telling them about the power

384
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,679
of the resurrection.

385
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,239
But think about the impact, again, upon the people of God.

386
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:52,479
Notice in verse number 30, down through verse number 32, notice what Paul says, and why

387
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:58,799
stand we in jeopardy every hour?

388
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,199
He says this, I protest by...

389
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:06,439
rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."

390
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:12,759
We see in verse number 30 that he's speaking about this standing in jeopardy every hour.

391
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,839
He says in verse 31, I die daily.

392
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,319
Notice what he says in verse number 32, if after the manner of men I have fought with

393
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:28,639
beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the dead rise not?

394
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,839
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

395
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,819
Listen, if there's no resurrection, why am I going to endure hardship?

396
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,039
But because he lives, I will endure hardship.

397
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,759
I will understand that there's going to be times of difficulty.

398
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,079
The Bible says, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution,

399
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,919
and I will endure those hardships.

400
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:55,919
Why?

401
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,279
Because I know he lives.

402
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,959
And because he lives, because he conquered sin, death, and the grave, I will endure

403
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:02,959
that hardship.

404
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:08,199
Paul mentions specifically in verse number 32 the experience that he had at Ephesus.

405
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:12,439
We will not take the time to turn over to Acts 19 and see the record of that, but the

406
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:19,159
reality is that Paul is saying, what advantage do I have for enduring this hardship if the

407
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,719
dead rise not?

408
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:27,719
But the reason that I would endure this hardship is because I know that he lives, and I know

409
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,559
that I, too, will live.

410
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,519
I will be resurrected.

411
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:37,119
And because of that powerful truth, the impact of that truth on Paul and on every child of

412
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,979
God ought to be that we, too, would endure hardship.

413
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:46,599
This experience that he mentions there in Ephesus, he then follows it up with a statement

414
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,359
after he speaks about what advantage would there be.

415
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,319
He said, listen, if the dead rise not, then let us just follow this same thought.

416
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,619
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

417
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:05,199
If this world is all there really is, that's the motto to follow.

418
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,679
This world is not all that there is.

419
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,979
This is just temporary.

420
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,719
There's all of eternity.

421
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:16,159
To think about this morning the truth of what Paul is saying, it's very interesting because

422
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:23,999
it's very like to what Jesus said in Luke chapter number 12, in verse number 16-21,

423
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:28,759
the Lord Jesus Christ here in this passage of Scripture, there's a parable that is speaking,

424
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,959
and he talks about that certain rich man that brought forth plentifully.

425
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,199
Remember that text of Scripture?

426
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:39,199
And in Luke chapter number 12, he speaks of that, and he says this, he says of that one,

427
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:42,479
he says that he thought within himself, saying, what shall I do?

428
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,319
Because I have no room where to bestow my fruits.

429
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:49,119
He said, this will I do, I will pull down my barns and build a draider, and there will

430
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:56,119
I bestow all my fruits and all my goods, and I will say to my soul, soul, thou hast much

431
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:04,479
goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

432
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:15,439
But God said, but God said unto him, thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required

433
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:21,679
of thee, then who shall those things be which thou hast provided?

434
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,599
You think about this as we understand the truth of the resurrection as we celebrate

435
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:32,799
this morning the resurrected Christ and understand that He lives, I would say because He lives

436
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,599
I will endure hardship.

437
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,759
It's not an eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die.

438
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,679
That's not the philosophy of life, that's the philosophy of the world, that's not God's

439
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,359
philosophy from His book, and we study the Word of God and we understand, listen, I'm

440
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,839
going to endure hardship, I'm going to understand as Paul says that he was standing in jeopardy

441
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,839
every hour.

442
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,039
In fact, let me share with you what he says, turn to the book of 2 Corinthians if you will,

443
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:06,879
in chapter number 11, notice the list that Paul provides of the things that he endured.

444
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,479
Oftentimes as we think about the Apostle Paul, we study through the book of Acts and study

445
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:15,539
the epistles and we see a man that was fully surrendered to the Lord.

446
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:21,279
He was a man that was just sold out for Christ, so to speak, and he's living for the Lord,

447
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,159
but he's enduring hardship.

448
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,999
2 Corinthians 11, beginning in verse number 16, he says, I say again, let no man think

449
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:34,999
me a fool, if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that I may boast myself a little.

450
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:39,999
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence

451
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,239
of boasting.

452
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,559
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

453
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,519
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

454
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,959
But if ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take

455
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:59,879
of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face, I speak as concerning reproach,

456
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:01,879
as though we had been weak.

457
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:06,719
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, I speak foolishly, I am bold also.

458
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:11,239
So Paul is setting the scene in those first few verses to speak about how some of these

459
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:15,999
in Corinth, they were looking and glorying in their flesh, and he says, let me share

460
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:21,079
with you some of my experience, and we find that as you would couple this passage with

461
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,239
that in the book of Philippians, that he says, I count all these things but dung.

462
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:31,519
He desires to win Christ and to know Christ, and so he's kind of being very fastidious

463
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,359
here, if you will, with them.

464
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,359
Notice he says in verse 22, are they Hebrews?

465
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,359
So am I.

466
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,359
Are they Israelites?

467
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,359
So am I.

468
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,359
Are they the seed of Abraham?

469
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,359
So am I.

470
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,519
Are they ministers of Christ?

471
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,519
I speak as a fool.

472
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,519
I am more.

473
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,159
Then notice the list that he begins in verse 23.

474
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,679
In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths

475
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,439
oft.

476
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:59,759
Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes, save one.

477
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,359
Thrice was I beaten with rods.

478
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,479
Once was I stoned.

479
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,479
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

480
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,119
A night and a day I've been in the deep.

481
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,999
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own

482
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:18,399
instrument, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,

483
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,199
in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren.

484
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:27,679
Verse 27, he says, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,

485
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,079
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

486
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,079
Paul, why would you endure such things?

487
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,399
Paul, don't you know that if you just stopped going to these cities and preaching that you

488
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,759
wouldn't endure such hardship?

489
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,439
I believe that if we could bring Paul to the platform this morning, that he would answer

490
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:56,519
the question and say, because my Savior lives, I will endure hardship.

491
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,559
The songwriter said, it will be worth it all.

492
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,559
When?

493
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,119
When we see Christ.

494
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,119
We see Him face-to-face.

495
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,999
Listen, all of life's troubles, all of life's problems, all of the things that we endure,

496
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:13,759
it will be worth it all, and we find that Paul, as he's speaking to these believers

497
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:19,599
in Corinth, as he just proves to them without any shadow of a doubt that we serve a risen

498
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,599
Savior, that he lives, he says, I will preach the gospel.

499
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,399
His life says that.

500
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,379
His action, his behavior demonstrates this thing, I will preach the gospel, why?

501
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,879
Because I serve a risen Savior.

502
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,219
I will endure hardship, why?

503
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,919
Because I serve a risen Savior.

504
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:40,839
And it's worth it.

505
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,719
It's worth every moment.

506
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:44,719
I'm just like you.

507
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:46,319
I don't like enduring hardship.

508
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,839
I really don't.

509
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,879
I don't like to be inconvenienced.

510
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,759
Do you?

511
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,439
I don't know many of us that enjoy it.

512
00:27:56,439 --> 00:28:02,079
But I think of what Paul said in the book of Philippians in the first chapter.

513
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,759
He said that the things that happened unto him happened for the furtherance of the gospel.

514
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,679
You know, there are times in which we can endure hardship, and those are open doors

515
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:15,419
of being able to preach the gospel.

516
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,639
The two really go together.

517
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:22,039
You know, there are many that Paul had the opportunity to preach the gospel to while

518
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,239
he was imprisoned.

519
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:31,539
People that came into his presence that were exposed to the truth of the gospel, why?

520
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,039
Because he endured hardship.

521
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,839
Do you remember when he was in Philippi?

522
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:47,159
And he was beaten, and he was imprisoned, and Paul and Silas are there in prison.

523
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,399
What are they doing at midnight?

524
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,059
They're singing.

525
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,559
They're praising God.

526
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,359
There's a great earthquake.

527
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,959
The prison doors are opened, and that Philippian jailer is ready to take his life.

528
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:04,879
Why was he ready to take his life?

529
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:11,199
Because as a person in charge, if those that are incarcerated are freed, then your life

530
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,199
is in jeopardy.

531
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:16,039
And so he was ready to take his own life.

532
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,519
And Paul said, no, no, no, we're all here.

533
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:27,879
Sirs, what must I do to be saved, right?

534
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:30,559
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

535
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
Paul's ready to preach the gospel.

536
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,359
You think about the church in Philippi.

537
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,839
As that book of Philippians is being written back to that church, I believe one of the

538
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,559
founding members is the Philippian jailer.

539
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,959
And it's because of enduring hardship that that man was exposed to the gospel.

540
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,879
See this morning, we serve a risen Savior.

541
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:55,879
He knows.

542
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,239
And there are times in our lives when hardship may enter, but I will...

543
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:06,999
endure that hardship. Why? Because He lives. Because He lives. Number one, because He lives,

544
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:12,159
I will preach the gospel. Number two, because He lives, I will endure hardship. Number three,

545
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:21,279
because He lives, I will live for Him. Because He lives, I will live for Him.

546
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,399
You know, this morning, there are a lot of people that want to live for themselves. How

547
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,719
many times we hear someone say, this is my life. Can I tell you this morning, as a child

548
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:43,999
of God, He bought you. Paul says to the same group of people in Corinth, he said, what?

549
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:49,839
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which you have of God? He

550
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,839
says this, He's like, you're not your own, you're bought with a price. Notice back in

551
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:02,399
1 Corinthians 15, notice what Paul says about this truth of because He lives, I will live

552
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:10,239
for Him. I believe that as we look at verses 33 and 34, notice what Paul says, be not deceived.

553
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:16,959
Evil communications corrupt good manners. I think every mother, whether they knew they

554
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:23,999
were quoting Bible or not, has used this verse of Scripture. They use the analogy of the

555
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:29,159
good apple and the bad apple, and so on and so forth. Evil communications corrupt good

556
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,719
manners. It's a biblical truth. And here, these believers in Corinth, they were being

557
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:41,079
influenced by the culture. Notice what he says, awake to righteousness and sin not,

558
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,839
for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. Notice in verse

559
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,239
34, awake to righteousness and sin not. When I think about the truth that my Savior lives,

560
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:56,879
I desire to live for Him. I desire that my life would count for Jesus. I desire that

561
00:31:56,879 --> 00:32:04,479
I would live my life not to please myself, but to please my Savior. And this morning,

562
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:08,959
as we think about that truth, I want you to think about this truth in Philippians 1. Turn

563
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:13,199
over, if you will, to Philippians chapter number 1, and notice what the Word of God

564
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:20,239
says here in Philippians chapter number 1. I've mentioned already from verse number 12

565
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,599
how that Paul was speaking about the truth, that the things that had happened to him happened

566
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:33,599
for the furtherance of the gospel. And here now, as we look at this truth of living for

567
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,039
the Lord Jesus Christ, Paul is going to continue writing to these believers. He says in verse

568
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,559
number 12, I'll begin there, but I would, you should understand, brethren, that the

569
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,679
things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,

570
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,999
so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places. Many

571
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:01,299
of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the

572
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:07,719
Word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and strife, and some also of

573
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:14,319
goodwill. The one preached Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction

574
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,319
to my bonds, but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.

575
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:26,279
What then? Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached,

576
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:33,279
and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation

577
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,559
through your prayer, the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation

578
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,639
and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so

579
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:51,639
now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. And then

580
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:58,799
notice what he says in verse 21, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. For

581
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:06,799
to me to live is Christ. As a child of God, that ought to be our perspective. God's given

582
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:15,039
us this life, but He saved our souls. We dealt with salvation in our first point this morning,

583
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,639
and if you've been saved this morning, you've been bought with that price, the precious

584
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,639
blood of Jesus Christ, and now I desire to live for Him. For to me to live is Christ.

585
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:30,319
It's very interesting, because in this same book, in Philippians 1, you see in verse 21,

586
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:35,919
where Paul is saying, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But then notice

587
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,079
what the Bible says in chapter 2 and verse number 21. Paul is speaking here about sending

588
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,399
Timothy in this particular section of the book of Philippians. In fact, he says in verse

589
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,319
19, I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you. And so Paul was desiring,

590
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:54,399
he's in prison, so he can't go there, so he's going to send Timothy in his stead, and he's

591
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,639
going to have Timothy go. But notice what he says with regard to those that were not

592
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,039
like-minded. He says in verse 20, I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for

593
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:11,039
your state other than Timothy. But notice this in verse 21, for all seek their own,

594
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:15,839
not the things which are Jesus Christ. Isn't there a great contrast between Philippians

595
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,839
121 and Philippians 221? Paul says, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

596
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:30,159
But then he says of others, he says, they all seek their own, not the things which are

597
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:37,159
Jesus Christ. This morning, whatever role you find yourself in, whatever position you

598
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:43,119
are in in life, you must, if you have been born again, if you are saved, you must understand

599
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,119
that first and foremost, your identity is in Jesus Christ. I am a Christian first. Amen?

600
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,399
And after being a Christian, then maybe I will state the citizenship of the country

601
00:35:55,399 --> 00:36:00,079
in which I belong to. I would say, I'm an American. And then maybe the profession in

602
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,439
which we hold. I am a pastor. I am in law enforcement. I'm in the military. I work for

603
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:09,799
the fill-in-the-blank. I'm a lawyer. I'm a doctor, whatever it is. But listen, our first

604
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:16,799
identity as a child of God must be, I'm a Christian. Then, I'm a fill-in-the-blank,

605
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:24,679
fill-in-the-blank. But when my identity is in Jesus Christ, it is for me to live is Christ.

606
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:31,999
And so when I'm in my workplace, when I'm fulfilling my role as being a doctor, a lawyer,

607
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:38,999
a banker, in the IT world, wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, in that position, I'm

608
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:46,959
living for Christ because for me to live is Christ. He says, and to die is gain.

609
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:54,759
I want you to think about this for a moment. What is Paul referring to? Well, see, Paul

610
00:36:54,759 --> 00:37:00,999
understood that he had been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. And Paul understood that

611
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:08,039
he had been adopted into the family of God, that God was his Father and he was his child.

612
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:13,039
Paul understood, as he says to those believers in Corinth, to be absent from the body is

613
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:19,599
to be present with the Lord. So when Paul speaks about dying here, he says, listen,

614
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,599
and to die is gain. Why? Because I'm going to go be with my Savior. For me to live is

615
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:34,639
Christ and to die is gain. Notice how Paul mentions the situation in verse 22. He says,

616
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,759
in Philippians 1, he says, but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor,

617
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,559
yet what I shall choose I will not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, verse 23, having

618
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:53,559
a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better. You know, one day we

619
00:37:54,399 --> 00:38:01,399
will see Him face to face. And until that day, I want to live for Him.

620
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:09,399
I would submit this to you this morning. Yes, as a child of God, to die is gain. But I would

621
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,219
say this, to live for Him is gain. To live for Him is gain. For to me to live is Christ,

622
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:22,979
that is a gain. Amen? Why? Because we can hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

623
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:27,579
We can live a life that is pleasing in His sight. We don't have to be in a position where

624
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:34,579
we are ashamed at His appearing. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

625
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,499
We often speak about and understand in the context of Philippians 1 that he's speaking

626
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:44,059
about dying and going to be with the Lord. It's obvious through verse number 23 that

627
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:50,059
that's the context in which he's dealing with. But we read in 1 Corinthians 15 where he says,

628
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:55,579
I die daily. We read in Galatians 2 and verse number 20 where Paul says, I am crucified

629
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,539
with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. In the life which

630
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:06,419
I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and died for

631
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:13,419
me. And you think about this truth. Listen, when I die to self, that's a gain. It's a

632
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:21,299
gain. We find here, because He lives, I will live for Him. I'm going to finish up here

633
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:29,099
in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 in verse number 15. If you received an email from me, a card

634
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:37,339
from me, I often sign my name with this verse of Scripture. Occasionally I'll be at a pastor's

635
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:43,339
meeting somewhere, a conference somewhere, and there'll be some young people that will

636
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:50,339
come and say, Pastor, would you sign my Bible for me? It's a humbling thing to do that,

637
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:54,899
but anytime I ever sign someone's Bible, I sign it as Pastor Chris Mann, Jr., and then

638
00:39:54,899 --> 00:40:01,899
I put this verse of Scripture. 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 15, and that He died for

639
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:11,819
died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto

640
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:15,219
Him which died for them and rose again."

641
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,739
You see the resurrection?

642
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:18,859
And rose again.

643
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:25,219
So because He lives, I will live for Him because He's coming again.

644
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:31,739
Listen, if there's no resurrection, there's no return.

645
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:36,019
We read of the resurrection, we read of the ascension, and then we read of the promise

646
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,779
of His return.

647
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:46,219
And one day, one glorious day, we're going to be with Him.

648
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:51,379
Whether by death or by rapture, we're going to be with Him.

649
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:54,219
And this morning, we serve a risen Savior.

650
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,379
We know that He lives.

651
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:02,899
And I just wonder this morning, how has the truth, the power of the resurrection impacted

652
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:04,859
me personally?

653
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,619
Because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

654
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,499
Am I?

655
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:12,699
Will I?

656
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:17,299
Because He lives, I will endure hardship.

657
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:24,859
Paul tells Timothy in 2 Timothy 2 to endure hardness as a good soldier.

658
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:27,979
You know what he says to him just a few verses after that?

659
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:31,939
Remember that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.

660
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:34,299
Wow.

661
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,059
I will endure hardship, why?

662
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,219
Because my Savior lives.

663
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:42,699
And I will live for Him because He lives.

664
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:48,259
We live in a generation, we live in a society, it's all about me.

665
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,259
What makes me happy?

666
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,219
What do I want to do?

667
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,219
What do you want to do?

668
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:57,579
But we ought to start asking the question of, what does God want me to do?

669
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:58,579
Because I want to live for Him.

670
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:03,499
I want to live a life that's pleasing in His sight, proving what is acceptable in the sight

671
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:04,499
of the Lord.

672
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:07,939
And because He lives, I will live for Him.

673
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,099
He's coming again.

674
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:16,019
I don't know the hour or the day, but I know that He lives and one day I will see Him.

675
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,019
Let's pray together.

676
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,559
Father, we love You.

677
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,579
We thank You for loving us.

678
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,459
We thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together this morning.

679
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:29,859
We thank You for the truth of Your Word, the power of Your Word.

680
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:35,719
We're so thankful for the resurrection because we're mindful this morning of this wonderful

681
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,139
Bible truth.

682
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:43,919
We've asked ourselves the question of, how has this truth impacted me?

683
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:51,519
How has my behavior been altered because I serve a risen Savior?

684
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:59,119
We see these three aspects of the life of the Apostle Paul as we've examined these passages

685
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,119
of Scripture this morning.

686
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,159
I pray that You'd help us to be honest with You and honest with ourselves.

687
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,759
Are we preaching the gospel?

688
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:12,919
Are we enduring hardness?

689
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:15,999
Are we living for Christ?

690
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:21,519
I pray that in this time of invitation that we'd do business with You, that we'd allow

691
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,919
You, Lord, to have Your will and way in our hearts and lives.

692
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:28,879
And if we're not preaching the gospel, if we're not enduring hardness, if we're not

693
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:33,239
living for You, would You help us to get that settled this morning?

694
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,159
Help us, Lord, to make those commitments to You this morning and that as we leave this

695
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:45,919
place we'd be changed because of how we've been impacted by the resurrection of our Savior.

696
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:51,159
Perhaps there's one in our presence this morning that's not sure of heaven.

697
00:43:51,159 --> 00:44:00,599
In fact, if you were to be asked this question, if you were to die today, are you 100 percent

698
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,119
sure that you'd go to heaven?

699
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,679
Perhaps this morning you cannot answer that question with confidence and with assurance

700
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,119
that heaven is your home.

701
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,759
There's never been a time in your life when you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your

702
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:17,959
personal Savior.

703
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:22,399
Could I tell you today that the gospel is for you?

704
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:29,759
Can I tell you today that the Word of God says, behold, today is the day of salvation?

705
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:33,599
We'd like to invite you to come and we'd take a Bible and show you how you could know for

706
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,799
sure that heaven is your home, could leave this place knowing with certainty and with

707
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:45,959
confidence that if you were to die, or when you die, that heaven is your home.

708
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:51,359
Oh, God, I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only You can.

709
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,639
We pray that in these few moments that You'd be exalted and magnified, for it's in Christ's

710
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,639
name we pray.

711
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:59,359
Would You stand with me?

712
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,719
For those visiting with us at the end of each of our services, we have an invitation

713
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:03,719
time.

714
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,119
That's where we give you an opportunity.

715
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,399
No one's looking around, heads are bowed, eyes are closed, and the piano will play here

716
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:11,159
in just a moment.

717
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,399
And as the piano plays, the altar will be open and we'd invite you to come and maybe

718
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:19,679
you need to make some type of commitment to the Lord, ask Him to help you to live for

719
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,119
Him, ask Him to help you to preach the gospel as you ought, to endure hardship.

720
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,559
But maybe this morning you're not sure of heaven.

721
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,199
Oh, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your

722
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,239
home.

723
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:36,079
We would not want you to leave this place without knowing with confidence, with assurance

724
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,799
that heaven is your home.

725
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:41,319
Jared will play quietly on the piano, and as he does, the altar is open.
