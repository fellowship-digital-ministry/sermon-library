00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
and Juliana's home from college, amen.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.019
And so thankful to have her home.

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:06.739
She'll be leaving on Tuesday to head back.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.899
And so if you'd pray for her over the next few weeks

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.260
as she finishes up, I know that she'd appreciate that.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.220
First Corinthians chapter 15.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.100
And this sounds a little weird to me.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.020
Does it sound weird to you?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.940
It does sound weird to you.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.379
It sounds weird to me up here.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.659
So Jim, if you could try to help with that a little bit,

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.860
it just sounds a little echoey to me up here.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.780
And some of the folks that it feels a little weird

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.500
to them as well, that sounds a whole lot better, amen.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.200
And First Corinthians 15.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.319
And I am so thankful for the truth

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:34.880
that we serve a risen savior.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360
We've mentioned it many times already this morning

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.540
and it is worth repeating.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.400
And he lives, he lives, amen.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.000
And one day, one glorious day, he is coming back.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.599
And I don't know the hour nor the day, and neither do you,

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:52.380
but the reality is that we're to listen for the trumpet.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.220
Why?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.759
Because Jesus is coming.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.700
And I am so thankful for that precious truth.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.919
Just as we read this morning in Matthew's gospel

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.520
when we had our morning outside service

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.720
at 7 a.m. this morning, there in Matthew's gospel,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.360
he is not here, for he is risen as he said.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.660
And the reality is that he is coming again.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.500
Why?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.319
Because he said he was.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.680
He said, let not your heart be troubled.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.279
In my father's house are many mansions.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.160
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.559
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.319
And he said this, if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.940
I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.099
that where I am, there you may be also.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.139
In John chapter 14 in verses one through three,

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:37.819
he then later said in that same passage,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.139
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:43.139
No man cometh unto the father but by me.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.500
I am so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ paid the price

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.779
for my sin and for your sin and for the sin of the world.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.019
Amen?

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.620
And it is a tremendous blessing to know the truth

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
of God's word, to know the truth of redemption,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.160
the plan of redemption that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800
would come, that price would be his substitution

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.039
or atonement on the cross of Calvary.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.520
Of course, he was buried and he rose,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
And what a blessing.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.279
I believe that each of us, many of us here this morning

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.639
would agree that the resurrection of Jesus Christ

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.899
is indeed the cornerstone of our faith.

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.520
In fact, in this passage of scripture

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.100
in 1 Corinthians 15, there were some that were saying

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.399
that there is no resurrection.

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.960
And Paul said if there's no resurrection,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
then that means Christ is not risen.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.119
And if Christ is not risen, then your preaching is vain,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.960
that our faith is vain.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.759
But he announces and he proves with great just purpose

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.759
and great power that Christ indeed is risen from the dead.

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.820
Our faith is not in vain.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.880
Our preaching is not in vain.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.720
Why?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.800
Because we serve a risen savior.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.320
And we meet on the first day of the week

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.660
because Jesus Christ rose,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.539
conquering sin, death, and the grave

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.039
on the first day of the week.

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.860
We find that this passage of scripture

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740
that is before us this morning really

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.220
is the classic, if you will, passage of scripture

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.800
that deals with the resurrection of our savior,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.720
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.740
As we've mentioned many times over the years,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.699
there's false teachers that are recorded

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.679
in the word of God.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.940
And we continue today to deal with false teaching.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.800
It is a prevalent thing that will be

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.279
throughout the church age.

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.880
And we think about the false teaching,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.880
and there was false teaching prevalent there in Corinth.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.639
And some of these believers that had been given the truth

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.240
as the apostle Paul and his missionary journey

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.860
went and saw this church started,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.199
there were some false teachers that came in.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.699
And some of these false teachers were teaching

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.360
that Jesus had not risen from the dead.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.199
And they had been influenced by these false teachers.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.580
And so the Lord, through the apostle Paul,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.580
he used Paul to encourage and to instruct

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.300
the believers at Corinth with regard to the resurrection.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.300
It's interesting in Acts 1 in verse number three,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.199
the Bible begins in that passage of scripture

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.820
by speaking of the resurrection.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.779
And it says that he, speaking of Christ,

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.699
showed himself alive after his passion

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:19.700
by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.040
and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.140
We find that even in this passage of scripture

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.399
in 1 Corinthians 15, that Paul also speaks

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.880
of the evidence of Christ's resurrection,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.880
and he declares it to be so with great authority.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.839
I believe this morning that as we consider

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.839
the truth of the resurrection,

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.160
that we ought to consider the impact

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.320
that this truth has on the life of every believer.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320
Because God has given us the truth of his word,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.859
because he has revealed his nature, his character,

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.260
his attributes to us, it should impact us.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.899
It should impact our behavior.

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:58.619
I've said many times over the years

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.700
that belief impacts behavior.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.059
We sang as we were outside this morning,

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.660
one of the songs that we sang was Because He Lives.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.700
And the songwriter said,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.500
"'Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.'"

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.140
The songwriter said, "'Because he lives, all fear is gone,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.119
"'because I know, I know that he holds the future

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.079
"'and life is worth the living.'"

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.920
Why?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.559
"'Just because he lives.'"

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.619
And so this morning, I wanna preach a message to you

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:27.859
that's actually the same title as that song,

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:29.459
Because He Lives.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.220
And when we think about the truth of the resurrection,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.640
we would understand this morning

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.739
that it should have a great impact upon the people of God.

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:42.200
How has the reality of his resurrection impacted you?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.399
That's the question as we go through

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.040
the portion of scripture this morning.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.239
Notice in verse number one,

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:51.000
the apostle Paul begins by saying this,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.540
"'Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.179
"'which I preached unto you, which also you have received,

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:03.320
"'and wherein ye stand, by which also you are saved,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.380
"'if you keep in memory what I preached unto you,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.359
"'unless you have believed in vain.

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:08.980
"'For I delivered unto you, first of all,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.059
"'that which I also received,

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.760
"'how that Christ died for our sins,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760
"'according to the scriptures,

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:18.160
"'and that He was buried, and that He rose again

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.459
"'the third day, according to the scriptures,

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.500
"'and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.559
"'After that, He was seen of above 500 brethren at once,

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:31.359
"'of whom the greater part remain under this present,

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.899
"'but some are fallen asleep.

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.380
"'After that, He was seen of James,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.640
"'then of all the apostles.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.079
"'And last of all, He was seen of me also,

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.579
"'as of one born out of due time.'"

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.640
As we look at this passage of scripture this morning,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.640
we're reminded that Paul was speaking

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.880
about the certainty, the reality of Christ's resurrection.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.619
And notice in verses five through eight

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:57.820
how that he speaks of the reality of His resurrection.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.880
He says that He was seen of Cephas, and then of the twelve.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.619
And then he says this in verse number six,

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:07.619
that He was seen of above 500 brethren at once.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.760
And he says of that group of people that many of them,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.059
of whom the greater part remain under this present.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.459
In other words, they were still alive.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.720
They had not yet died.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.220
He does say at the end of the verse

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.019
that some are fallen asleep, some have died.

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:23.459
But many of that group, that 500,

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:26.519
they still were alive at the time of the writing

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.859
of 1 Corinthians chapter number 15.

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:30.459
We find that you continue,

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.839
and he speaks about James and the apostles.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:36.339
But then Paul says this of himself in verse number eight.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.380
And last of all, He was seen of me also

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.279
as of one born out of due time.

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:45.799
And I can understand that Paul is writing no doubt

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.739
about that experience as it's recorded in Acts nine.

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.420
And understanding that he too had the privilege

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.239
of seeing the resurrected Christ.

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:56.220
We begin to think about the resurrection

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.420
and begin to understand the impact

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.679
that it should have on our lives.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.619
I would say this, number one, if you're taking notes,

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:05.619
because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:09.200
Because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.200
Notice in the first few verses of our text of scripture,

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:14.920
the apostle Paul makes no bones about it.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.640
He says to these believers,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.679
he says, I declared unto you the gospel.

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.359
He speaks about the way in which he came to them

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.799
and he preached unto them,

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:26.380
and he preached to them the gospel.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.179
What is the gospel?

00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:30.359
The reality is that if there's no resurrection,

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:31.700
there's no gospel.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.080
Because the reality is that the gospel in its entirety

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.760
is not simply the death of Jesus Christ

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.080
on the cross of Calvary,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.039
nor is it just simply His death and His burial,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.520
but it is the death, burial, and resurrection

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.760
of Jesus Christ that is the gospel.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.440
It is the good news of Jesus Christ.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.799
And we understand this morning,

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.119
as we think about the gospel,

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:55.200
that Paul, as he's speaking here,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.320
he says to them in verse number three,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.419
for I delivered unto you, first of all,

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:00.919
that which I also received.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:04.200
Understand that Paul says, this is not my gospel.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.940
If you were to read the book of Galatians

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.239
in the first chapter, you would find that Paul

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:10.640
makes it very clear that he is preaching

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.479
that which the Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:15.000
had delivered to him and given him.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.119
In fact, he says this in Galatians one,

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.919
in verse number 11 and 12,

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.719
but I certify you, brethren,

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:23.900
that the gospel which was preached of me

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.840
is not after man, for I neither received it of man,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.440
neither was I taught it,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.799
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:35.799
And so Paul, as he's speaking here in 1 Corinthians 15

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.880
to these believers that had been influenced

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.840
by these false teachers, he says,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.380
I want to remind you that I came in

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.440
and I preached to you.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.320
I delivered unto you, first of all,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320
that which I also received,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.640
how that Christ died for our sins,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.320
according to the scriptures.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.479
Let me say a few things about verse number three.

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:59.080
It's not just sufficient to say that Jesus died.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.159
There was a reason.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:06.799
And that reason is given to us in this verse of Scripture throughout the whole of God's

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:07.799
Word.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:12.919
We find that the reason that Christ died is for our sins.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:17.599
The Bible says how that Christ died for our sins.

00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:19.919
Just grasp that just for a moment this morning.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:23.739
A couple of weeks ago, we had a missionary last week, but two weeks ago I preached a

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:30.019
message on the sufferings of Jesus Christ and how that Peter said that he was a witness

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.959
of the sufferings of Christ.

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:35.719
And we understand this morning that he died for our sins.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:42.279
You know that sin is a universal condition of mankind?

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:46.279
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.839
There's not a just man upon the face of the earth.

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:54.239
The only one to ever walk the face of this earth without sin is Jesus Christ himself,

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:56.059
God in flesh.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:58.519
And so sin is a universal condition.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:03.519
Every single one of us, we sang that song this morning about the, it's under the blood.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:09.199
And the reality is that I'm so thankful this morning that I can say that yes, I'm a sinner,

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:11.959
but I'm a forgiven sinner.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:12.959
It's under the blood.

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:16.359
I've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:20.999
But we understand this morning that Jesus, he died specifically for your sin and for

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:23.819
my sin and for the sin of the world.

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:25.559
Why did he do that?

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:29.679
Because it was the only way that man could be reconciled to God.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.999
Because man had sinned.

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:35.799
We find that the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter number three, how that sin entered

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.799
into the world.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:42.799
And you understand the truth of Romans chapter number five, the Bible speaks about that as

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:46.759
sin entered in the world, that death also is the result.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:53.879
And we understand that not simply physical death, but spiritual death.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:58.359
Jesus is appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment.

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:02.299
And because of our sin, we need a savior.

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:04.919
Because of our sin, we need payment to be made.

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:09.219
And let me say this this morning, you can never pay for your sin.

00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:11.619
And I could never pay for my sin.

00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:15.659
The debt is a debt that we cannot pay.

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:21.239
The only payment that was accepted by God Almighty for the sin of mankind is the precious

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.319
blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:27.839
We are not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold received by tradition

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:28.839
from our fathers.

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:29.839
No, no.

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:30.919
We're not redeemed with those things.

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:37.759
We are redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without spot or blemish.

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:41.119
And we are rejoicing this morning that He died.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:42.479
Why did He die?

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:44.619
For our sins.

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:47.999
And notice it says, according to the Scriptures.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:53.279
I'm thankful for the Old Testament prophecies that prophesy not only of the coming of the

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:57.759
Lord Jesus Christ, but I'm thankful for the Old Testament prophecies that prophesy of

00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:01.879
His sufferings on the cross of Calvary, that He would go to the cross and He would pay

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:04.959
that price for mankind.

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:09.459
Many today do not know the truth of the gospel.

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:14.319
They are going about trying to, maybe they've acknowledged their own sin problem, but maybe

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:17.439
they're trying to pay for their sin through some other means.

00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:22.439
Maybe they think that if I could be a good enough person, if I could do enough good things,

00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:24.799
then God will accept me.

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:31.359
Can I tell you on the authority of the Word of God, it's just not accepted payment.

00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:37.919
All of our good works, the verse that Holly sang in that song, are as filthy rags, according

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:40.679
to what Isaiah tells us.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:45.399
There's no way that you could ever pay for your sin, because the only payment that's

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:48.119
accepted is the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:53.839
And He died for our sins, and He died according to the Scriptures.

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:56.719
Notice in verse number 4, and that He was buried.

00:13:56.719 --> 00:14:01.119
We can read the account, we see the record of the burial of the Lord Jesus Christ in

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:02.119
each of the gospels.

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:05.679
He was buried, I often say, in that borrowed tomb.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.359
And He was buried in that borrowed tomb.

00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:14.679
You remember Joseph of Arimathea, he comes to Pilate begging the body, and he and Nicodemus,

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:18.559
they go and they put Jesus in the tomb.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:23.839
But then you notice in verse number 4, it says, and that He rose again the third day

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.599
according to the Scriptures.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:31.199
I'm so thankful that He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:34.839
You see the phrase, according to the Scriptures, again, as you study the Old Testament, as

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:41.639
you study the prophecies concerning the substitutionary atonement, but also the glorious resurrection

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:43.739
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:49.419
And so because He lives, I will preach the gospel, because I know it's the gospel that

00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:52.779
is the power of God to save sinners.

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:55.739
I know it was the gospel that changed my life.

00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:56.739
Think about this.

00:14:56.739 --> 00:14:58.699
Turn back, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 9.

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:04.019
Notice what the Apostle Paul says here, his testimony, as he's sharing with these believers

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:05.019
here in Corinth.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:10.819
Notice what he says in 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 16.

00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:15.179
In 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 16, he says, for though I preach the gospel, I have

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:23.019
nothing to glory of, for necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:24.019
the gospel.

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:30.339
If you look over at verse number 23, notice what he says, and this I do for the gospel's

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:31.339
sake.

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:34.059
You see, Paul understood something about the gospel.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:39.659
In Romans chapter number 1, the Word of God gives us some truth with regard to really

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:44.979
the perspective that Paul had with regard to preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:51.019
And as he is giving this introductory statement to the believers there in Rome, in Romans

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:56.659
1, in verse number 1, he says, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,

00:15:56.659 --> 00:16:03.099
notice what it says, separated unto the gospel of God, which He promised to for by His prophets

00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:07.339
and the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, which was made of

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:13.099
the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:18.099
according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.

00:16:18.099 --> 00:16:27.099
And then notice in verse number 15, he says, so, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach

00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:30.019
the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:33.419
What made Paul prepared and ready to preach the gospel?

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:36.419
It was that he understood that Christ lives.

00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:41.099
And he says, because He lives, I'm going to preach the gospel.

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:45.499
You know, the reality is that we live in a world that's been blinded by the God of this

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.339
world, the little g God of this world, Satan.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:52.139
He has blinded the minds of them that believe not.

00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:57.699
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, God speaks about that very truth, about how the minds

00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:01.459
of them that believe not, their minds have been blinded.

00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:06.499
But notice that Paul says this in the same passage of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 4, in

00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:15.899
verse number 3, he says, but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:21.939
He then says this in verse number 7, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:26.459
excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:29.759
You know the treasure that we have in earthen vessels?

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:35.339
It's the gospel, the Holy Spirit of God that lives within us, but the light of the glorious

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:38.359
gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:42.599
And he says, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:45.839
Who lights a candlestick and puts it under a bushel?

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.239
We sing with the kids, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, right?

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:52.239
And we tell them, don't let Satan blow it out.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.719
We tell them, hide it under a bushel, no.

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:58.999
I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:00.719
And I preach the gospel, why?

00:18:00.719 --> 00:18:01.719
Because he lives.

00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:07.199
Listen, if Christ had not risen from the dead, as he says in this passage of Scripture in

00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:15.919
1 Corinthians 15, there's no reason for us to preach if Christ be not risen.

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:23.079
But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:25.399
according to 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 20.

00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:28.799
And so because he lives, I will preach the gospel.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:33.639
Let me say this, number two, if you're taking notes this morning, because he lives, I will

00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:36.000
endure hardship.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I will endure hardship.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.440
You say, I like that first point.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.799
Listen, this morning as we look at Paul's testimony and he's preaching to these people

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:50.879
in Corinth and he's speaking to them about the power of the resurrection and the truth

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:56.159
of the resurrection, I want you to look and skip ahead to verse number 20.

00:18:56.159 --> 00:19:00.679
I've kind of referenced it twice, but he says, but now is Christ risen from the dead

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:03.879
and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:11.479
For since by man came death, by man also came also the resurrection of the dead.

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:16.119
As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:19.879
But every man in his own order, Christ the firstfruits, afterward they that are Christ

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:23.959
it is coming, then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God,

00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:30.159
and the Father, when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:33.319
For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:36.679
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:42.079
And so Paul is giving the truth of the resurrected Christ and he's telling them about the power

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.679
of the resurrection.

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:47.239
But think about the impact, again, upon the people of God.

00:19:47.239 --> 00:19:52.479
Notice in verse number 30, down through verse number 32, notice what Paul says, and why

00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:58.799
stand we in jeopardy every hour?

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.199
He says this, I protest by...

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:06.439
rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:12.759
We see in verse number 30 that he's speaking about this standing in jeopardy every hour.

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.839
He says in verse 31, I die daily.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:20.319
Notice what he says in verse number 32, if after the manner of men I have fought with

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:28.639
beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the dead rise not?

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:32.839
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:38.819
Listen, if there's no resurrection, why am I going to endure hardship?

00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:43.039
But because he lives, I will endure hardship.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:47.759
I will understand that there's going to be times of difficulty.

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:53.079
The Bible says, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution,

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:54.919
and I will endure those hardships.

00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:55.919
Why?

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.279
Because I know he lives.

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:01.959
And because he lives, because he conquered sin, death, and the grave, I will endure

00:21:01.959 --> 00:21:02.959
that hardship.

00:21:02.959 --> 00:21:08.199
Paul mentions specifically in verse number 32 the experience that he had at Ephesus.

00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:12.439
We will not take the time to turn over to Acts 19 and see the record of that, but the

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:19.159
reality is that Paul is saying, what advantage do I have for enduring this hardship if the

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:21.719
dead rise not?

00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:27.719
But the reason that I would endure this hardship is because I know that he lives, and I know

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.559
that I, too, will live.

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:31.519
I will be resurrected.

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:37.119
And because of that powerful truth, the impact of that truth on Paul and on every child of

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:40.979
God ought to be that we, too, would endure hardship.

00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:46.599
This experience that he mentions there in Ephesus, he then follows it up with a statement

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:49.359
after he speaks about what advantage would there be.

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:54.319
He said, listen, if the dead rise not, then let us just follow this same thought.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:58.619
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:05.199
If this world is all there really is, that's the motto to follow.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.679
This world is not all that there is.

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:08.979
This is just temporary.

00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:11.719
There's all of eternity.

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:16.159
To think about this morning the truth of what Paul is saying, it's very interesting because

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:23.999
it's very like to what Jesus said in Luke chapter number 12, in verse number 16-21,

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:28.759
the Lord Jesus Christ here in this passage of Scripture, there's a parable that is speaking,

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:33.959
and he talks about that certain rich man that brought forth plentifully.

00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:35.199
Remember that text of Scripture?

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:39.199
And in Luke chapter number 12, he speaks of that, and he says this, he says of that one,

00:22:39.199 --> 00:22:42.479
he says that he thought within himself, saying, what shall I do?

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:45.319
Because I have no room where to bestow my fruits.

00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:49.119
He said, this will I do, I will pull down my barns and build a draider, and there will

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:56.119
I bestow all my fruits and all my goods, and I will say to my soul, soul, thou hast much

00:22:56.119 --> 00:23:04.479
goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:15.439
But God said, but God said unto him, thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required

00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:21.679
of thee, then who shall those things be which thou hast provided?

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:26.599
You think about this as we understand the truth of the resurrection as we celebrate

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:32.799
this morning the resurrected Christ and understand that He lives, I would say because He lives

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.599
I will endure hardship.

00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:37.759
It's not an eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:42.679
That's not the philosophy of life, that's the philosophy of the world, that's not God's

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:47.359
philosophy from His book, and we study the Word of God and we understand, listen, I'm

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:52.839
going to endure hardship, I'm going to understand as Paul says that he was standing in jeopardy

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:53.839
every hour.

00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:58.039
In fact, let me share with you what he says, turn to the book of 2 Corinthians if you will,

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:06.879
in chapter number 11, notice the list that Paul provides of the things that he endured.

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:11.479
Oftentimes as we think about the Apostle Paul, we study through the book of Acts and study

00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:15.539
the epistles and we see a man that was fully surrendered to the Lord.

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:21.279
He was a man that was just sold out for Christ, so to speak, and he's living for the Lord,

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:24.159
but he's enduring hardship.

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:28.999
2 Corinthians 11, beginning in verse number 16, he says, I say again, let no man think

00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:34.999
me a fool, if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that I may boast myself a little.

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:39.999
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence

00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:42.239
of boasting.

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:45.559
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:49.519
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:53.959
But if ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take

00:24:53.999 --> 00:24:59.879
of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face, I speak as concerning reproach,

00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:01.879
as though we had been weak.

00:25:01.879 --> 00:25:06.719
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, I speak foolishly, I am bold also.

00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:11.239
So Paul is setting the scene in those first few verses to speak about how some of these

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:15.999
in Corinth, they were looking and glorying in their flesh, and he says, let me share

00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:21.079
with you some of my experience, and we find that as you would couple this passage with

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:25.239
that in the book of Philippians, that he says, I count all these things but dung.

00:25:25.239 --> 00:25:31.519
He desires to win Christ and to know Christ, and so he's kind of being very fastidious

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:33.359
here, if you will, with them.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.359
Notice he says in verse 22, are they Hebrews?

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.359
So am I.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:37.359
Are they Israelites?

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.359
So am I.

00:25:38.359 --> 00:25:39.359
Are they the seed of Abraham?

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:40.359
So am I.

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:41.519
Are they ministers of Christ?

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:42.519
I speak as a fool.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:43.519
I am more.

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.159
Then notice the list that he begins in verse 23.

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:52.679
In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths

00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:54.439
oft.

00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:59.759
Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes, save one.

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:02.359
Thrice was I beaten with rods.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:03.479
Once was I stoned.

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:04.479
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:08.119
A night and a day I've been in the deep.

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:13.999
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:18.399
instrument, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:22.199
in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren.

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:27.679
Verse 27, he says, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:32.079
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:36.079
Paul, why would you endure such things?

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:41.399
Paul, don't you know that if you just stopped going to these cities and preaching that you

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.759
wouldn't endure such hardship?

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:50.439
I believe that if we could bring Paul to the platform this morning, that he would answer

00:26:50.439 --> 00:26:56.519
the question and say, because my Savior lives, I will endure hardship.

00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.559
The songwriter said, it will be worth it all.

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:00.559
When?

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.119
When we see Christ.

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:03.119
We see Him face-to-face.

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:08.999
Listen, all of life's troubles, all of life's problems, all of the things that we endure,

00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:13.759
it will be worth it all, and we find that Paul, as he's speaking to these believers

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:19.599
in Corinth, as he just proves to them without any shadow of a doubt that we serve a risen

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:24.599
Savior, that he lives, he says, I will preach the gospel.

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:26.399
His life says that.

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:31.379
His action, his behavior demonstrates this thing, I will preach the gospel, why?

00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:33.879
Because I serve a risen Savior.

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:36.219
I will endure hardship, why?

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:38.919
Because I serve a risen Savior.

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:40.839
And it's worth it.

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:43.719
It's worth every moment.

00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:44.719
I'm just like you.

00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:46.319
I don't like enduring hardship.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:48.839
I really don't.

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:51.879
I don't like to be inconvenienced.

00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:53.759
Do you?

00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:56.439
I don't know many of us that enjoy it.

00:27:56.439 --> 00:28:02.079
But I think of what Paul said in the book of Philippians in the first chapter.

00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:07.759
He said that the things that happened unto him happened for the furtherance of the gospel.

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:12.679
You know, there are times in which we can endure hardship, and those are open doors

00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:15.419
of being able to preach the gospel.

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:17.639
The two really go together.

00:28:17.639 --> 00:28:22.039
You know, there are many that Paul had the opportunity to preach the gospel to while

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:25.239
he was imprisoned.

00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:31.539
People that came into his presence that were exposed to the truth of the gospel, why?

00:28:31.539 --> 00:28:33.039
Because he endured hardship.

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:37.839
Do you remember when he was in Philippi?

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:47.159
And he was beaten, and he was imprisoned, and Paul and Silas are there in prison.

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:49.399
What are they doing at midnight?

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:51.059
They're singing.

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:53.559
They're praising God.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:57.359
There's a great earthquake.

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:02.959
The prison doors are opened, and that Philippian jailer is ready to take his life.

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:04.879
Why was he ready to take his life?

00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:11.199
Because as a person in charge, if those that are incarcerated are freed, then your life

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:12.199
is in jeopardy.

00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:16.039
And so he was ready to take his own life.

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:19.519
And Paul said, no, no, no, we're all here.

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:27.879
Sirs, what must I do to be saved, right?

00:29:27.879 --> 00:29:30.559
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:33.039
Paul's ready to preach the gospel.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.359
You think about the church in Philippi.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:39.839
As that book of Philippians is being written back to that church, I believe one of the

00:29:39.839 --> 00:29:44.559
founding members is the Philippian jailer.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:50.959
And it's because of enduring hardship that that man was exposed to the gospel.

00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:54.879
See this morning, we serve a risen Savior.

00:29:54.879 --> 00:29:55.879
He knows.

00:29:55.879 --> 00:30:00.239
And there are times in our lives when hardship may enter, but I will...

00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:06.999
endure that hardship. Why? Because He lives. Because He lives. Number one, because He lives,

00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:12.159
I will preach the gospel. Number two, because He lives, I will endure hardship. Number three,

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:21.279
because He lives, I will live for Him. Because He lives, I will live for Him.

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:25.399
You know, this morning, there are a lot of people that want to live for themselves. How

00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:30.719
many times we hear someone say, this is my life. Can I tell you this morning, as a child

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:43.999
of God, He bought you. Paul says to the same group of people in Corinth, he said, what?

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:49.839
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which you have of God? He

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:55.839
says this, He's like, you're not your own, you're bought with a price. Notice back in

00:30:55.839 --> 00:31:02.399
1 Corinthians 15, notice what Paul says about this truth of because He lives, I will live

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:10.239
for Him. I believe that as we look at verses 33 and 34, notice what Paul says, be not deceived.

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:16.959
Evil communications corrupt good manners. I think every mother, whether they knew they

00:31:16.999 --> 00:31:23.999
were quoting Bible or not, has used this verse of Scripture. They use the analogy of the

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:29.159
good apple and the bad apple, and so on and so forth. Evil communications corrupt good

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:33.719
manners. It's a biblical truth. And here, these believers in Corinth, they were being

00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:41.079
influenced by the culture. Notice what he says, awake to righteousness and sin not,

00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:44.839
for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. Notice in verse

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:50.239
34, awake to righteousness and sin not. When I think about the truth that my Savior lives,

00:31:50.239 --> 00:31:56.879
I desire to live for Him. I desire that my life would count for Jesus. I desire that

00:31:56.879 --> 00:32:04.479
I would live my life not to please myself, but to please my Savior. And this morning,

00:32:04.479 --> 00:32:08.959
as we think about that truth, I want you to think about this truth in Philippians 1. Turn

00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:13.199
over, if you will, to Philippians chapter number 1, and notice what the Word of God

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:20.239
says here in Philippians chapter number 1. I've mentioned already from verse number 12

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:26.599
how that Paul was speaking about the truth, that the things that had happened to him happened

00:32:26.599 --> 00:32:33.599
for the furtherance of the gospel. And here now, as we look at this truth of living for

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:40.039
the Lord Jesus Christ, Paul is going to continue writing to these believers. He says in verse

00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:44.559
number 12, I'll begin there, but I would, you should understand, brethren, that the

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:50.679
things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:55.999
so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places. Many

00:32:55.999 --> 00:33:01.299
of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:07.719
Word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and strife, and some also of

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:14.319
goodwill. The one preached Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:20.319
to my bonds, but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.

00:33:20.319 --> 00:33:26.279
What then? Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached,

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:33.279
and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:39.559
through your prayer, the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:44.639
and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so

00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:51.639
now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. And then

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:58.799
notice what he says in verse 21, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. For

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:06.799
to me to live is Christ. As a child of God, that ought to be our perspective. God's given

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:15.039
us this life, but He saved our souls. We dealt with salvation in our first point this morning,

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:18.639
and if you've been saved this morning, you've been bought with that price, the precious

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:25.639
blood of Jesus Christ, and now I desire to live for Him. For to me to live is Christ.

00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:30.319
It's very interesting, because in this same book, in Philippians 1, you see in verse 21,

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:35.919
where Paul is saying, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But then notice

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:41.079
what the Bible says in chapter 2 and verse number 21. Paul is speaking here about sending

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:45.399
Timothy in this particular section of the book of Philippians. In fact, he says in verse

00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:50.319
19, I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you. And so Paul was desiring,

00:34:50.319 --> 00:34:54.399
he's in prison, so he can't go there, so he's going to send Timothy in his stead, and he's

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:59.639
going to have Timothy go. But notice what he says with regard to those that were not

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:04.039
like-minded. He says in verse 20, I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for

00:35:04.039 --> 00:35:11.039
your state other than Timothy. But notice this in verse 21, for all seek their own,

00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:15.839
not the things which are Jesus Christ. Isn't there a great contrast between Philippians

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:22.839
121 and Philippians 221? Paul says, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:30.159
But then he says of others, he says, they all seek their own, not the things which are

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:37.159
Jesus Christ. This morning, whatever role you find yourself in, whatever position you

00:35:37.799 --> 00:35:43.119
are in in life, you must, if you have been born again, if you are saved, you must understand

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:50.119
that first and foremost, your identity is in Jesus Christ. I am a Christian first. Amen?

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:55.399
And after being a Christian, then maybe I will state the citizenship of the country

00:35:55.399 --> 00:36:00.079
in which I belong to. I would say, I'm an American. And then maybe the profession in

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:04.439
which we hold. I am a pastor. I am in law enforcement. I'm in the military. I work for

00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:09.799
the fill-in-the-blank. I'm a lawyer. I'm a doctor, whatever it is. But listen, our first

00:36:09.799 --> 00:36:16.799
identity as a child of God must be, I'm a Christian. Then, I'm a fill-in-the-blank,

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:24.679
fill-in-the-blank. But when my identity is in Jesus Christ, it is for me to live is Christ.

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:31.999
And so when I'm in my workplace, when I'm fulfilling my role as being a doctor, a lawyer,

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:38.999
a banker, in the IT world, wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, in that position, I'm

00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:46.959
living for Christ because for me to live is Christ. He says, and to die is gain.

00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:54.759
I want you to think about this for a moment. What is Paul referring to? Well, see, Paul

00:36:54.759 --> 00:37:00.999
understood that he had been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. And Paul understood that

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:08.039
he had been adopted into the family of God, that God was his Father and he was his child.

00:37:08.439 --> 00:37:13.039
Paul understood, as he says to those believers in Corinth, to be absent from the body is

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:19.599
to be present with the Lord. So when Paul speaks about dying here, he says, listen,

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:26.599
and to die is gain. Why? Because I'm going to go be with my Savior. For me to live is

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:34.639
Christ and to die is gain. Notice how Paul mentions the situation in verse 22. He says,

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:41.759
in Philippians 1, he says, but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor,

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:46.559
yet what I shall choose I will not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, verse 23, having

00:37:46.559 --> 00:37:53.559
a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better. You know, one day we

00:37:54.399 --> 00:38:01.399
will see Him face to face. And until that day, I want to live for Him.

00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:09.399
I would submit this to you this morning. Yes, as a child of God, to die is gain. But I would

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:17.219
say this, to live for Him is gain. To live for Him is gain. For to me to live is Christ,

00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:22.979
that is a gain. Amen? Why? Because we can hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:27.579
We can live a life that is pleasing in His sight. We don't have to be in a position where

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:34.579
we are ashamed at His appearing. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:39.499
We often speak about and understand in the context of Philippians 1 that he's speaking

00:38:39.499 --> 00:38:44.059
about dying and going to be with the Lord. It's obvious through verse number 23 that

00:38:44.059 --> 00:38:50.059
that's the context in which he's dealing with. But we read in 1 Corinthians 15 where he says,

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:55.579
I die daily. We read in Galatians 2 and verse number 20 where Paul says, I am crucified

00:38:55.579 --> 00:39:00.539
with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. In the life which

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:06.419
I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and died for

00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:13.419
me. And you think about this truth. Listen, when I die to self, that's a gain. It's a

00:39:14.299 --> 00:39:21.299
gain. We find here, because He lives, I will live for Him. I'm going to finish up here

00:39:22.099 --> 00:39:29.099
in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 in verse number 15. If you received an email from me, a card

00:39:30.339 --> 00:39:37.339
from me, I often sign my name with this verse of Scripture. Occasionally I'll be at a pastor's

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:43.339
meeting somewhere, a conference somewhere, and there'll be some young people that will

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:50.339
come and say, Pastor, would you sign my Bible for me? It's a humbling thing to do that,

00:39:50.539 --> 00:39:54.899
but anytime I ever sign someone's Bible, I sign it as Pastor Chris Mann, Jr., and then

00:39:54.899 --> 00:40:01.899
I put this verse of Scripture. 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 15, and that He died for

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:11.819
died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:15.219
Him which died for them and rose again."

00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:17.739
You see the resurrection?

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:18.859
And rose again.

00:40:18.859 --> 00:40:25.219
So because He lives, I will live for Him because He's coming again.

00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:31.739
Listen, if there's no resurrection, there's no return.

00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:36.019
We read of the resurrection, we read of the ascension, and then we read of the promise

00:40:36.019 --> 00:40:37.779
of His return.

00:40:37.779 --> 00:40:46.219
And one day, one glorious day, we're going to be with Him.

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:51.379
Whether by death or by rapture, we're going to be with Him.

00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:54.219
And this morning, we serve a risen Savior.

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:57.379
We know that He lives.

00:40:57.379 --> 00:41:02.899
And I just wonder this morning, how has the truth, the power of the resurrection impacted

00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:04.859
me personally?

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:08.619
Because He lives, I will preach the gospel.

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:10.499
Am I?

00:41:10.499 --> 00:41:12.699
Will I?

00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:17.299
Because He lives, I will endure hardship.

00:41:17.299 --> 00:41:24.859
Paul tells Timothy in 2 Timothy 2 to endure hardness as a good soldier.

00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:27.979
You know what he says to him just a few verses after that?

00:41:27.979 --> 00:41:31.939
Remember that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.

00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:34.299
Wow.

00:41:34.299 --> 00:41:36.059
I will endure hardship, why?

00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:38.219
Because my Savior lives.

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:42.699
And I will live for Him because He lives.

00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:48.259
We live in a generation, we live in a society, it's all about me.

00:41:48.259 --> 00:41:49.259
What makes me happy?

00:41:49.259 --> 00:41:51.219
What do I want to do?

00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:52.219
What do you want to do?

00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:57.579
But we ought to start asking the question of, what does God want me to do?

00:41:57.579 --> 00:41:58.579
Because I want to live for Him.

00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:03.499
I want to live a life that's pleasing in His sight, proving what is acceptable in the sight

00:42:03.499 --> 00:42:04.499
of the Lord.

00:42:04.499 --> 00:42:07.939
And because He lives, I will live for Him.

00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:09.099
He's coming again.

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:16.019
I don't know the hour or the day, but I know that He lives and one day I will see Him.

00:42:16.019 --> 00:42:17.019
Let's pray together.

00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:18.559
Father, we love You.

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:20.579
We thank You for loving us.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:24.459
We thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together this morning.

00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:29.859
We thank You for the truth of Your Word, the power of Your Word.

00:42:29.859 --> 00:42:35.719
We're so thankful for the resurrection because we're mindful this morning of this wonderful

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.139
Bible truth.

00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:43.919
We've asked ourselves the question of, how has this truth impacted me?

00:42:43.919 --> 00:42:51.519
How has my behavior been altered because I serve a risen Savior?

00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:59.119
We see these three aspects of the life of the Apostle Paul as we've examined these passages

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:00.119
of Scripture this morning.

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:06.159
I pray that You'd help us to be honest with You and honest with ourselves.

00:43:06.159 --> 00:43:09.759
Are we preaching the gospel?

00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:12.919
Are we enduring hardness?

00:43:12.919 --> 00:43:15.999
Are we living for Christ?

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:21.519
I pray that in this time of invitation that we'd do business with You, that we'd allow

00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:25.919
You, Lord, to have Your will and way in our hearts and lives.

00:43:25.919 --> 00:43:28.879
And if we're not preaching the gospel, if we're not enduring hardness, if we're not

00:43:28.879 --> 00:43:33.239
living for You, would You help us to get that settled this morning?

00:43:33.239 --> 00:43:37.159
Help us, Lord, to make those commitments to You this morning and that as we leave this

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:45.919
place we'd be changed because of how we've been impacted by the resurrection of our Savior.

00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:51.159
Perhaps there's one in our presence this morning that's not sure of heaven.

00:43:51.159 --> 00:44:00.599
In fact, if you were to be asked this question, if you were to die today, are you 100 percent

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:04.119
sure that you'd go to heaven?

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:09.679
Perhaps this morning you cannot answer that question with confidence and with assurance

00:44:09.679 --> 00:44:12.119
that heaven is your home.

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:15.759
There's never been a time in your life when you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your

00:44:15.759 --> 00:44:17.959
personal Savior.

00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:22.399
Could I tell you today that the gospel is for you?

00:44:22.399 --> 00:44:29.759
Can I tell you today that the Word of God says, behold, today is the day of salvation?

00:44:29.759 --> 00:44:33.599
We'd like to invite you to come and we'd take a Bible and show you how you could know for

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:39.799
sure that heaven is your home, could leave this place knowing with certainty and with

00:44:39.799 --> 00:44:45.959
confidence that if you were to die, or when you die, that heaven is your home.

00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:51.359
Oh, God, I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only You can.

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:56.639
We pray that in these few moments that You'd be exalted and magnified, for it's in Christ's

00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:57.639
name we pray.

00:44:57.639 --> 00:44:59.359
Would You stand with me?

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:02.719
For those visiting with us at the end of each of our services, we have an invitation

00:45:02.719 --> 00:45:03.719
time.

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:05.119
That's where we give you an opportunity.

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:09.399
No one's looking around, heads are bowed, eyes are closed, and the piano will play here

00:45:09.399 --> 00:45:11.159
in just a moment.

00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:15.399
And as the piano plays, the altar will be open and we'd invite you to come and maybe

00:45:15.399 --> 00:45:19.679
you need to make some type of commitment to the Lord, ask Him to help you to live for

00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:24.119
Him, ask Him to help you to preach the gospel as you ought, to endure hardship.

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:26.559
But maybe this morning you're not sure of heaven.

00:45:27.079 --> 00:45:30.199
Oh, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your

00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:31.239
home.

00:45:31.239 --> 00:45:36.079
We would not want you to leave this place without knowing with confidence, with assurance

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:37.799
that heaven is your home.

00:45:37.799 --> 00:45:41.319
Jared will play quietly on the piano, and as he does, the altar is open.
