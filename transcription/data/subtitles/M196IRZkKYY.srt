1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
Number one, how appropriate as we were singing our last song, our last congregational song,

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,039
it fits so well with the message for this evening.

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,559
And the song title is, You're All on the Altar, and I hope that as we were singing

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:24,680
this evening that we were meditating upon the words of that song, how thought-provoking

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,719
and soul-searching the words of this particular hymn are.

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:34,779
And the title of the message this evening from the book of Philippians is this, Who

7
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,880
Are You Living For?

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,000
And Philippians 1 and verse number 21, the Apostle Paul says, For to me to live is Christ

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,279
and to die is gain.

10
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:52,000
And I simply ask the question in our message title this evening, who are you living for?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
C.T.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,279
Studd said, Only one life will soon be passed.

13
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,919
Only what's done for Christ shall last.

14
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:06,559
I'm mindful of one of my Bible college professors, and he had a successful career as an engineer

15
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,800
prior to his salvation and call to ministry.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,120
And he'd been working for a number of years and had been dealing with, of course, he trusted

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,879
Christ as a Savior and dealing with the thought of ministry for a number of years after that,

18
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:28,319
still working faithfully in the corporate world and had a successful job and career.

19
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,839
And as he was struggling with the thought of serving the Lord full-time and working

20
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:39,160
in the ministry as a pastor, he felt the Lord was calling him to the ministry and he was

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,800
just dealing with that process.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,279
And if you have felt the call or you've been called, you might understand some of what

23
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,080
that struggle might look like.

24
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:55,919
And he was dealing with several of those things, and it was a particular occasion as they were

25
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:02,080
rolling out some new machinery that he had the opportunity to help design.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,320
And as he had worked and helped design that machinery, and they had a big, just a ceremony,

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,960
if you will, ribbon cutting and all of these sort of things, and as they would get rid

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,479
of the outdated old system, they brought the new system in, and it was a day in which

29
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,479
to be celebrated.

30
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:29,639
It was a day to be really full of just accomplishment and rejoicing as to what was able to be accomplished.

31
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,160
But as he had been struggling for a period of time at that particular moment in his life

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,240
with regard to serving the Lord full-time in the ministry or to continue in that path

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,360
as he had been on, he was really struggling.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,639
And all he could consider on that particular day was that at some point, whoever had put

35
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,639
that existing machinery in there, they probably had a similar type of a ceremony and celebration

36
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,600
as they brought in the new and did away with the old.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,279
And now, however long later, he was part of that new group.

38
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:10,520
And he knew this, that at some point, his design, the machinery, that would be replaced

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,679
by something new, something better, something faster, more efficient, so on and so forth.

40
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:23,520
And I believe that, as I recall sitting in classes with this particular professor and

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,279
hearing his testimony on a regular basis and understanding this quote from C.T.

42
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,800
God, how powerful it is.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,360
And it is true that as we live our lives, that we are to live for eternity, in light

44
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
of eternity.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,440
No, God doesn't call everyone to the ministry.

46
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,440
God doesn't call everyone to serve as a pastor or missionary or evangelist.

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,199
But we do find that he does give us the responsibility to live our lives for Christ.

48
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,279
Whatever we find ourselves, whatever capacity it is that we find ourselves in, we understand

49
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:03,639
that God has placed us in that place for a purpose.

50
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,919
And yes, some of those purposes might be to provide for our families and so on and so

51
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,919
forth.

52
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,559
And absolutely, that's true.

53
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:18,079
But we find that ultimately, God has us in the places that he has us so that we could

54
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,959
be light, so that we could be his representatives in those places.

55
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,880
There are people that you come into contact with, there are people that I came into contact

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,239
with when I worked in the corporate world for many years that my pastor would never

57
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,239
meet.

58
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:38,600
It just never was going to happen that my pastor would ever sit down and have lunch

59
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,119
with some of the colleagues that I had when I worked in the corporate world.

60
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:47,320
And it's unlikely that I'll probably have lunch with some of your colleagues.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,600
And so God has placed you there.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,399
God had placed me in that particular setting with an opportunity to be a representative

63
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,519
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

64
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,600
We find that the Bible teaches us very plainly and very clearly the truth of the brevity

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
of life.

66
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,519
I think that C.T.

67
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:15,160
Studd was really capturing that idea, only one life, he says this, will soon be past.

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,679
And the Bible teaches us the truth of the brevity of life.

69
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:25,000
And the fact that the Bible says in James that our life is like a vapor that appeareth

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,600
for a little time and then it vanisheth away, and we can consider the brevity of life and

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,320
understand those truths, and we know as believers that we've been given the responsibility to

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:46,359
redeem the time and to understand that these days that God has given us to dwell here upon

73
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:53,880
the earth are few and we have opportunities that will soon be past.

74
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,920
The song that we sang this evening is, You're All on the Altar, and we think about this

75
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,959
song and if we answer the song with the answer of, yes, my all is on the altar, then there

76
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,440
will be no question who it is that we're living for.

77
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,480
Seems pretty obvious that if our all is on the altar, then we are living for Christ.

78
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,279
We're not living for self, we're living for Christ.

79
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,920
As I think about the song and I think about some of what we've dealt with even in recent

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,320
days as we've studied the book of Joshua, and we dealt with the first lesson there at

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,880
the end of the eighth chapter when they made those offerings, and we spoke about how they

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,679
offered burnt offerings and they sacrificed peace offerings upon that altar when Joshua

83
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:43,799
built the altar according to what was commanded by Moses there in Deuteronomy in chapter 27,

84
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,799
and we find the fulfillment.

85
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:50,519
And if you watched that particular Joshua lesson, you understand that I gave application

86
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:58,359
to how we as New Testament believers, we are to offer, give our bodies as a living sacrifice.

87
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,320
Paul mentions that in Romans chapter number 12 in verses 1 and 2, and it's a powerful

88
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,440
passage of scripture where Paul says, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of

89
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,880
God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which

90
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,019
is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing

91
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,320
of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

92
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,720
As we think about the truth and the challenge, if you will, that Paul presents to the believers

93
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,640
in Rome when he says, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that ye present

94
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,720
your bodies a living sacrifice, Paul was not giving them a challenge to do something that

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,000
he had not already done.

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,799
Yes, it was true that Paul was challenging the believers in Rome that they were to give

97
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:56,760
and they were to make their bodies a living sacrifice unto the Lord, but we understand

98
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,480
that Paul would give this declaration in Galatians 2, in verse number 20, where he would speak

99
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,200
of his own personal testimony, and he says, I am crucified with Christ.

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,260
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live

101
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,980
in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

102
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,540
I believe that as you study the Scriptures, as you study the New Testament, you will find

103
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,659
that the Apostle Paul is one of the greatest examples of a man who was absolutely surrendered

104
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,859
to the will of God.

105
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,859
There are others, no doubt, that we could look to and we could see their example of

106
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:48,460
how they lived for the Lord and how they served the Lord and how they were crucified

107
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,219
with Christ, but as you trace the steps of the Apostle Paul, beginning in Acts chapter

108
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:58,299
number 9, after his conversion, of course, he's called Saul, and that passage of Scripture,

109
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:03,500
his name would then later be changed to Paul, and we've come to refer to him as the Apostle

110
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,659
Paul.

111
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:09,299
And we find that as you study his life and you trace his steps during those missionary

112
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:16,500
journeys, he was a man that was absolutely surrendered to the will of God for his life.

113
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,780
He was living for Jesus.

114
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,659
We sing that hymn, by the way, Living for Jesus.

115
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,460
What a great hymn that is.

116
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,780
And we think about the importance of living our lives.

117
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,419
That song that we would sing is a powerful song, but it's a convicting song.

118
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:36,460
See, that's one of the things that I love about singing the old hymns.

119
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,859
When we sing those songs, we are confronted with truth.

120
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:46,340
We are thinking about the words, and as we sing those songs, it's not just that we're

121
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,299
seeking to fill up some time and space in our services.

122
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,739
No, the songs are intended to convict us.

123
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:59,059
In fact, there are times in which, if we'd be honest this evening, we could have an invitation

124
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,979
after the song.

125
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:06,139
service. I think about one of the hymns that we sang last Sunday morning, I

126
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:12,859
surrender all. I surrender all. Man, that's a convicting song. And when we're

127
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:20,499
singing it, I wonder if we're really realizing what we're singing. I surrender

128
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:29,879
all. Not some, not most, but all. We know that our songbook is full of wonderful

129
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,519
songs that are thought-provoking, convicting songs. See, the Apostle Paul

130
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,879
had no problem declaring who he was living for. We find that he says to us

131
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,159
here in this passage of Scripture that is before us in Philippians 1 and verse

132
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:54,319
number 21, he says, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. I want you to

133
00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:01,079
capture some of the, really, the context of what the Apostle Paul is saying. Back

134
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,439
up, if you will, to the twelfth verse of chapter number one of the book of

135
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,799
Philippians, and we could look at the first eleven verses and see the

136
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,459
greetings and the place that the people at Philippi had in the heart of the

137
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,279
Apostle Paul and his love, care, and concern for these believers at Philippi.

138
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,239
And we can rejoice in that relationship that had been established through the

139
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,199
missionary journey, the second missionary journey, when the Apostle Paul had the

140
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,259
privilege of being able to serve in that community. We believe that the book of

141
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,199
Philippians was written somewhere between 10 and 13 years after his first

142
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:42,279
arrival in Philippi in that ministry. Of course, the book of Philippians is a book

143
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,599
in which we can speak about rejoicing and joy, and he tells us in the fourth

144
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:51,519
chapter, a verse that is extremely familiar to many of us, in verse number

145
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,599
four, rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice. Paul's writing from

146
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:05,679
prison, yet he's telling him about rejoicing. Isn't that wonderful? We find that

147
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,239
Paul begins in verse number 12 to capture the context of that great

148
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,479
statement that is made in verse number 21. Notice what he says,

149
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:20,079
but I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened

150
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,399
unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel. We could spend

151
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,359
the entirety of our time this evening just focusing on the truth of verse

152
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:34,479
number 12 and how the Apostle Paul had a proper perspective of his life. He

153
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,439
understood the sovereignty of God. He understood what we spoke about this

154
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:43,399
morning, remembering that the Lord is still on his throne and God is in

155
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,919
control. And the Apostle Paul says, there's something that I understand

156
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,599
about my current circumstances, but I want you to understand it as well. I

157
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:57,559
don't want you to be ignorant of these things, I want you to be aware. He said, I

158
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,199
would ye should understand, brethren, notice what he says, that the things

159
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:07,479
which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the

160
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:11,519
gospel. There are times in which we can look at our circumstances and we can say,

161
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,879
woe is me, look at how unfortunate these things are, and look at all of these

162
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,839
things that I'm dealing with. But the Apostle Paul said, no, these things that

163
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,799
have happened have happened for the furtherance of the gospel. And he says

164
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,719
this in verse 13, so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace

165
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:35,079
and in all other places. Notice what Paul's saying. He's saying, I have

166
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,879
opportunities to share the gospel with people because of my circumstances that

167
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:48,519
otherwise I would not have had. That's a good perspective on life. I hope that

168
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,279
this evening, as we look at the book of Philippians and just review a few of

169
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,079
these things, that we would be challenged by the perspective of the Apostle Paul,

170
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,599
and we find that he speaks about the opportunities that the Lord would give

171
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:07,519
him given his current circumstances. And in the last part of the book of

172
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,519
Philippians, in chapter 4 and verse 22, he says this, all the saints salute you,

173
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,119
chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. What a blessing. There are some

174
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:24,159
people that got saved because Paul was in that place. Verse 14, and many of the

175
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,319
brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the

176
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:35,559
word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and strife, and some

177
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,999
also of goodwill. The one preached Christ of contention, not sincerely,

178
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:43,359
supposing to add affliction to my bonds, but the other of love, knowing that I am

179
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:49,239
set for the defense of the gospel. What then? Notwithstanding, every way, whether

180
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:55,119
in pretense or in truth, notice, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, yea,

181
00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:02,799
and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation

182
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,679
through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to

183
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,639
my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with

184
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,319
that with all boldness as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my

185
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:27,079
body, whether it be by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die

186
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:33,039
is gain. I notice as we look at the passage of Scripture, a commitment that

187
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,079
the Apostle Paul had made. I do not believe that Philippians 121, as we've

188
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,759
quoted it often, and maybe some of God's people over the years have used this

189
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,959
verse as maybe a life verse, if you will, and certainly it's an appropriate life

190
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,959
verse. It's appropriate for us to say, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is

191
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,599
gain, and we see the truth in this verse of Scripture with regard to the

192
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:05,879
life that I'm now living, that I would live this life for Christ, and that when

193
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,879
I, as Peter said in 2 Peter 1, put off this my earthly tabernacle, that I'll be

194
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:18,039
with Christ, that I will have that gain, and to die is gain. He goes on to mention

195
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,039
about the struggle that he was dealing with. He says in verse 23, I'm in a

196
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,159
strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far

197
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,839
better, and so Paul was assured of his salvation. Paul was absolutely confident

198
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,159
and to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. He knew that

199
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,959
truth. He proclaimed that truth, but Paul says, for to me to live is Christ. It's

200
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:51,559
not a cliche. It's a commitment. Every day of my life, I want it to count for Christ.

201
00:16:52,039 --> 00:17:00,319
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. I believe that there are some

202
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:05,679
things that Paul constantly remembered in his life that led him to making such

203
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,839
a commitment. If you will, just turn over with me to a couple of passages. We'll

204
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,319
just look at a couple. Look in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6. We'll look

205
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,119
at one in 2 Corinthians, and then we'll be back to the book of Philippians, but

206
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,999
notice in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, in verses 19 and 20, again a familiar

207
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:27,859
passage of Scripture to us, but I believe that some of these things that Paul

208
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,959
often preached were things that he meditated upon himself and things that he

209
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:37,359
recalled on a regular basis. You find that as you study the life of the

210
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,279
Apostle Paul, I believe that I could say with accuracy that he never got over the

211
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,839
fact that he was saved. I don't think he ever forgot what happened on the road to

212
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:53,359
Damascus. You find that as he would stand before many and give his testimony that

213
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,039
he refers back to that day, and all that was taking place, and how he had been

214
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,999
saved, and what joy filled his heart and his life knowing that he belonged to

215
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,679
Jesus. In 1 Corinthians 6 and verses 19 and 20, he says to the believers in

216
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,359
Corinth, he says, what? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy

217
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:19,199
Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God? And notice where he says, and ye are

218
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:26,879
not your own, for you're bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body

219
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:33,479
and in your spirit, which are God's. See, Paul understood the price that was paid

220
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:39,440
for his redemption. To redeem means to buy back. We speak about the truth of

221
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,880
redemption throughout the Scriptures, and we find if you were to study the first

222
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,440
chapter of the book of Ephesians, you would look at the plan of redemption and

223
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,119
you would see the price for redemption, and that is the precious blood of Christ.

224
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,719
We find that Peter deals with that truth in 1 Peter chapter 1, that we're

225
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:01,000
not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold. No, we're redeemed

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,760
with the precious blood of Christ. We find that Ephesians goes on to deal with

227
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,519
the proof of our redemption, the fact that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us,

228
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,199
and we see here in this passage how that the Apostle Paul connects those

229
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:20,199
things. He says that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost. He tells us two

230
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:24,919
very important things. Number one, we're not our own. You go through life and you

231
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,359
hear people say, I'm my own man. I do what I want to do. I'm my own, you know,

232
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:38,559
whatever, and the reality is that as God's people, we're not our own. We've

233
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,839
been bought with a price, and that price is the precious blood of our Savior, God

234
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:53,279
in flesh, Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. If you were to read the gospel accounts

235
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,199
and read the end of each gospel account, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and read the

236
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,039
account of the

237
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,519
of the crucifixion,

238
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,219
you will see the price that was paid

239
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,119
for your redemption.

240
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,439
And I would submit to you

241
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,679
that the Apostle Paul,

242
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,599
as he would consider this commitment

243
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,739
when he would say for me to live as Christ

244
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,299
and to die as Gain,

245
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,379
he would understand,

246
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,599
he would have this knowledge

247
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,079
of the fact that he was not his own,

248
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,639
that he was bought with a price,

249
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,059
and he concludes,

250
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,419
since I'm not my own,

251
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,239
since I was bought with a price,

252
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,999
therefore, the natural conclusion

253
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,399
that we reach based upon that truth

254
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,179
is that we are to glorify God

255
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,039
in our bodies.

256
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:40,879
He says this,

257
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,519
therefore, glorify God in your body

258
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,959
and in your spirit which are God's.

259
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,079
He would say there in 1 Corinthians 10

260
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,919
and verse 31,

261
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,759
you don't need to turn there,

262
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,579
but he says,

263
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,419
therefore, whether you eat or drink

264
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,819
or whatsoever you do,

265
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,419
do all to the glory of God.

266
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,299
In 2 Corinthians 5,

267
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,619
what led to the commitment?

268
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,539
Because I see in Philippians 1 and verse 21,

269
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,659
I see a great declaration

270
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,859
that the Apostle Paul would make there

271
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,299
in that passage of Scripture,

272
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,019
but I find more than just a declaration,

273
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,299
I see a commitment daily

274
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,459
that I'm going to live for Christ.

275
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:19,659
I believe the truth here

276
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,259
in 2 Corinthians 5,

277
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,619
I preached on this passage of Scripture

278
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,659
several Sunday mornings ago.

279
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,739
He reconciled.

280
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,499
And we find that in verse 14

281
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,579
of 2 Corinthians 5,

282
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,399
the Bible says,

283
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,379
for the love of Christ constraineth us

284
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,499
because we thus judge

285
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:36,579
that if one died for all,

286
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,019
then we're all dead.

287
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,379
And then he died for all

288
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,259
that they which live

289
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,899
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

290
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:47,659
but unto him which died for them

291
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:50,379
and rose again.

292
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,099
Those of you that have received

293
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:54,299
any sort of correspondence from me

294
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,619
over the years,

295
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,099
know that 2 Corinthians 5

296
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,939
and verse 15 is a verse

297
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:01,459
that I put in emails,

298
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,339
letters, cards,

299
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,859
whatever that I send out.

300
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,579
This verse of Scripture

301
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,139
has had a profound impact upon my life.

302
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,699
I mentioned the song that we sing,

303
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,059
Living for Jesus,

304
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,259
and we find here

305
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,379
that in the verse of Scripture,

306
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,339
he says in that he died for all

307
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,859
that they which live

308
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:28,699
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

309
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:31,899
no, but unto him which died for them

310
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:34,539
and rose again.

311
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,979
So often, I think in our culture,

312
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,819
we've been given this mindset

313
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,219
and this perspective of

314
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:46,139
what are you going to do with your life?

315
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,939
Young people hear it all of the time.

316
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:50,139
My children are getting older.

317
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,819
And 13, 15, and 17,

318
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:54,019
it's hard to believe,

319
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,259
Juliana had her birthday last week,

320
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,099
turned 17.

321
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,859
She's gonna be a senior in high school.

322
00:22:58,859 --> 00:22:59,699
And as such,

323
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:01,099
will be asked the question

324
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,259
hundreds of times.

325
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,339
She's already been asked the question

326
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,339
plenty of times.

327
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,499
What are you going to do?

328
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:08,339
We remember,

329
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,579
those of us that were seniors in high school,

330
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,779
we remember being asked that question.

331
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,219
Even before you're a senior,

332
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:15,059
you get asked,

333
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:15,899
what are you gonna do?

334
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:16,739
Where are you gonna go to college?

335
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:17,619
What are you gonna do with your life?

336
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,219
So on and so forth.

337
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:22,339
And I have submitted to many over the years

338
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,659
that a better question is not

339
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,059
what do I want to do with my life,

340
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,739
but what does the Lord want me to do with my life?

341
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,099
As the people of God,

342
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,259
as people that understand redemption,

343
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,499
as people that understand the truth of the Word of God,

344
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,019
we ought to make this commitment that Paul made

345
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,139
for me to live as Christ and to die as Gain.

346
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,499
And what is it that the Lord wants me to do?

347
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:46,339
Again, not every person will be a missionary

348
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:47,859
or a pastor,

349
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,579
but we have to understand

350
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,659
what does God want with my life?

351
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,459
We know through the revealed will of God

352
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,579
that He wants us to live for Him.

353
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,579
He wants us to live for Him.

354
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,539
He doesn't want us to live for self.

355
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,819
He wants us to live for Christ.

356
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,619
We find there in the book of Philippians,

357
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,499
I mentioned that we'd get back there in just a moment.

358
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,499
Look, we're looking at the first chapter.

359
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,019
Look at chapter number three.

360
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,619
In chapter number three,

361
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,899
the Bible gives us some truth

362
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,339
with regard to the life of Paul

363
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,779
and some of the things that he deals with.

364
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,659
And he says in verse number four,

365
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,859
though I might also have confidence in the flesh,

366
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,819
if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof,

367
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:31,419
he might trust in the flesh, I more.

368
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:32,699
Circumcised the eighth day,

369
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:34,659
the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin

370
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,539
and Hebrew of the Hebrews is touching the law of Pharisee.

371
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:39,419
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church,

372
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,139
touching the righteousness which is in the law,

373
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,619
blameless, verse seven.

374
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,179
But what things were gained to me,

375
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,499
those I counted loss for Christ.

376
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:51,379
Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss

377
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,939
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,

378
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,299
my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things

379
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,339
and do count them but dung,

380
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,899
that I may win Christ and be found in him,

381
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,739
not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law,

382
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,739
but that which is through the faith of Christ,

383
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,739
the righteousness which is of God by faith,

384
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:15,219
that I may know him and the power of his resurrection

385
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,699
and the fellowship of his sufferings,

386
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,219
being made conformable unto his death.

387
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:22,579
If by any means I might attain

388
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:23,979
unto the resurrection of the dead,

389
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,979
not as though I had already attained,

390
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:28,939
either were already perfect, but I followed after.

391
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:30,459
If that, notice where he says,

392
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:35,459
I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended

393
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,459
of Christ Jesus.

394
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,339
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

395
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,539
but this one thing I do,

396
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,299
forgetting those things which are behind

397
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,459
and reaching forth unto those things which are before,

398
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:51,539
I press toward the mark for the prize

399
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,539
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

400
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,379
Paul says, for to me to live is Christ

401
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,459
and to die is gain.

402
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,259
He made a commitment.

403
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:06,819
Again, this is not some sort of cliche.

404
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,779
It's a commitment that Paul made.

405
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,099
I believe that as the recipients

406
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:12,779
of this wonderful letter that we call

407
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,739
the book of Philippians,

408
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,339
that as they received and read,

409
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,179
I believe that many within the congregation

410
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,579
of the church at Philippi,

411
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,979
they would agree with what Paul is saying.

412
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:25,819
They had the privilege of seeing his life and ministry

413
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:28,459
and they would understand exactly what he was meaning

414
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,059
when he said, for to me to live is Christ

415
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:30,899
and to die is gain.

416
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,539
I believe that in that phraseology

417
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,379
and in that statement,

418
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:37,059
that there's not only a commitment,

419
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,619
but there's also a level of conviction

420
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,099
upon the people that are reading

421
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,739
the truth that's been given.

422
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:44,819
Could I say that?

423
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:48,259
I wonder as the believers in Philippi

424
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,019
receive the letter and they read it for the first time,

425
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:54,139
I wonder if any amongst them would say,

426
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,859
I wonder if I could say that.

427
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,259
I wonder if I could say that,

428
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,139
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

429
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,219
There's a level there of conviction

430
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,739
when you read about the commitment that was made.

431
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:11,339
And I wonder this evening,

432
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:15,099
if any had had that thought on whether or not

433
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,259
they too could make that comment,

434
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,459
if they could make that declaration.

435
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:22,339
I wonder this evening,

436
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,859
if there were some that were saying,

437
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,899
I need to be in that place

438
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,659
where I could make the same commitment

439
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,059
that the Apostle Paul made,

440
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,099
for to me to live is Christ.

441
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,859
Can I tell you that you would never regret

442
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,219
living for Christ?

443
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:38,659
Remember the quote that we started this evening

444
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,899
from C.T. Studd,

445
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:42,619
only when life will soon be passed,

446
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,539
only what's done for Christ will last.

447
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,619
It's interesting as we look at the commitment

448
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:50,739
of the Apostle Paul and we see what he says

449
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:53,419
and really the focus of our message this evening

450
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:55,979
is dealing with what led to that commitment

451
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,059
and the commitment itself.

452
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,259
But I want you to notice in the book of Philippians

453
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,619
in the second chapter,

454
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,819
I want you to see a contrast that the Lord gives us.

455
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,619
And as we look at this contrast

456
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,459
in Philippians chapter number two,

457
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:10,859
beginning in verse number 19,

458
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,659
I want you to see what the Apostle Paul says.

459
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,179
Now remember, he's writing from prison

460
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,819
and he tells them in verse number 19,

461
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,579
but I trust and in Philippians two in verse 19,

462
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,659
but I trust in the Lord Jesus

463
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,139
to send Timotheus shortly unto you,

464
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:31,379
that I also may be of good comfort

465
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,899
when I know your state.

466
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,259
So we understand the Apostle Paul

467
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:38,899
had had communication with the believers in Philippi,

468
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,859
they sent and communicated with him.

469
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,259
If you read the fourth chapter,

470
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:45,139
you see their involvement in his ministry and what have you,

471
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,099
but you find here that the Apostle Paul

472
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,579
had an interest in knowing the state of the flock,

473
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:52,699
knowing the state of the church in Philippi.

474
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:55,699
He himself was not able to go and just travel

475
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,659
and go over there to Philippi

476
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,539
and find out how things were going.

477
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,019
So he would send Timothy in his place.

478
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,940
It's interesting as you kind of on a side note,

479
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,820
as you notice often throughout the epistles

480
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,619
that the Apostle Paul is concerned

481
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:15,739
about those that God allowed him to minister to.

482
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,739
He speaks to the believers in Thessalonica.

483
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,579
We looked at 1 Thessalonians 2 last Sunday morning

484
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:23,339
and you look in the passages there

485
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,459
in the book of 1 Thessalonians

486
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,019
and you see that Paul was going to send Timothy

487
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,139
to find out how they were doing.

488
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:31,099
He was concerned for them.

489
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,820
He says this in 2 Corinthians,

490
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,659
you don't need to turn there,

491
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,579
but chapter 11 and verse 21,

492
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,380
he says beside those things that are without,

493
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,139
that which cometh upon me daily,

494
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,619
the care of all the churches.

495
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:45,179
The Apostle Paul wanted to know their state.

496
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,339
So he's going to send Timothy, verse 20,

497
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,859
notice what he says in Philippians 2 and verse 20,

498
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,859
for I have no man like minded

499
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,619
who will naturally care for your state.

500
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,579
And then notice this truth in verse 21,

501
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,179
for all seek their own.

502
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:07,979
not the things which are Jesus Christ.

503
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,319
But ye know the proof of Him

504
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,819
that as a son with the Father,

505
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:14,739
He hath served me in the gospel."

506
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:19,079
Verse 22 is a testimony of Timothy.

507
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,619
He's going back and speaking about

508
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,819
the testimony of Timothy.

509
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,079
That's why he's going to send Timothy to them

510
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,099
because of the testimony that he has.

511
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,539
But I want you to notice the contrast

512
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,859
between what Paul says in Philippians 1

513
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:32,899
and verse 21 of himself.

514
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,739
For to me to live is Christ

515
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,259
and to die is gain.

516
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,859
And what he says of those in Philippians 2

517
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:40,299
and verse 21,

518
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,819
for all seek their own,

519
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:48,099
not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

520
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,779
What sad commentary is given

521
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,219
in Philippians 2 and verse 21?

522
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,979
I've asked the question this evening,

523
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,099
who are you living for?

524
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:59,619
We sang the song as our final

525
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,739
congregational song.

526
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,899
I love it when it works this way.

527
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,339
I didn't ask Holly to pick songs this week.

528
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,859
I mean, I asked her to pick them,

529
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,539
but I didn't tell her which songs to pick.

530
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,779
She just picked the songs.

531
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,379
And she told me what they were.

532
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,739
And honestly, the only thought that I had

533
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,659
wasn't so much with what songs they were,

534
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:17,939
but the fact that we had at least

535
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:20,099
one patriotic song this morning.

536
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,459
And I didn't give much thought

537
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,659
to the songs and which order they were in

538
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:24,699
and all of those things.

539
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,019
She was handling that.

540
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,419
And I appreciate her doing that.

541
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,899
And as we turn to that last hymn this evening,

542
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,459
I didn't realize until we got up here

543
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,139
until we were singing our theme song,

544
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:38,499
I didn't realize that the last hymn

545
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:39,539
that we would sing tonight

546
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,059
is, You're All on the Altar.

547
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,299
And as we sang that song,

548
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:45,419
and actually when Jared was still

549
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,939
leading the theme song as we were singing it,

550
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,219
I was thinking how appropriate

551
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,859
is, You're All on the Altar,

552
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:53,339
and I'm preaching a message,

553
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:56,299
who are you living for?

554
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,859
And if we can sing that song

555
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,099
that we sang this evening,

556
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:03,619
and we can say, yes, my all is on the altar,

557
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,499
then the answer's obvious.

558
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,179
I'm living for Christ.

559
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:08,899
For me to live is Christ,

560
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:10,539
and to die is gain.

561
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,139
I don't want to be categorized

562
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,500
as those unnamed people

563
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,059
in Philippians 2.21

564
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,019
that Paul concludes of them

565
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,339
that they seek their own

566
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:24,259
and not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

567
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,500
I'd rather stand understanding

568
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,819
what the Lord has done for me,

569
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,500
understanding that I'm not my own,

570
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,299
I've been bought with a price.

571
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:37,659
And being able to stand and say

572
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,779
for me to live is Christ,

573
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,379
to die is gain.

574
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:42,659
Does it mean that I'm going to be perfect

575
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:43,779
or you're going to be perfect?

576
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,699
Absolutely not.

577
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,739
But it means that every day

578
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:49,299
we make a conscience decision

579
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:52,299
that today, I want to live for Jesus.

580
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:53,619
It's not about me.

581
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,500
I'm not crucified with Christ.

582
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,299
I have followed the call

583
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,379
that was issued in Romans 12.

584
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,579
I beseech you therefore, brethren,

585
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:06,459
by the mercies of God,

586
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:07,539
that you present your bodies

587
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,939
a living sacrifice,

588
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,419
holy, acceptable unto God,

589
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,139
He says, which is your reasonable service,

590
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,019
that I could say,

591
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,819
for to me to live is Christ,

592
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,619
and to die is gain.

593
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,819
Who are you living for?

594
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:22,819
Father, we love You

595
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:25,500
and we thank You for loving us.

596
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,739
We thank You that You

597
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:36,819
have a perfect plan.

598
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:37,699
And in that plan,

599
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,059
You sent Your Son,

600
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,539
the Lord Jesus Christ,

601
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,539
to come to this incursed world

602
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,219
to live a perfect, sinless life,

603
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:48,299
to die, to be buried,

604
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,819
to rise in victory,

605
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,139
to redeem us.

606
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:54,699
We know that that plan of redemption

607
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,339
was a plan that was determined

608
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,739
before the foundation of the world,

609
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,299
that Jesus is the Lamb of God

610
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,500
that was slain

611
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
before the foundation of the world.

612
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,459
We know that as we study

613
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:06,500
the book of Ephesians,

614
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,139
that the text of Scripture

615
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,139
is dealing with the how of salvation,

616
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,899
not the who of salvation,

617
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,939
and for that we rejoice.

618
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:18,899
And God, I pray that as Your people,

619
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,419
those of us that have been redeemed,

620
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,019
as we sing,

621
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,779
redeemed how I love to proclaim it,

622
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:28,220
redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,

623
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,419
Lord, that we would understand

624
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,100
that we're not our own,

625
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,459
that we've been bought with a price,

626
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,660
that we could say I am crucified with Christ,

627
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,739
that we could say with Paul,

628
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,699
for to me to live is Christ,

629
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,380
and to die is gain.

630
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,619
Living for Jesus, Lord,

631
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,019
that's our desire,

632
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,899
that our lives would count for Christ,

633
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:51,820
that You would enable us

634
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,500
to make an impact upon eternity,

635
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,619
and we'll thank You for it.

636
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:56,019
During this time of invitation,

637
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,259
would You move in hearts and lives,

638
00:34:58,259 --> 00:34:59,779
would You alone be glorified?

639
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,059
We'll thank You for what You'll do,

640
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,899
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
