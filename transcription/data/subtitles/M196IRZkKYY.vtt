WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.039
Number one, how appropriate as we were singing our last song, our last congregational song,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.039
it fits so well with the message for this evening.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.559
And the song title is, You're All on the Altar, and I hope that as we were singing

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:24.680
this evening that we were meditating upon the words of that song, how thought-provoking

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.719
and soul-searching the words of this particular hymn are.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:34.779
And the title of the message this evening from the book of Philippians is this, Who

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:36.880
Are You Living For?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.000
And Philippians 1 and verse number 21, the Apostle Paul says, For to me to live is Christ

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.279
and to die is gain.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:52.000
And I simply ask the question in our message title this evening, who are you living for?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
C.T.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.279
Studd said, Only one life will soon be passed.

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.919
Only what's done for Christ shall last.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:06.559
I'm mindful of one of my Bible college professors, and he had a successful career as an engineer

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:09.800
prior to his salvation and call to ministry.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.120
And he'd been working for a number of years and had been dealing with, of course, he trusted

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.879
Christ as a Savior and dealing with the thought of ministry for a number of years after that,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:28.319
still working faithfully in the corporate world and had a successful job and career.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.839
And as he was struggling with the thought of serving the Lord full-time and working

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:39.160
in the ministry as a pastor, he felt the Lord was calling him to the ministry and he was

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800
just dealing with that process.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.279
And if you have felt the call or you've been called, you might understand some of what

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.080
that struggle might look like.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:55.919
And he was dealing with several of those things, and it was a particular occasion as they were

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:02.080
rolling out some new machinery that he had the opportunity to help design.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.320
And as he had worked and helped design that machinery, and they had a big, just a ceremony,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.960
if you will, ribbon cutting and all of these sort of things, and as they would get rid

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.479
of the outdated old system, they brought the new system in, and it was a day in which

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.479
to be celebrated.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:29.639
It was a day to be really full of just accomplishment and rejoicing as to what was able to be accomplished.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.160
But as he had been struggling for a period of time at that particular moment in his life

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.240
with regard to serving the Lord full-time in the ministry or to continue in that path

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.360
as he had been on, he was really struggling.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.639
And all he could consider on that particular day was that at some point, whoever had put

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:55.639
that existing machinery in there, they probably had a similar type of a ceremony and celebration

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.600
as they brought in the new and did away with the old.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.279
And now, however long later, he was part of that new group.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:10.520
And he knew this, that at some point, his design, the machinery, that would be replaced

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.679
by something new, something better, something faster, more efficient, so on and so forth.

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:23.520
And I believe that, as I recall sitting in classes with this particular professor and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.279
hearing his testimony on a regular basis and understanding this quote from C.T.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.800
God, how powerful it is.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.360
And it is true that as we live our lives, that we are to live for eternity, in light

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360
of eternity.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.440
No, God doesn't call everyone to the ministry.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.440
God doesn't call everyone to serve as a pastor or missionary or evangelist.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.199
But we do find that he does give us the responsibility to live our lives for Christ.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.279
Whatever we find ourselves, whatever capacity it is that we find ourselves in, we understand

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.639
that God has placed us in that place for a purpose.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.919
And yes, some of those purposes might be to provide for our families and so on and so

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.919
forth.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.559
And absolutely, that's true.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:18.079
But we find that ultimately, God has us in the places that he has us so that we could

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.959
be light, so that we could be his representatives in those places.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:28.880
There are people that you come into contact with, there are people that I came into contact

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.239
with when I worked in the corporate world for many years that my pastor would never

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.239
meet.

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:38.600
It just never was going to happen that my pastor would ever sit down and have lunch

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.119
with some of the colleagues that I had when I worked in the corporate world.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:47.320
And it's unlikely that I'll probably have lunch with some of your colleagues.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.600
And so God has placed you there.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.399
God had placed me in that particular setting with an opportunity to be a representative

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.519
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.600
We find that the Bible teaches us very plainly and very clearly the truth of the brevity

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.880
of life.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.519
I think that C.T.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:15.160
Studd was really capturing that idea, only one life, he says this, will soon be past.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.679
And the Bible teaches us the truth of the brevity of life.

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:25.000
And the fact that the Bible says in James that our life is like a vapor that appeareth

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.600
for a little time and then it vanisheth away, and we can consider the brevity of life and

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.320
understand those truths, and we know as believers that we've been given the responsibility to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:46.359
redeem the time and to understand that these days that God has given us to dwell here upon

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:53.880
the earth are few and we have opportunities that will soon be past.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.920
The song that we sang this evening is, You're All on the Altar, and we think about this

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.959
song and if we answer the song with the answer of, yes, my all is on the altar, then there

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:09.440
will be no question who it is that we're living for.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.480
Seems pretty obvious that if our all is on the altar, then we are living for Christ.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.279
We're not living for self, we're living for Christ.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.920
As I think about the song and I think about some of what we've dealt with even in recent

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.320
days as we've studied the book of Joshua, and we dealt with the first lesson there at

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.880
the end of the eighth chapter when they made those offerings, and we spoke about how they

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.679
offered burnt offerings and they sacrificed peace offerings upon that altar when Joshua

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:43.799
built the altar according to what was commanded by Moses there in Deuteronomy in chapter 27,

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:44.799
and we find the fulfillment.

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:50.519
And if you watched that particular Joshua lesson, you understand that I gave application

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:58.359
to how we as New Testament believers, we are to offer, give our bodies as a living sacrifice.

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:03.320
Paul mentions that in Romans chapter number 12 in verses 1 and 2, and it's a powerful

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.440
passage of scripture where Paul says, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.880
God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.019
is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:25.320
of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.720
As we think about the truth and the challenge, if you will, that Paul presents to the believers

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.640
in Rome when he says, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that ye present

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.720
your bodies a living sacrifice, Paul was not giving them a challenge to do something that

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.000
he had not already done.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.799
Yes, it was true that Paul was challenging the believers in Rome that they were to give

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:56.760
and they were to make their bodies a living sacrifice unto the Lord, but we understand

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:03.480
that Paul would give this declaration in Galatians 2, in verse number 20, where he would speak

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.200
of his own personal testimony, and he says, I am crucified with Christ.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.260
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.980
in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.540
I believe that as you study the Scriptures, as you study the New Testament, you will find

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:36.659
that the Apostle Paul is one of the greatest examples of a man who was absolutely surrendered

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.859
to the will of God.

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:42.859
There are others, no doubt, that we could look to and we could see their example of

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:48.460
how they lived for the Lord and how they served the Lord and how they were crucified

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.219
with Christ, but as you trace the steps of the Apostle Paul, beginning in Acts chapter

00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:58.299
number 9, after his conversion, of course, he's called Saul, and that passage of Scripture,

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:03.500
his name would then later be changed to Paul, and we've come to refer to him as the Apostle

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.659
Paul.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:09.299
And we find that as you study his life and you trace his steps during those missionary

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:16.500
journeys, he was a man that was absolutely surrendered to the will of God for his life.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.780
He was living for Jesus.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.659
We sing that hymn, by the way, Living for Jesus.

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:23.460
What a great hymn that is.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.780
And we think about the importance of living our lives.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.419
That song that we would sing is a powerful song, but it's a convicting song.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:36.460
See, that's one of the things that I love about singing the old hymns.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.859
When we sing those songs, we are confronted with truth.

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:46.340
We are thinking about the words, and as we sing those songs, it's not just that we're

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.299
seeking to fill up some time and space in our services.

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:53.739
No, the songs are intended to convict us.

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:59.059
In fact, there are times in which, if we'd be honest this evening, we could have an invitation

00:09:59.059 --> 00:09:59.979
after the song.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:06.139
service. I think about one of the hymns that we sang last Sunday morning, I

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:12.859
surrender all. I surrender all. Man, that's a convicting song. And when we're

00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:20.499
singing it, I wonder if we're really realizing what we're singing. I surrender

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:29.879
all. Not some, not most, but all. We know that our songbook is full of wonderful

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:35.519
songs that are thought-provoking, convicting songs. See, the Apostle Paul

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.879
had no problem declaring who he was living for. We find that he says to us

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:45.159
here in this passage of Scripture that is before us in Philippians 1 and verse

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:54.319
number 21, he says, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. I want you to

00:10:54.319 --> 00:11:01.079
capture some of the, really, the context of what the Apostle Paul is saying. Back

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:04.439
up, if you will, to the twelfth verse of chapter number one of the book of

00:11:04.439 --> 00:11:07.799
Philippians, and we could look at the first eleven verses and see the

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:12.459
greetings and the place that the people at Philippi had in the heart of the

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:17.279
Apostle Paul and his love, care, and concern for these believers at Philippi.

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:22.239
And we can rejoice in that relationship that had been established through the

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:26.199
missionary journey, the second missionary journey, when the Apostle Paul had the

00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:31.259
privilege of being able to serve in that community. We believe that the book of

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:37.199
Philippians was written somewhere between 10 and 13 years after his first

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:42.279
arrival in Philippi in that ministry. Of course, the book of Philippians is a book

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:47.599
in which we can speak about rejoicing and joy, and he tells us in the fourth

00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:51.519
chapter, a verse that is extremely familiar to many of us, in verse number

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:58.599
four, rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice. Paul's writing from

00:11:58.599 --> 00:12:05.679
prison, yet he's telling him about rejoicing. Isn't that wonderful? We find that

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:11.239
Paul begins in verse number 12 to capture the context of that great

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:14.479
statement that is made in verse number 21. Notice what he says,

00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:20.079
but I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:26.399
unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel. We could spend

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.359
the entirety of our time this evening just focusing on the truth of verse

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:34.479
number 12 and how the Apostle Paul had a proper perspective of his life. He

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:38.439
understood the sovereignty of God. He understood what we spoke about this

00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:43.399
morning, remembering that the Lord is still on his throne and God is in

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:47.919
control. And the Apostle Paul says, there's something that I understand

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:53.599
about my current circumstances, but I want you to understand it as well. I

00:12:53.599 --> 00:12:57.559
don't want you to be ignorant of these things, I want you to be aware. He said, I

00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:02.199
would ye should understand, brethren, notice what he says, that the things

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:07.479
which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the

00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:11.519
gospel. There are times in which we can look at our circumstances and we can say,

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:15.879
woe is me, look at how unfortunate these things are, and look at all of these

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:19.839
things that I'm dealing with. But the Apostle Paul said, no, these things that

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:24.799
have happened have happened for the furtherance of the gospel. And he says

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:29.719
this in verse 13, so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:35.079
and in all other places. Notice what Paul's saying. He's saying, I have

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:40.879
opportunities to share the gospel with people because of my circumstances that

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:48.519
otherwise I would not have had. That's a good perspective on life. I hope that

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:52.279
this evening, as we look at the book of Philippians and just review a few of

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:57.079
these things, that we would be challenged by the perspective of the Apostle Paul,

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:02.599
and we find that he speaks about the opportunities that the Lord would give

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:07.519
him given his current circumstances. And in the last part of the book of

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:12.519
Philippians, in chapter 4 and verse 22, he says this, all the saints salute you,

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:18.119
chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. What a blessing. There are some

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:24.159
people that got saved because Paul was in that place. Verse 14, and many of the

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:29.319
brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:35.559
word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and strife, and some

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:38.999
also of goodwill. The one preached Christ of contention, not sincerely,

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:43.359
supposing to add affliction to my bonds, but the other of love, knowing that I am

00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:49.239
set for the defense of the gospel. What then? Notwithstanding, every way, whether

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:55.119
in pretense or in truth, notice, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, yea,

00:14:55.119 --> 00:15:02.799
and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:07.679
through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:12.639
my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with

00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:19.319
that with all boldness as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:27.079
body, whether it be by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die

00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:33.039
is gain. I notice as we look at the passage of Scripture, a commitment that

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:39.079
the Apostle Paul had made. I do not believe that Philippians 121, as we've

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:44.759
quoted it often, and maybe some of God's people over the years have used this

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:49.959
verse as maybe a life verse, if you will, and certainly it's an appropriate life

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:54.959
verse. It's appropriate for us to say, for to me to live is Christ, and to die is

00:15:55.079 --> 00:16:00.599
gain, and we see the truth in this verse of Scripture with regard to the

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:05.879
life that I'm now living, that I would live this life for Christ, and that when

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:11.879
I, as Peter said in 2 Peter 1, put off this my earthly tabernacle, that I'll be

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:18.039
with Christ, that I will have that gain, and to die is gain. He goes on to mention

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:22.039
about the struggle that he was dealing with. He says in verse 23, I'm in a

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:26.159
strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:30.839
better, and so Paul was assured of his salvation. Paul was absolutely confident

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:35.159
and to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. He knew that

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:40.959
truth. He proclaimed that truth, but Paul says, for to me to live is Christ. It's

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:51.559
not a cliche. It's a commitment. Every day of my life, I want it to count for Christ.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:17:00.319
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. I believe that there are some

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:05.679
things that Paul constantly remembered in his life that led him to making such

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:09.839
a commitment. If you will, just turn over with me to a couple of passages. We'll

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.319
just look at a couple. Look in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6. We'll look

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.119
at one in 2 Corinthians, and then we'll be back to the book of Philippians, but

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:23.999
notice in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, in verses 19 and 20, again a familiar

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:27.859
passage of Scripture to us, but I believe that some of these things that Paul

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:32.959
often preached were things that he meditated upon himself and things that he

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:37.359
recalled on a regular basis. You find that as you study the life of the

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:42.279
Apostle Paul, I believe that I could say with accuracy that he never got over the

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:46.839
fact that he was saved. I don't think he ever forgot what happened on the road to

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:53.359
Damascus. You find that as he would stand before many and give his testimony that

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:58.039
he refers back to that day, and all that was taking place, and how he had been

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:02.999
saved, and what joy filled his heart and his life knowing that he belonged to

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:07.679
Jesus. In 1 Corinthians 6 and verses 19 and 20, he says to the believers in

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:13.359
Corinth, he says, what? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy

00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:19.199
Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God? And notice where he says, and ye are

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:26.879
not your own, for you're bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:33.479
and in your spirit, which are God's. See, Paul understood the price that was paid

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:39.440
for his redemption. To redeem means to buy back. We speak about the truth of

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.880
redemption throughout the Scriptures, and we find if you were to study the first

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.440
chapter of the book of Ephesians, you would look at the plan of redemption and

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.119
you would see the price for redemption, and that is the precious blood of Christ.

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:56.719
We find that Peter deals with that truth in 1 Peter chapter 1, that we're

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:01.000
not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold. No, we're redeemed

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.760
with the precious blood of Christ. We find that Ephesians goes on to deal with

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.519
the proof of our redemption, the fact that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us,

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:15.199
and we see here in this passage how that the Apostle Paul connects those

00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:20.199
things. He says that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost. He tells us two

00:19:20.199 --> 00:19:24.919
very important things. Number one, we're not our own. You go through life and you

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:31.359
hear people say, I'm my own man. I do what I want to do. I'm my own, you know,

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:38.559
whatever, and the reality is that as God's people, we're not our own. We've

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:45.839
been bought with a price, and that price is the precious blood of our Savior, God

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:53.279
in flesh, Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. If you were to read the gospel accounts

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:59.199
and read the end of each gospel account, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and read the

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.039
account of the

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:04.519
of the crucifixion,

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:06.219
you will see the price that was paid

00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:08.119
for your redemption.

00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:09.439
And I would submit to you

00:20:09.439 --> 00:20:11.679
that the Apostle Paul,

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:13.599
as he would consider this commitment

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:15.739
when he would say for me to live as Christ

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:17.299
and to die as Gain,

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:18.379
he would understand,

00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:20.599
he would have this knowledge

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:23.079
of the fact that he was not his own,

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.639
that he was bought with a price,

00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:26.059
and he concludes,

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.419
since I'm not my own,

00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:29.239
since I was bought with a price,

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:32.999
therefore, the natural conclusion

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:35.399
that we reach based upon that truth

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:38.179
is that we are to glorify God

00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:40.039
in our bodies.

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:40.879
He says this,

00:20:40.879 --> 00:20:42.519
therefore, glorify God in your body

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:46.959
and in your spirit which are God's.

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:50.079
He would say there in 1 Corinthians 10

00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:50.919
and verse 31,

00:20:50.919 --> 00:20:51.759
you don't need to turn there,

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:52.579
but he says,

00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:53.419
therefore, whether you eat or drink

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.819
or whatsoever you do,

00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:58.419
do all to the glory of God.

00:20:58.419 --> 00:21:00.299
In 2 Corinthians 5,

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.619
what led to the commitment?

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:04.539
Because I see in Philippians 1 and verse 21,

00:21:04.539 --> 00:21:06.659
I see a great declaration

00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:08.859
that the Apostle Paul would make there

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:10.299
in that passage of Scripture,

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:13.019
but I find more than just a declaration,

00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:15.299
I see a commitment daily

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:18.459
that I'm going to live for Christ.

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:19.659
I believe the truth here

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:21.259
in 2 Corinthians 5,

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:23.619
I preached on this passage of Scripture

00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:26.659
several Sunday mornings ago.

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:28.739
He reconciled.

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:30.499
And we find that in verse 14

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:31.579
of 2 Corinthians 5,

00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:32.399
the Bible says,

00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:34.379
for the love of Christ constraineth us

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:35.499
because we thus judge

00:21:35.499 --> 00:21:36.579
that if one died for all,

00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:38.019
then we're all dead.

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:39.379
And then he died for all

00:21:39.379 --> 00:21:41.259
that they which live

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:44.899
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:47.659
but unto him which died for them

00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:50.379
and rose again.

00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:52.099
Those of you that have received

00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:54.299
any sort of correspondence from me

00:21:54.299 --> 00:21:55.619
over the years,

00:21:55.619 --> 00:21:57.099
know that 2 Corinthians 5

00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:58.939
and verse 15 is a verse

00:21:58.939 --> 00:22:01.459
that I put in emails,

00:22:01.459 --> 00:22:03.339
letters, cards,

00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:05.859
whatever that I send out.

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.579
This verse of Scripture

00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:11.139
has had a profound impact upon my life.

00:22:11.139 --> 00:22:12.699
I mentioned the song that we sing,

00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:14.059
Living for Jesus,

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:15.259
and we find here

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:18.379
that in the verse of Scripture,

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:21.339
he says in that he died for all

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:23.859
that they which live

00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:28.699
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:22:28.699 --> 00:22:31.899
no, but unto him which died for them

00:22:31.899 --> 00:22:34.539
and rose again.

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:38.979
So often, I think in our culture,

00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:40.819
we've been given this mindset

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:43.219
and this perspective of

00:22:43.219 --> 00:22:46.139
what are you going to do with your life?

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:47.939
Young people hear it all of the time.

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:50.139
My children are getting older.

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:52.819
And 13, 15, and 17,

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.019
it's hard to believe,

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:56.259
Juliana had her birthday last week,

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:57.099
turned 17.

00:22:57.099 --> 00:22:58.859
She's gonna be a senior in high school.

00:22:58.859 --> 00:22:59.699
And as such,

00:22:59.699 --> 00:23:01.099
will be asked the question

00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:02.259
hundreds of times.

00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:04.339
She's already been asked the question

00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:05.339
plenty of times.

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:07.499
What are you going to do?

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:08.339
We remember,

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:10.579
those of us that were seniors in high school,

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:12.779
we remember being asked that question.

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:14.219
Even before you're a senior,

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:15.059
you get asked,

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:15.899
what are you gonna do?

00:23:15.899 --> 00:23:16.739
Where are you gonna go to college?

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:17.619
What are you gonna do with your life?

00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:19.219
So on and so forth.

00:23:19.219 --> 00:23:22.339
And I have submitted to many over the years

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:23.659
that a better question is not

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:25.059
what do I want to do with my life,

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:27.739
but what does the Lord want me to do with my life?

00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:30.099
As the people of God,

00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:32.259
as people that understand redemption,

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:35.499
as people that understand the truth of the Word of God,

00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:38.019
we ought to make this commitment that Paul made

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:41.139
for me to live as Christ and to die as Gain.

00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:43.499
And what is it that the Lord wants me to do?

00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:46.339
Again, not every person will be a missionary

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:47.859
or a pastor,

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.579
but we have to understand

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:51.659
what does God want with my life?

00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:56.459
We know through the revealed will of God

00:23:56.459 --> 00:23:58.579
that He wants us to live for Him.

00:23:58.579 --> 00:23:59.579
He wants us to live for Him.

00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:01.539
He doesn't want us to live for self.

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:03.819
He wants us to live for Christ.

00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:05.619
We find there in the book of Philippians,

00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:07.499
I mentioned that we'd get back there in just a moment.

00:24:07.499 --> 00:24:09.499
Look, we're looking at the first chapter.

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:11.019
Look at chapter number three.

00:24:12.979 --> 00:24:14.619
In chapter number three,

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.899
the Bible gives us some truth

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:20.339
with regard to the life of Paul

00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:21.779
and some of the things that he deals with.

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:23.659
And he says in verse number four,

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:25.859
though I might also have confidence in the flesh,

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:28.819
if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof,

00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:31.419
he might trust in the flesh, I more.

00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:32.699
Circumcised the eighth day,

00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:34.659
the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:37.539
and Hebrew of the Hebrews is touching the law of Pharisee.

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:39.419
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church,

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:41.139
touching the righteousness which is in the law,

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:42.619
blameless, verse seven.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:45.179
But what things were gained to me,

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:48.499
those I counted loss for Christ.

00:24:48.499 --> 00:24:51.379
Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss

00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:53.939
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,

00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:57.299
my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things

00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:59.339
and do count them but dung,

00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:01.899
that I may win Christ and be found in him,

00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:04.739
not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law,

00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:06.739
but that which is through the faith of Christ,

00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:10.739
the righteousness which is of God by faith,

00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:15.219
that I may know him and the power of his resurrection

00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:16.699
and the fellowship of his sufferings,

00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:19.219
being made conformable unto his death.

00:25:19.219 --> 00:25:22.579
If by any means I might attain

00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:23.979
unto the resurrection of the dead,

00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:25.979
not as though I had already attained,

00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:28.939
either were already perfect, but I followed after.

00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:30.459
If that, notice where he says,

00:25:30.459 --> 00:25:35.459
I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:38.459
of Christ Jesus.

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:42.339
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:43.539
but this one thing I do,

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:45.299
forgetting those things which are behind

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:48.459
and reaching forth unto those things which are before,

00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.539
I press toward the mark for the prize

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:56.539
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

00:25:56.579 --> 00:25:59.379
Paul says, for to me to live is Christ

00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:01.459
and to die is gain.

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:03.259
He made a commitment.

00:26:03.259 --> 00:26:06.819
Again, this is not some sort of cliche.

00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:08.779
It's a commitment that Paul made.

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:11.099
I believe that as the recipients

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:12.779
of this wonderful letter that we call

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:13.739
the book of Philippians,

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:15.339
that as they received and read,

00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:18.179
I believe that many within the congregation

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:19.579
of the church at Philippi,

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:21.979
they would agree with what Paul is saying.

00:26:21.979 --> 00:26:25.819
They had the privilege of seeing his life and ministry

00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:28.459
and they would understand exactly what he was meaning

00:26:28.459 --> 00:26:30.059
when he said, for to me to live is Christ

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:30.899
and to die is gain.

00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:33.539
I believe that in that phraseology

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:35.379
and in that statement,

00:26:35.379 --> 00:26:37.059
that there's not only a commitment,

00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:39.619
but there's also a level of conviction

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:41.099
upon the people that are reading

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.739
the truth that's been given.

00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:44.819
Could I say that?

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:48.259
I wonder as the believers in Philippi

00:26:48.259 --> 00:26:51.019
receive the letter and they read it for the first time,

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:54.139
I wonder if any amongst them would say,

00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:55.859
I wonder if I could say that.

00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.259
I wonder if I could say that,

00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:02.139
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:06.219
There's a level there of conviction

00:27:06.219 --> 00:27:08.739
when you read about the commitment that was made.

00:27:08.739 --> 00:27:11.339
And I wonder this evening,

00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:15.099
if any had had that thought on whether or not

00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:18.259
they too could make that comment,

00:27:18.259 --> 00:27:20.459
if they could make that declaration.

00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:22.339
I wonder this evening,

00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:23.859
if there were some that were saying,

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:25.899
I need to be in that place

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.659
where I could make the same commitment

00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:29.059
that the Apostle Paul made,

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:31.099
for to me to live is Christ.

00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:32.859
Can I tell you that you would never regret

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:34.219
living for Christ?

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:38.659
Remember the quote that we started this evening

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:39.899
from C.T. Studd,

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:42.619
only when life will soon be passed,

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:45.539
only what's done for Christ will last.

00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:48.619
It's interesting as we look at the commitment

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:50.739
of the Apostle Paul and we see what he says

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:53.419
and really the focus of our message this evening

00:27:53.419 --> 00:27:55.979
is dealing with what led to that commitment

00:27:55.979 --> 00:27:57.059
and the commitment itself.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:59.259
But I want you to notice in the book of Philippians

00:27:59.259 --> 00:28:00.619
in the second chapter,

00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:03.819
I want you to see a contrast that the Lord gives us.

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:07.619
And as we look at this contrast

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.459
in Philippians chapter number two,

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:10.859
beginning in verse number 19,

00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:14.659
I want you to see what the Apostle Paul says.

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:17.179
Now remember, he's writing from prison

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:19.819
and he tells them in verse number 19,

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:22.579
but I trust and in Philippians two in verse 19,

00:28:22.579 --> 00:28:24.659
but I trust in the Lord Jesus

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:29.139
to send Timotheus shortly unto you,

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:31.379
that I also may be of good comfort

00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:33.899
when I know your state.

00:28:33.899 --> 00:28:36.259
So we understand the Apostle Paul

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:38.899
had had communication with the believers in Philippi,

00:28:39.459 --> 00:28:40.859
they sent and communicated with him.

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:42.259
If you read the fourth chapter,

00:28:42.259 --> 00:28:45.139
you see their involvement in his ministry and what have you,

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:47.099
but you find here that the Apostle Paul

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:49.579
had an interest in knowing the state of the flock,

00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:52.699
knowing the state of the church in Philippi.

00:28:52.699 --> 00:28:55.699
He himself was not able to go and just travel

00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:57.659
and go over there to Philippi

00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:59.539
and find out how things were going.

00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:03.019
So he would send Timothy in his place.

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:05.940
It's interesting as you kind of on a side note,

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.820
as you notice often throughout the epistles

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.619
that the Apostle Paul is concerned

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:15.739
about those that God allowed him to minister to.

00:29:15.739 --> 00:29:17.739
He speaks to the believers in Thessalonica.

00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:20.579
We looked at 1 Thessalonians 2 last Sunday morning

00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:23.339
and you look in the passages there

00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:24.459
in the book of 1 Thessalonians

00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:27.019
and you see that Paul was going to send Timothy

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:29.139
to find out how they were doing.

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:31.099
He was concerned for them.

00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:32.820
He says this in 2 Corinthians,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.659
you don't need to turn there,

00:29:33.699 --> 00:29:35.579
but chapter 11 and verse 21,

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:37.380
he says beside those things that are without,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.139
that which cometh upon me daily,

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:42.619
the care of all the churches.

00:29:42.619 --> 00:29:45.179
The Apostle Paul wanted to know their state.

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:47.339
So he's going to send Timothy, verse 20,

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.859
notice what he says in Philippians 2 and verse 20,

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:51.859
for I have no man like minded

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:54.619
who will naturally care for your state.

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:57.579
And then notice this truth in verse 21,

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.179
for all seek their own.

00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:07.979
not the things which are Jesus Christ.

00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:10.319
But ye know the proof of Him

00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:11.819
that as a son with the Father,

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:14.739
He hath served me in the gospel."

00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:19.079
Verse 22 is a testimony of Timothy.

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:20.619
He's going back and speaking about

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:21.819
the testimony of Timothy.

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:24.079
That's why he's going to send Timothy to them

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:26.099
because of the testimony that he has.

00:30:26.099 --> 00:30:28.539
But I want you to notice the contrast

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:30.859
between what Paul says in Philippians 1

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:32.899
and verse 21 of himself.

00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:34.739
For to me to live is Christ

00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:36.259
and to die is gain.

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:38.859
And what he says of those in Philippians 2

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:40.299
and verse 21,

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:42.819
for all seek their own,

00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:48.099
not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:49.779
What sad commentary is given

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:53.219
in Philippians 2 and verse 21?

00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:54.979
I've asked the question this evening,

00:30:54.979 --> 00:30:57.099
who are you living for?

00:30:57.099 --> 00:30:59.619
We sang the song as our final

00:30:59.619 --> 00:31:00.739
congregational song.

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:02.899
I love it when it works this way.

00:31:02.899 --> 00:31:05.339
I didn't ask Holly to pick songs this week.

00:31:05.339 --> 00:31:06.859
I mean, I asked her to pick them,

00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:08.539
but I didn't tell her which songs to pick.

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:09.779
She just picked the songs.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:12.379
And she told me what they were.

00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:14.739
And honestly, the only thought that I had

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.659
wasn't so much with what songs they were,

00:31:16.659 --> 00:31:17.939
but the fact that we had at least

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:20.099
one patriotic song this morning.

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:21.459
And I didn't give much thought

00:31:21.459 --> 00:31:23.659
to the songs and which order they were in

00:31:23.659 --> 00:31:24.699
and all of those things.

00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:26.019
She was handling that.

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:28.419
And I appreciate her doing that.

00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:31.899
And as we turn to that last hymn this evening,

00:31:31.899 --> 00:31:34.459
I didn't realize until we got up here

00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:37.139
until we were singing our theme song,

00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:38.499
I didn't realize that the last hymn

00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:39.539
that we would sing tonight

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:42.059
is, You're All on the Altar.

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:43.299
And as we sang that song,

00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:45.419
and actually when Jared was still

00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:47.939
leading the theme song as we were singing it,

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:50.219
I was thinking how appropriate

00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:51.859
is, You're All on the Altar,

00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:53.339
and I'm preaching a message,

00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:56.299
who are you living for?

00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:58.859
And if we can sing that song

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:00.099
that we sang this evening,

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:03.619
and we can say, yes, my all is on the altar,

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:05.499
then the answer's obvious.

00:32:05.499 --> 00:32:07.179
I'm living for Christ.

00:32:07.179 --> 00:32:08.899
For me to live is Christ,

00:32:08.899 --> 00:32:10.539
and to die is gain.

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:12.139
I don't want to be categorized

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.500
as those unnamed people

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.059
in Philippians 2.21

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:19.019
that Paul concludes of them

00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:20.339
that they seek their own

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:24.259
and not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:28.500
I'd rather stand understanding

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.819
what the Lord has done for me,

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.500
understanding that I'm not my own,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.299
I've been bought with a price.

00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:37.659
And being able to stand and say

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:39.779
for me to live is Christ,

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:41.379
to die is gain.

00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:42.659
Does it mean that I'm going to be perfect

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:43.779
or you're going to be perfect?

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:45.699
Absolutely not.

00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:46.739
But it means that every day

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:49.299
we make a conscience decision

00:32:49.299 --> 00:32:52.299
that today, I want to live for Jesus.

00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:53.619
It's not about me.

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:56.500
I'm not crucified with Christ.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.299
I have followed the call

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:04.379
that was issued in Romans 12.

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:05.579
I beseech you therefore, brethren,

00:33:05.579 --> 00:33:06.459
by the mercies of God,

00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:07.539
that you present your bodies

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:09.939
a living sacrifice,

00:33:09.939 --> 00:33:11.419
holy, acceptable unto God,

00:33:11.419 --> 00:33:15.139
He says, which is your reasonable service,

00:33:15.139 --> 00:33:16.019
that I could say,

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:17.819
for to me to live is Christ,

00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:19.619
and to die is gain.

00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:21.819
Who are you living for?

00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:22.819
Father, we love You

00:33:22.819 --> 00:33:25.500
and we thank You for loving us.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:32.739
We thank You that You

00:33:32.739 --> 00:33:36.819
have a perfect plan.

00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:37.699
And in that plan,

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.059
You sent Your Son,

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.539
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:44.539
to come to this incursed world

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:46.219
to live a perfect, sinless life,

00:33:46.219 --> 00:33:48.299
to die, to be buried,

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:50.819
to rise in victory,

00:33:50.819 --> 00:33:53.139
to redeem us.

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:54.699
We know that that plan of redemption

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.339
was a plan that was determined

00:33:56.339 --> 00:33:57.739
before the foundation of the world,

00:33:57.739 --> 00:33:59.299
that Jesus is the Lamb of God

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:00.500
that was slain

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.500
before the foundation of the world.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.459
We know that as we study

00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:06.500
the book of Ephesians,

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.139
that the text of Scripture

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.139
is dealing with the how of salvation,

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.899
not the who of salvation,

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:15.939
and for that we rejoice.

00:34:15.939 --> 00:34:18.899
And God, I pray that as Your people,

00:34:18.899 --> 00:34:20.419
those of us that have been redeemed,

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:22.019
as we sing,

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:23.779
redeemed how I love to proclaim it,

00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:28.220
redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.419
Lord, that we would understand

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:31.100
that we're not our own,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.459
that we've been bought with a price,

00:34:34.459 --> 00:34:36.660
that we could say I am crucified with Christ,

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.739
that we could say with Paul,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:42.699
for to me to live is Christ,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.380
and to die is gain.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.619
Living for Jesus, Lord,

00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:48.019
that's our desire,

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:50.899
that our lives would count for Christ,

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:51.820
that You would enable us

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.500
to make an impact upon eternity,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.619
and we'll thank You for it.

00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:56.019
During this time of invitation,

00:34:56.019 --> 00:34:58.259
would You move in hearts and lives,

00:34:58.259 --> 00:34:59.779
would You alone be glorified?

00:34:59.779 --> 00:35:01.059
We'll thank You for what You'll do,

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:03.899
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
