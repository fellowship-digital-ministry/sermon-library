1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
with you this evening, Psalm 62.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,320
We'll be looking at the entirety of the psalm.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,119
This particular psalm, Psalm 62, is ascribed to David,

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,420
the sweet psalmist of Israel.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,000
And we find that as we come to the book of Psalms,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
generally speaking, 150 of them, of course,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,040
the songbook for the nation of Israel,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,319
for the Jewish people, and what a blessing it is

9
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,159
to be able to read through and study the psalms,

10
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,920
to see the transparency of the psalmist,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,879
to be encouraged and strengthened.

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,440
We find that God has informed us in his word

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,920
that his word is powerful.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
Aren't you thankful for the power of God's word?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,400
He told us that it's powerful.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,599
He told us that his word is profitable.

17
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:41,720
And we begin to think about how we need,

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,680
personally, individually, we need to be in the word.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,259
We need to allow the word to get into us,

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,720
and it will profit us.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,979
It'll be a blessing to us.

22
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,000
It'll comfort us.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It'll instruct us, and it'll correct where we're wrong,

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,720
and keep us straight, amen?

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,900
And all sorts of things are changing in our society,

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,599
but God is immutable, and his word is settled,

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,519
and we have to be people of the book.

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,080
And I trust that this evening, as we understand

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,319
that God has providentially preserved his word for us,

30
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,519
to help us, that as we look at this psalm tonight,

31
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,440
all 12 verses, I trust that God will use it

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,800
to strengthen and to encourage his people.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm gonna read the entire psalm,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
and then we'll dig in this evening.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,319
The psalmist says this,

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,720
"'Truly, my soul waiteth upon God.

37
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:37,360
"'From him cometh my salvation.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,319
"'He only is my rock and my salvation.

39
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,519
"'He is my defense.

40
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,279
"'I shall not be greatly moved.

41
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,699
"'How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?

42
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:51,440
"'Ye shall be slain, all of you,

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,480
"'as a bowing wall shall ye be,

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,120
"'and as a tottering fence.

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,779
"'They only consult to cast him down from his excellency.

46
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,220
"'They delight in lies.

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,860
"'They bless with their mouth,

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,860
"'but they curse inwardly, Selah.

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,880
"'My soul, wait thou only upon God,

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,720
"'for my expectation is from him.'"

51
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,639
Verse six and verse two, it's amazing, repeated for us.

52
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,979
Notice, "'He only is my rock and my salvation.

53
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,399
"'He is my defense.

54
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,580
"'I shall not be moved.

55
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,100
"'In God is my salvation and my glory.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,080
"'The rock of my strength and my refuge is in God.

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,559
"'Trust in him at all times, ye people.

58
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:45,559
"'Pour out your heart before him.

59
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:49,320
"'God is a refuge for us, Selah.

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,500
"'Surely men of low degree are vanity,

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,740
"'and men of high degree are a lie.

62
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,160
"'To be laid in the balance,

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,559
"'they are altogether lighter than vanity.

64
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,160
"'Trust not in oppression,

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,500
"'and become not vain in robbery.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
"'If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

67
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:10,520
"'God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this,

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,440
"'that power belongeth unto God.

69
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,940
"'Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy,

70
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,740
"'for thou renderest to every man according to his work.'"

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,300
As we look at this Psalm this evening,

72
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,100
I wanna draw your attention to the middle of verse number eight.

73
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,860
We'll use it for our title this evening.

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,059
In the midst of verse number eight,

75
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:37,059
the psalmist says, "'Pour out your heart before him.

76
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,240
"'Pour out your heart before him.'"

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,300
On more than one occasion, the psalmist did this.

78
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:45,979
On more than one occasion,

79
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,080
we find that David facing great difficulties in his life,

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,520
we find that he poured out his heart before the Lord.

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,839
As we begin to look at this Psalm,

82
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,440
I notice number one, if you're taking notes this evening,

83
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,880
the trial of the psalmist.

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,839
With many of the Psalms,

85
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,919
we find that there's times

86
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,600
in which you can specifically look at

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,360
this must have been written during this particular event.

88
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
And with some of the Psalms,

89
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,399
there's multiple different events

90
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,360
that it could be written at multiple different points.

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,899
And we find that many times in David's life,

92
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,799
he faced great trials.

93
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,040
We find that he was a faithful man.

94
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,799
He was diligent to do what God had called him to do.

95
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,820
He was diligent and faithful as a young man

96
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,640
doing what his earthly father had instructed him to do.

97
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,339
We find that David was a man that after his anointing

98
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,019
and the pages of scripture that God gives us

99
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,100
and recording for us his life,

100
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,839
we find that Saul made David his enemy continually.

101
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,459
We find that, of course,

102
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,339
the Philistines were regularly trying to attack

103
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,799
and conquer and kill.

104
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,380
And we find that even his own son Absalom

105
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,380
revolted against him.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,899
We begin to look at the trial of the psalmist

107
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,700
in this text of scripture.

108
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,459
We find that in verse number three,

109
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:08,500
notice he says,

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,820
how long we imagine mischief against a man.

111
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,619
He shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall

112
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:18,040
shall you be in as a tottering fence.

113
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,019
Notice what he says in verse number four,

114
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,700
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency.

115
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,019
They delight in lies.

116
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,619
They bless with their mouth,

117
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,380
but they curse inwardly.

118
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,260
Selah.

119
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,540
David is expressing to us and explaining to us

120
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,380
the trial in which he's facing,

121
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,579
the test, the difficulty in which he's experiencing

122
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,420
in his life.

123
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,260
And we find that as he's giving to us

124
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,899
with transparency here,

125
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,260
this trial and what he's experiencing,

126
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,459
he's speaking about these difficulties.

127
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,179
And I understand today that even as he mentions

128
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,140
in verse number nine,

129
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,459
while he's giving instruction, he says this,

130
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,459
surely men of low degree are vanity

131
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,700
and men of high degree are a lie

132
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,980
to be laid in the balance.

133
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,140
They're altogether lighter than vanity.

134
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,980
And the reality is that as David is dealing

135
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,739
with this trial in his life,

136
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,700
he's having this great burden, this great experience.

137
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,940
And he's overwhelmed because of all that's taking place.

138
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,700
He's in the midst of this trial.

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,220
But I want you to understand that in the midst of the trial,

140
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,660
it's not something that's unique to David.

141
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,500
Trials, though he was afflicted

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,339
and though he faced many trials,

143
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,359
we find this evening that trials are not something

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that were unique for David's life.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,239
You face trials, I face trials,

146
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,040
we all face trials in life.

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,640
The reality this evening is that God knows

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,000
that we'll face trials.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,799
God knows that we'll deal with these times

150
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:51,200
of testing and difficulty.

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
And he provides for us instruction.

152
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,799
And we find here in the Psalm

153
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,760
as we'll get through the message this evening,

154
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,200
a great example instruction for what it is

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,119
that we're to do.

156
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,839
But I want you to notice, consider with me this evening,

157
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,119
the truth of Hebrews chapter number 11.

158
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:07,359
We'll look at two verses in the New Testament

159
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,679
and deal with this idea of trials.

160
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,799
And we see the trial of the psalmist.

161
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,760
I do not believe this evening

162
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,559
that I need to go through great lengths

163
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,239
to convince you that you have faced trials.

164
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,839
I think that all of us would readily quickly stand up

165
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,440
and say, not only have I faced trials,

166
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,880
but I'm very much in the midst of a trial

167
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,079
at this very moment.

168
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,640
And I understand this evening that we face trials,

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,239
we face testings.

170
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:38,040
In Hebrews chapter 11, we come to verse number 36.

171
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,679
Notice what the Bible says,

172
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,720
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,

173
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,440
yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.

174
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,119
Notice they were stoned, they were sawn asunder,

175
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:55,000
were tempted, were slain with the sword.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,480
The Bible says they wandered about in sheepskins

177
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,440
and goatskins being destitute, afflicted, tormented.

178
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,679
It says of whom the world was not worthy,

179
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,880
they wandered in deserts and in mountains

180
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,760
and in dens and caves of the earth.

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,720
These trials that are mentioned at the end

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,959
of the great faith chapter in Hebrews chapter 11,

183
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,679
there are some specifically that we can look to

184
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,160
and we can piece things together

185
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,679
and begin to understand who may be spoken of

186
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,839
in these particular trials.

187
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,760
But we find that they face some serious, serious trials.

188
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,799
And then I'm reminded of the people

189
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,280
that Peter is ministering to.

190
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,000
If you look in 1 Peter,

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,760
we find that Peter is ministering to a group of people

192
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,119
that are facing great difficulty, trials.

193
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,479
In fact, as he's writing in the first chapter

194
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,880
to these individuals,

195
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,159
he's writing to those that are scattered abroad,

196
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,239
they're strangers.

197
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,919
He lists in verse number one of chapter one,

198
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,440
the region in which they're located, Pontus, Galatia,

199
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,159
And he talks about they're scattering,

201
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,679
it's a result of the persecution of Nero,

202
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,280
the wicked emperor of Rome.

203
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,000
We find that the people,

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
the recipients of the book of 1 Peter,

205
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,159
they're in need of encouragement.

206
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,559
We find that you come to verse number six and he says,

207
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,880
when you greatly rejoice,

208
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,000
though now for a season if need be,

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,520
you're in heaviness through manifold temptations.

210
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Notice what he says in verse number seven,

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,640
that the trial of your faith,

212
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,520
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,

213
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,559
though it be tried with fire,

214
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,440
might be found unto praise and honor and glory

215
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,880
at the appearing of Jesus Christ,

216
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,479
whom having not seen you love,

217
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,840
and whom though now you see him not yet believing,

218
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,599
you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,

219
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,119
receiving the end of your faith,

220
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,000
and receiving the salvation of your souls.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,479
He says there in the midst of verse six and seven,

222
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,320
he says that if need be,

223
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,159
you're in these moments of trial in this manifold.

224
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,659
He says, the trial of your faith in verse number seven.

225
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,159
And then I want you to notice what Peter says in chapter four

226
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,659
with regard to this subject of trials.

227
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,159
And we come to the fourth chapter of the book of 1 Peter,

228
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,659
and we come to verse number 12.

229
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,159
And I want you to notice that Peter says this,

230
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,659
Beloved, think it not strange

231
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,159
concerning the fiery trial which is to trial.

232
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:36,659
Which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.

233
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,159
He says, think it not strange, concerning what?

234
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,659
The fiery trial.

235
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,659
We begin to look at the end of the book in chapter five,

236
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,659
and we find that Peter will say this in verse number 10,

237
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,159
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus,

238
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,659
after that ye have suffered a while,

239
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,159
make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.

240
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,659
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.

241
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,159
Amen.

242
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,159
The trial.

243
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:16,159
I understand this evening that trials are not pleasant.

244
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,159
Trials are not pleasant.

245
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,159
We find that the psalmist back in Psalm 62, he's dealing with some trials.

246
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,159
He was a man that was familiar with trials.

247
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,159
He was a man that experienced trials in his life.

248
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:37,159
We find that as believers tonight, there will be trials in our lives.

249
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,159
There will be trials, times of testing.

250
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,159
Some trials are greater than other trials.

251
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,159
Sometimes it's a health trial, sometimes it's a finance trial.

252
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,159
It's a variety.

253
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,159
There's trials.

254
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,159
We look at this passage of Scripture and we see the trial of the psalmist,

255
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,159
and then I notice number two, the testimony of the psalmist.

256
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,159
Notice with me as we begin to look at the testimony of the psalmist

257
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,159
throughout this passage of Scripture and begin to understand how he dealt,

258
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,159
how he responded to the trial in which he was experiencing,

259
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,159
we find great instruction for us.

260
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,159
This evening we find that the testimony is the result of the trial.

261
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,159
The testimony is the result of the test in which he experienced.

262
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,159
How often can we stand up on the other side of the storm

263
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,159
and we can stand and we can give testimony of what God did and how God worked

264
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,159
and what God taught us, etc., etc.

265
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,159
But in the midst of it, sometimes it's really challenging.

266
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,159
I want you to notice the testimony.

267
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,159
Number one, the psalmist resolved to wait on God.

268
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,159
The Bible says in verse number one,

269
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,159
truly my soul waiteth upon God.

270
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,159
In verse number five he repeats,

271
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:05,159
my soul wait thou only upon God.

272
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,159
To wait upon the Lord is not always easy.

273
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:16,159
In fact, in the midst of trials, it can be one of the hardest things to do.

274
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,159
Just wait on the Lord.

275
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:25,159
Wait on God to do what only God can do.

276
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:33,159
Be still, the psalmist said, be still and know that I am God.

277
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:40,159
Waiting is not always easy, but it's often necessary.

278
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,159
It's often necessary in the Christian life to wait on God.

279
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,159
Many times in our lives we get in a hurry.

280
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,159
You know what I found? God's never in a hurry.

281
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,159
He's always on time.

282
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,159
He's always on time.

283
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,159
He works with purpose.

284
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,159
You ever meet people that are always in a hurry?

285
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,159
Hey man, don't look at your wife right now.

286
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,159
Hey man.

287
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,159
Listen, you meet people that are always in a hurry.

288
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,159
I mean, they're just kind of always running behind.

289
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,159
You know what I mean?

290
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,159
Just rush, rush, rush, rush, rush.

291
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,159
Sometimes we get in a hurry in life.

292
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,159
You ever try to hurry the process of some of the ladies baking something or cooking something?

293
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,159
You try to, I did that once with ribs.

294
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,159
Brother Armando, you like to smoke some meat.

295
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,159
Brother Ron, you like to, how does it work when you hurry the process with smoking meat?

296
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,159
Terrible.

297
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,159
Honestly, requires time.

298
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:48,159
We had somewhere to go, something to do, and I said, well, if I just cut about 20 minutes from each step of the process,

299
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,159
it'll save me about an hour and we'll be okay.

300
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,159
Because smoking ribs is a long process.

301
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:01,159
So I cut 20 minutes from the first step and wrapped them up and cut 20 minutes from that step.

302
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,159
And you know what?

303
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,159
They were tough.

304
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,159
They were.

305
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,159
They weren't real tasty.

306
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,159
Because I hurried the process.

307
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,159
Sometimes in life we get in a hurry and God just wants us to wait.

308
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,159
In Psalmist here, we find his resolve to wait on God.

309
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:33,159
Understanding in verse 1 and again in verse number 5, though he's in the midst of the trial,

310
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,159
he says in verse number 3, how long will you imagine mischief against a man?

311
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,159
We find he's in the midst of the trial, but he says that my soul waiteth upon God.

312
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:51,159
It's almost like he's having self-talk in verse number 5 and he says, my soul wait thou only upon God.

313
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,159
You ever got to talk to yourself?

314
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,159
Amen.

315
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,159
He was resolved to wait on God.

316
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,159
Sometimes we get in a hurry and we mess things up.

317
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,159
Make a mess of a situation that already is a mess.

318
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,159
Just wait on God.

319
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,159
Not only was he resolved to wait on God, but he recognized who God is.

320
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,159
He recognized what God could do.

321
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,159
We find in verse number 1, he says, truly my soul waiteth upon God,

322
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:26,159
but then notice at the end of the verse, he says, from him, from God, cometh my salvation.

323
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,159
David was a man of war.

324
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,159
Was he not?

325
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,159
I mean, David was the sweet psalmist of Israel.

326
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,159
He could play that harp like no one else, but David was a warrior.

327
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,159
Amen?

328
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,159
David didn't back down to Goliath.

329
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,159
I mean, he's like, let me go.

330
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,159
I'll go and fight this uncircumcised Philistine.

331
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,159
What are you all afraid of?

332
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,159
Is there not a cause?

333
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,159
Is that the same David?

334
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,159
Is that what you read in 1 Samuel 17?

335
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,159
Amen?

336
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,159
He's not afraid of a fight.

337
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,159
Not afraid to pick up a sword and go.

338
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,159
But he's waiting on God.

339
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,159
He's not taking matters into his own hands.

340
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:12,159
He's saying, I understand that from him, from God, cometh my salvation.

341
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:16,159
Begin to see the growth of David in his life as you study through his life.

342
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:23,159
And you find that many times that David was obviously with the situation of Nabal.

343
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,159
He's like, we're going to go and we're going to kill them all.

344
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,159
And Abigail comes and intervenes and helps that situation.

345
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,159
But he is ready to go kill them all.

346
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,159
They're all going to be killed.

347
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,159
And by the way, David could do it with his men.

348
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:36,159
It was going to be accomplished.

349
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,159
But you know, later on in his life, the Philistines rise up against him.

350
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,159
You know what David does?

351
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,159
He prays.

352
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,159
God, should I go up against him?

353
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:45,159
What's he doing?

354
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,159
He's waiting on God.

355
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,159
He's seeking counsel from God.

356
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,159
God gives him victory.

357
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:54,159
But then the Philistines, after defeat, they kind of regather.

358
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,159
They're going to come again.

359
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,159
And so what does David do?

360
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,159
Well, he doesn't presume upon God.

361
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,159
He goes and seeks God's face again.

362
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,159
God, should I go up?

363
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,159
And that's the account in which God says that you're going to wait

364
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,159
and you're going to hear a rustling in the mulberry trees.

365
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,159
God gives him direction and God gives him leadership and he's waiting.

366
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,159
And we find here that he recognized who God is.

367
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,159
He recognized what God is capable of doing.

368
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,159
He says, from him cometh my salvation.

369
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,159
Notice in verse 2 and also in verse number 6, we find this declaration.

370
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,159
He only.

371
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,159
Do you notice that?

372
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:34,159
He only is my rock and my salvation.

373
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,159
He is my defense.

374
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,159
I shall not be greatly moved.

375
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,159
Do you recognize?

376
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:53,159
Do you testify that God only is your rock, is your salvation, is your defense?

377
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,159
We find that in verse number 7 that David will make this statement,

378
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,159
In God is my salvation and my glory.

379
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:10,159
The rock of my strength and my refuge is in God.

380
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,159
What you know to be true about God will be exposed in the midst of your trials.

381
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:24,159
What you know to be true about God will be exposed in the midst of your trials.

382
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:32,159
I've watched people literally crumble and almost fall apart in the midst of a trial

383
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,159
because they knew very little about God.

384
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,159
They knew very little about what God was capable of doing

385
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,159
and who God was to them personally.

386
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,159
And I've seen others sit across a table in my midst

387
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,159
and share with me a great trial,

388
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:00,159
but yet resolve in trusting God and expecting God to do

389
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,519
what God could only do.

390
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,359
Why?

391
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,999
Because they knew much about their God.

392
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,239
They knew these things to be true about their God.

393
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,559
David had experienced this.

394
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,659
David knew who God was.

395
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,479
David knew what God was capable of doing.

396
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,679
This evening, when I begin to think about the testimony

397
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,679
of the psalmist in this chapter,

398
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,879
and we can rejoice in understanding

399
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,759
that in the midst of the trial, there's a testimony there,

400
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,239
and he's waiting on the Lord, and he's expecting God

401
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,919
to work, I notice in verse number five where he says,

402
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,679
"'For my expectation is from him.'"

403
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,959
I wonder this evening, what are we expecting God

404
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,339
to do in our lives?

405
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,619
I asked this question in the last week

406
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,159
about our prayer lives, what kind of prayer,

407
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,739
what's on our prayer list right now

408
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:50,639
that is something that only God can do?

409
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,239
I mean, a miracle, not something that we're gonna try

410
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,839
to figure out and manipulate ourselves,

411
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,579
but something that truly is going to be God's hand at work.

412
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:05,279
And he says, my expectation is from him.

413
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,359
What are you expecting God to do in your life?

414
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,879
He is able to do exceeding, abundantly above

415
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,919
all that we ask or think, is that true?

416
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,159
Ephesians chapter number three, amen.

417
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,919
He is able to do exceeding, abundantly above

418
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,119
all that we ask or think, and here the psalmist says,

419
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,039
my expectation is from him.

420
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,519
I'm expecting God to do something great.

421
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,479
I note, as we look at the remainder of the chapter

422
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,639
this evening, not only the trial and the testimony,

423
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,519
but I want you to notice number three,

424
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,259
the teaching of the psalmist.

425
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,239
I believe in verses eight through 12,

426
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,879
David begins to give a lesson to those

427
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,919
that would read this psalm.

428
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,419
I believe that as David is writing these verses,

429
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,919
that he is going with what he's experienced

430
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,679
and now seeking to instruct, to teach others.

431
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,559
We find that in verse number 80 says,

432
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,159
trust in him at all times.

433
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,999
Pause there just for a moment.

434
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,619
Does all times really mean all times?

435
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,919
Amen, right?

436
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,919
Trust in him at all times, at all times.

437
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,559
In your life, when it seems like things are falling apart,

438
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,639
in your life, when it seems like there's no way,

439
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:24,079
and there's just great confusion, trust in God.

440
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,639
Blessed is the man that puts his trust in God.

441
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,319
Who's the man that's going to trust the Lord?

442
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,479
We've been dealing with it on Wednesday nights.

443
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,359
Remember in Psalm 11, the psalmist said,

444
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,279
in the Lord put I my trust, but in Psalm chapter nine,

445
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,159
he says in verse number 10, and they that know thy name

446
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,439
will put their trust in thee.

447
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,399
Trust in him at all times.

448
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,539
Why am I going to trust him?

449
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,079
Because I know him, he's trustworthy, he's never failed.

450
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,759
And David says as he's teaching now

451
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,099
and seeking to give this instruction to those

452
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,719
that would come and read this psalm, this testimony,

453
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:03,159
he says trust in the Lord at all times.

454
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,199
There's been a time in your life

455
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,799
where you didn't trust the Lord, you trust the arm of flesh.

456
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,359
You found as the songwriter said

457
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,479
that the arm of flesh will fail you.

458
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,439
Only trust him.

459
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,319
The songwriter also said, I'm so glad,

460
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,559
I learned to trust him.

461
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:23,119
He went on to say, oh, that I'd trust him more.

462
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,319
This evening, he says, trust in him at all times ye people.

463
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,319
Notice the phrase that we've used tonight for our title,

464
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,679
pour out your heart before him.

465
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,879
Can I encourage you this evening

466
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,159
that God knows your heart anyway?

467
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,079
He knows your heart.

468
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,559
Sometimes we just need to get along with God

469
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,059
and pour our heart out to him.

470
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,919
Pour our heart out to him.

471
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,079
I understand sometimes we might feel in our flesh,

472
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,519
we may feel vulnerable, we may not wanna say things

473
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,479
to certain people and we, can I tell you

474
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,779
that God wants us to pour our heart out to him?

475
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:09,319
Can I tell you that we have a great high priest?

476
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:11,279
We have a great high priest.

477
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,759
Hebrews, notice, I'm gonna read the verses to you

478
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,159
in Hebrews, go over if you will.

479
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,719
I want you to see him tonight.

480
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:21,219
I want you to understand how wonderful our savior is.

481
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,479
In Hebrews chapter number three,

482
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,919
and we'll look in chapter number four as well.

483
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,439
I said number chapter three, sorry, chapter two.

484
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:39,399
The end of chapter two, notice,

485
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,159
verse number 17, the Bible says,

486
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,279
wherefore in all things it behooved him

487
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,839
to be made like unto his brethren,

488
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,599
that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest

489
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,039
in things pertaining to God,

490
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,199
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,

491
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:57,599
for in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted,

492
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,919
he is able to succor them that are tempted.

493
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,879
You know what that word succor means?

494
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:05,439
It means to help, it means to give aid.

495
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,159
To give aid, to give help.

496
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,199
We find that in chapter number four,

497
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,839
in verse number 14, the Bible says this,

498
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,679
seeing then that we have a great high priest

499
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,159
that is passed into the heavens,

500
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,479
Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast our profession,

501
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,399
for we have not an high priest,

502
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,039
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,

503
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,559
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

504
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,759
yet without sin.

505
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,239
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,

506
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,519
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

507
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,359
to help in time of need.

508
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:47,079
We pour our heart out before God.

509
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,919
We find that this evening,

510
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,359
the psalmist is giving this instruction in Psalm 62.

511
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,439
He's now teaching, beginning in verse number eight,

512
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:58,559
to those that would come and read and be benefited by this,

513
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,559
and he says, trust him at all times,

514
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,599
but he says, pour out your heart before him.

515
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,959
Be transparent with God.

516
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,519
He knows all about it, and he cares about you.

517
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:19,439
Casting how many of your cares?

518
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,679
All.

519
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,959
Is that what 1 Peter 5, 7 says?

520
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:28,119
Casting all your care upon him.

521
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,759
Why?

522
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,679
For he careth for you.

523
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,439
Isn't that a precious truth of God's word?

524
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,919
Psalm 55, cast thy burden upon the Lord.

525
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,279
He will sustain thee.

526
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,599
And here, the psalmist, I love the imagery.

527
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,679
We saw great imagery in verse number three,

528
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,119
when he talked about the wicked as a bowing wall

529
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,319
and as a tottering fence,

530
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,119
and you get that imagery of something

531
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,039
that's ready to fall and crumble.

532
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,079
And we find here the imagery when he says,

533
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,679
pour out your heart before him.

534
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,479
Just get along with God.

535
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,759
God cares.

536
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,119
God hears.

537
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,959
Why is it that the psalmist,

538
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,919
other than the experience that he had himself,

539
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,479
why is it that he would say,

540
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,919
trust in him at all times.

541
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,559
Pour out your heart before God.

542
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,639
Well, we find in verse number eight at the end,

543
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:23,439
he says, God is a refuge for us.

544
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,919
He's my refuge.

545
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,039
He's my refuge.

546
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,079
And then we see that word again, selah.

547
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,359
We see it throughout the Psalms.

548
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,639
We're not real good at selah.

549
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,719
Because we're in a hurry.

550
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:43,279
And selah carries with it the exact opposite

551
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,319
of being in a hurry.

552
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,999
Just slow down.

553
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,479
Just meditate.

554
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,999
Let it sink in.

555
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,159
God is my refuge.

556
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,479
God wants me to trust him.

557
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,679
He wants you to trust him at all times.

558
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,479
He wants us to pour our hearts out before him.

559
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,759
He is able to help us.

560
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,359
He is able and he will succor us

561
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,519
as we read there in Hebrews.

562
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,439
And we find that he provides us

563
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,079
with that help and that aid that we need.

564
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,519
He says in verse number nine,

565
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,239
surely men of low degree are vanity

566
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,479
and men of high degree are a lie.

567
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,479
To be laid in the balance,

568
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,719
they're altogether lighter than vanity.

569
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,319
He had experienced this.

570
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,519
We talked about his trial,

571
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,759
but we understand that now as he's teaching,

572
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,719
listen, expect that these things will happen.

573
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,959
And then he says in verse 10,

574
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,399
notice the contrast of the instruction

575
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,159
in verse number eight to trust in God,

576
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,479
to trust in him at all times.

577
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,639
But now in verse number 10,

578
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:43,000
he's gonna tell us some things not to trust in.

579
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:47,559
Trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery.

580
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,919
Notice what he says at the end of verse number 10.

581
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,959
If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

582
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,000
It's kind of interesting verse of scripture

583
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,279
because you know, it's so common for humanity

584
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,959
to see riches increase and set their hope,

585
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,839
their trust in them.

586
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,719
It's so common amongst those,

587
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,839
humanity amongst each of us as human beings

588
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,239
to have the idea or the thought

589
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,519
that money can fix anything.

590
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,559
But I'm here to tell you this evening

591
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,559
that some of the saddest situations I've ever encountered

592
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,679
are of those that have more money

593
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,239
than you could even think about what to do with it.

594
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,159
Money doesn't fix problems.

595
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,599
Sometimes it can put a Band-Aid on some things,

596
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,519
but it doesn't fix problems.

597
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,599
And by the way, the Bible tells us

598
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:45,479
that riches increase, they make wings and they fly away.

599
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:48,000
We're in Haggai this morning in Sunday school

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,199
with brother Mark and there in chapter one,

601
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,559
it talked about making wages

602
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,559
and putting in a bag with holes.

603
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,079
Talk about some imagery, amen.

604
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,279
And the reality is he says, listen,

605
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,199
if riches increase.

606
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:04,699
Set not your heart upon them.

607
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:07,079
We've already determined we're going to trust in Him,

608
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,779
in God at all times.

609
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,379
By the way, I know that as a nation we're not in this place anymore,

610
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,419
but I'm thankful that on U.S. currency, at least all that I have seen,

611
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,179
I know they've had times in which they're talking about removing it,

612
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,879
it still says, to the best of my knowledge, in God we trust.

613
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:29,379
What a great reminder that we're not to be trusting

614
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:32,739
in the very thing that so many in our country are trusting in,

615
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:37,819
the money that even says, in God we trust.

616
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:44,179
Verse 11, God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this,

617
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,299
that power belongeth unto God.

618
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,539
I just like verse number 11.

619
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,019
Listen, God only ever has to say something one time,

620
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,099
but there are many times in His word that He repeats things.

621
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:58,559
And the psalmist says, God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this,

622
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,599
that power belongeth unto God.

623
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,759
Listen, my God, your God, our God has all power.

624
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,079
He has all power.

625
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,159
He's the Lord God omnipotent.

626
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,559
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

627
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,959
Who said that?

628
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:21,719
Jesus, not David, not Paul, not John, not me, not you.

629
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:26,119
Jesus Christ, our Savior, all power is given unto me.

630
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:35,999
And then He said, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

631
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,119
Amen? Acts 1 and verse number 8.

632
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,319
We're powerless.

633
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,039
We need power.

634
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:48,799
God promised to give us power, but it's His power working through us.

635
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,919
Verse 12, also, unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy.

636
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,719
Oh, I wish we had more time this evening.

637
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:58,399
Our God is so merciful.

638
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,279
He's so merciful.

639
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:05,039
Have you experienced the God who is rich in mercy?

640
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,759
Have you experienced that His mercies are new?

641
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,239
Most mornings?

642
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,239
Every morning.

643
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,239
Amen?

644
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,519
That's what the Bible teaches us.

645
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,979
Our God is merciful.

646
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:24,119
His mercy endureth forever.

647
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,039
For thou renderest to every man according to his work.

648
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,719
This evening, we see the trial, we see the testimony, we see the teaching.

649
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:43,359
I wonder tonight, I know, because we're all human beings, we're not in heaven yet.

650
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,159
I know we have trials.

651
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:46,919
I know we do.

652
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,479
I know some of you are in the midst of trials right now.

653
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:54,919
Some of you, you just came through some trials.

654
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,359
Some of us are going to, we don't even know what they are, but there are going to be some

655
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,279
trials.

656
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:09,799
God knows, and I wonder tonight, being to look at Psalm 62, will we take the instruction

657
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,079
of the psalmist, will we just be resolved that we're going to wait on God and trust

658
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,159
Him at all times?

659
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,159
We recognize that God is the one who has all power.

660
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
That God is the one that can do all things.

661
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,719
And we'll trust Him and we'll pour out our heart before Him.

662
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,599
Just get along with God.

663
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,599
We need God's help.

664
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:38,119
We need God's help.

665
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,799
And He's designed it that way, that we need Him.

666
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,799
We need Him.

667
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,519
And that's not anything that makes us of some, it's pride that gets in the way is what

668
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,879
it is.

669
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:55,839
Pride gets in the way, but we need God.

670
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,839
The songwriter said, I need Thee every hour.

671
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,679
Isn't that what the songwriter said?

672
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:03,319
I know songs aren't inspired, but that's what the songwriter said.

673
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:07,399
And I often say when I look at that song, I need Thee every second of every minute of

674
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:08,399
every hour.

675
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,679
And so do you, because He is the vine and we are the branches.

676
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,999
Without Him, we can do nothing tonight.

677
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:19,999
We look at Psalm 62.

678
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,879
I hope you spend some time meditating upon it.

679
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,279
Pour out your heart before Him.

680
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:26,279
Let's pray.

681
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,279
God, Lord, we love you.

682
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,279
We thank you for loving us.

683
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,559
We thank you for your blessings, your provision, your protection.

684
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,839
We thank you, God, for the truth of your word.

685
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,799
I pray that you'd bless in the time of invitation.

686
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:42,959
Lord, I don't know all the trials of all the folks that are gathered here, but God, I know

687
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:47,519
that you do.

688
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,519
You know our hearts, Lord.

689
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,879
You know what's going on in our lives.

690
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:58,199
And I pray, Father, that you would have in this moment of invitation your will and way.

691
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,599
God, that decisions would be made that would please Thee.

692
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,479
Well, thank you for what you'll do for us in Christ's name.

693
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,479
We pray.

694
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:05,479
