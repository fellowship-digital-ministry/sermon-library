1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,539
and I'm gonna read just a couple of verses of Scripture

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:04,860
here in the book of Ephesians,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,800
and then we'll look at a number

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,039
of other portions of Scripture.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,340
But here in the book of Ephesians,

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,039
really starting in chapter number five in verse number 22,

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,199
but if you're not careful,

8
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,159
if you start there just dealing with the family structure,

9
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,440
you miss a great key that God gives us,

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,159
and that key is provided in verse number 18

11
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,440
of the fifth chapter of the book of Ephesians.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,280
The Bible says,

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,799
and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess,

14
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,680
but be filled with the Spirit.

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
If you're saved by the grace of God this evening,

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,200
the Holy Spirit of God dwells within you.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,720
The Bible teaches us that at the moment of salvation,

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,080
we are indwelled by the Spirit of God.

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,040
He is the earnest of our inheritance,

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,759
and what a blessing to understand the truth of God's word

21
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,919
with regard to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God.

22
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,680
The reality is that at the moment of salvation,

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,720
the Holy Spirit of God indwelled us,

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,180
and we got all of the Holy Spirit that we ever will get.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,279
The problem, however,

26
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:06,879
is that as we walk this journey called the Christian life,

27
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,800
there are times in which self gets too absorbed,

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
and we are filled with self

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,440
and not filled with the Spirit.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,319
I cannot be filled with self

31
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,400
and filled with the Spirit at the same time.

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,040
I must be emptied of self.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,680
I must be dead.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,319
I die daily.

35
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,459
I am crucified with Christ.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,300
I must die to self

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,980
and then be filled with the Spirit of God,

38
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,980
and we find here that the Apostle Paul

39
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,620
writing to the believers in Ephesus

40
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,739
before he starts dealing with, in verse 22,

41
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,059
the family structure,

42
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,180
he talks about the importance

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,139
of being filled with the Spirit.

44
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,139
In verse number 22, he begins with the wives.

45
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:50,980
Wives cannot be the wife

46
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,779
that God has given them the instruction to be

47
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,019
if they are not filled with the Spirit of God.

48
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,779
Husbands are addressed next,

49
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:01,220
and husbands cannot be the husbands

50
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,379
that God calls us to be

51
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,419
if we are not filled with the Spirit of God.

52
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,940
The Bible tells us husbands

53
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,279
that were to love our wives as Christ loved the church

54
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,059
and gave himself for it.

55
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:17,960
What love that God has given,

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,139
and then he gives the instruction

57
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,820
that husbands love their wives in like manner.

58
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,360
How convicting that is.

59
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,839
I can't do it in my own strength and my own power.

60
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,940
Neither can you.

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,580
We must be filled with the Spirit of God.

62
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,800
We come to the sixth chapter,

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,639
and you understand that the chapter divisions,

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,000
verse divisions are put there

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,600
for the ease of finding portions of scripture.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,960
You find that as you come to the sixth chapter,

67
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,279
it now begins to address children.

68
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,119
The Bible says this in verse number one.

69
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,419
One of the first verses we ever taught our children

70
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,039
to memorize, by the way,

71
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,759
children, obey your parents in the Lord,

72
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,679
for this is right.

73
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:03,240
Why is it that we had our children memorize that verse

74
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
as one of the first verses that they ever memorized?

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Because we wanted them to understand

76
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
that when they obeyed mommy and daddy,

77
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,600
they were obeying God, amen?

78
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Because God said, children, obey your parents in the Lord,

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,720
for this is right.

80
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,639
Verse two, the Bible says, honor thy father and mother,

81
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,000
which is the first commandment with promise,

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,320
that it may be well with thee,

83
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,720
and that thou mayest live long on the earth.

84
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,600
These words, honor thy mother,

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,919
obviously within the context,

86
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,800
each time we read it, it says honor thy father and mother.

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
But as we think about this Mother's Day,

88
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,839
and we think about these words, honor thy mother,

89
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:53,000
these words can be found in both the Old Testament

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,339
and the New Testament.

91
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:57,740
We find that these words were first spoken by Moses.

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,100
God had given him the instruction, of course,

93
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,559
to speak to the children of Israel.

94
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm reading through the Bible for a second time this year.

95
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,440
I finished up the book of Leviticus this morning,

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,559
and I was encouraged as I was reading the last part

97
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,639
of the book of Leviticus this morning,

98
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,079
and how often God speaks to Moses,

99
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,839
but then commands Moses, say to the children of Israel.

100
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,079
And you find that Moses was a faithful minister of the Lord.

101
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,640
Moses received the word that God gave,

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,640
and then Moses faithfully gave the word to the people

103
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,480
that he was called to lead.

104
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
He could not make them obey it,

105
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,359
he could not make them follow it,

106
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,320
but he did, he fulfilled his responsibility

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,519
in giving the message to the people

108
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,079
that he was called the minister to.

109
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,299
We find that God had given him the responsibility

110
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,559
of delivering this message of honor thy father,

111
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,920
honor thy mother.

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,079
We find that it's first given in the book of Exodus

113
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,760
during the 10 commandments in Exodus 20 in verse number 12.

114
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,519
Again, we find in the book of Deuteronomy,

115
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,600
now understanding the times of the Old Testament

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,940
and understanding the audience, if you will,

117
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,679
right after the Egyptian bondage,

118
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,559
the Exodus, as we read of in the book of Exodus,

119
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,760
obviously we understand that after that great deliverance,

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
God was moving and working and gave the 10 commandments.

121
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,480
And then there was a matter of disobedience

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,959
on the part of the children of Israel,

123
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,619
and they did not enter into the land

124
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,559
for fear of the inhabitants of the land.

125
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,279
They did not trust the Lord.

126
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,480
And so there were 40 years of wanderings,

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,600
and we find that after that generation died

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,959
that would not be permitted to enter in,

129
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,000
that now Moses is called to instruct the group of people

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,239
that would enter into the land.

131
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,200
And as you read the book of Deuteronomy,

132
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,839
you find that it's in that book

133
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,119
that now Moses is addressing this group of people

134
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,540
that would actually enter into the land of promise.

135
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,679
They would inherit that land, inhabit that land.

136
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,440
And we find that in Deuteronomy 5 in verse number 16,

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,600
this same truth is given once again.

138
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,359
So we find in Exodus 20, we find again in Deuteronomy 5,

139
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,399
and then we find in the gospel records,

140
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,359
if you were to read through the gospels,

141
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:18,000
that Jesus Christ himself, God in flesh,

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
he speaks these words, honor thy father and thy mother.

143
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,959
Now we find in the text that we're looking at this evening

144
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,600
in the book of Ephesians,

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,739
the apostle Paul writing to this church,

146
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:34,000
this church in Ephesus, this important instruction.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,720
See, we sang tonight, oh Lord, send a revival

148
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,000
and let it begin in me.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is that what the song said?

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,239
That's what the songwriter said.

151
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,559
And we find that there's definitely biblical truth to that

152
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,279
with regard to the individual.

153
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,440
And see, if our land,

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
if our church is ever gonna have revival,

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,320
it begins with individuals having revival.

156
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,720
And then we find that there's revival in the home.

157
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,019
And what a blessing to think about

158
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,160
this portion of scripture.

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,200
We're not studying through all of it,

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,040
beginning in chapter five, verse 18,

161
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,000
through chapter six, verse number three,

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
but we find that there's the possibility

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,399
to have revival in our homes.

164
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,880
We started last week in our new Sunday school class,

165
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,920
that marriage class that we started last week,

166
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
and we'd invite you to come.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
We'll have our next week, our second lesson.

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,040
And we have the opportunity to examine the scriptures

169
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,160
and understand what God designed for the marriage.

170
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,959
And what a blessing to understand

171
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,279
that not only did God institute marriage,

172
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,399
but he gave instruction for marriage.

173
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,920
And I said this last week, that marriage is a journey.

174
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,679
It is a journey that is to be enjoyed, not simply endured.

175
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,760
Unfortunately, there are a lot of people today

176
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,320
that we know that you work with,

177
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,359
that maybe your family, you have family members,

178
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:56,000
you have friends that are enduring marriage,

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
not enjoying marriage.

180
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,119
We find this evening that there's the possibility

181
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,920
for revival in our home.

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,279
It requires that each individual be filled

183
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,799
with the spirit of God and follow the instruction

184
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,559
that God gives.

185
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,959
As we zero in this evening on this thought

186
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,320
of honor thy mother, I have just a few thoughts for you.

187
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,799
And really, I want the young people

188
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,640
to really pay attention this evening.

189
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,239
And obviously, the truth of God's word

190
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,200
is applicable for all of us.

191
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
But I especially want the young people

192
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,959
to be extremely attentive this evening.

193
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,000
And I hope it'll be a blessing and encouragement to you.

194
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,679
Number one, if you're taking notes,

195
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,760
it's a principle to obey.

196
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,640
We find that the Bible says honor thy father and mother.

197
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
And of course, with it being Mother's Day,

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,200
focusing on that particular aspect of honor thy mother.

199
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,520
We can read those words and we can understand

200
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,280
that the principle is a simple principle,

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,619
honor thy mother.

202
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,599
But if we're really serious about it,

203
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,280
we can say, okay, how do I do that?

204
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,599
I want to do that, but how?

205
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,039
Practically, how can I honor my mother?

206
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,320
Well, I'm glad that you've asked.

207
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,000
Turn to the book of Proverbs.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,119
And I want to give you two practical tips.

209
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:10,479
Of course, we could give much more information this evening,

210
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,119
but I want to give you two practical tips

211
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,559
from the book of Proverbs.

212
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,979
Proverbs chapter number one,

213
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,719
I've taken a few verses of scripture

214
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:19,159
and just really boiled them down

215
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,200
into two thoughts this evening

216
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,919
with regard to these practical tips.

217
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,260
Proverbs chapter number one,

218
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,219
how can I obey this principle?

219
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,780
There's a principle that is given,

220
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,679
instruction, honor thy mother.

221
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,619
How can I obey that, practically speaking?

222
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:39,299
And if you want to take and consider these two thoughts,

223
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,580
the first one would be this, forsake not her instruction.

224
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,320
Forsake not her instruction.

225
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,059
You know, I'm thankful for the instruction

226
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,619
that mothers give.

227
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,380
I'll say this as I mentioned it this morning,

228
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,820
that not every statement that I'll make this evening,

229
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,299
just like not every statement that I made this morning

230
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,500
would be applicable to every circumstance or situation.

231
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,159
Obviously, there are some people that have mothers that are lost, and they do not follow

232
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,000
the precepts or the instruction of God's Word, and so on and so forth.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,460
And so we understand that, but I'm speaking from a context of a biblical perspective.

234
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:23,159
And if you look in Proverbs 1 and verse number 8, notice what the Bible says, My son, hear

235
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,840
the instruction of thy father.

236
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,959
But then it says this, and forsake not the law of thy mother.

237
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,040
Many times, if you were to think of Old Testament times with regard to life and family life

238
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,720
as we study through the scriptures, and in fact, for many centuries of human civilization,

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
it was the case.

240
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,680
Obviously, we live in a different era today, but it was a typical situation where the husbands

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,840
and fathers would be out working while the mothers would be caring for the children in

242
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,279
the homestead, if you will, and providing that instruction and giving at the, at her

243
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,160
knees, even we mentioned that this morning, the instruction to her children.

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,540
We see here that the scriptures say, forsake not the law of thy mother.

245
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,879
Over in chapter 6, notice what the Bible says in Proverbs 6 and verse number 20, again,

246
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,019
it's the same command.

247
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,480
It's interesting that we read of this same thing in chapter 1, and we read it again in

248
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
chapter 6.

249
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Do you think that the wise man, that God, ultimately as the author of this wonderful

250
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,779
book of Proverbs, he wants us to understand this truth?

251
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,860
It says, My son, keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother.

252
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,779
It goes on in verse 29, 21, and says, bind them continually upon thine heart and tie

253
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,139
them about thy neck.

254
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,419
When thou goest, it shall lead thee, when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee, and when

255
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:00,260
thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

256
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,660
For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are

257
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,979
the way of life, to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of

258
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,820
a strange woman.

259
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,660
There are many that have given testimony with regard to how the prayers of their mother,

260
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,779
the instruction of their mother, how it influenced them, and even in various circumstances in

261
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,899
which they found themselves, it was as if they could hear their mother speaking the

262
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,619
words of instruction to them.

263
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:33,619
And it says here in the text of scripture, to forsake not.

264
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,059
How do I forsake not that instruction?

265
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,380
Well, it says in verse 21, to bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck.

266
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,899
And we think about the imagery that is provided to us in verse 21, and no doubt when still

267
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,460
even today, there are some that would have understood during the time of the Lord Jesus

268
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,500
Christ that they would actually put scripture verses on their being, on their person, and

269
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,779
yet they would not even understand because Jesus would point to them and say, understand

270
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,059
us now, go find out what this means.

271
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:11,940
We find this evening that there's great imagery here, but the reality is that we must know

272
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,020
and receive that instruction.

273
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,779
Forsake not the instruction.

274
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,500
It's a great way to honor thy mother.

275
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,820
Think of this in the book of Proverbs, again, a number of verses of scripture, but the second

276
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,679
thought, a principle to obey with regard to practical tips on how to honor our mothers

277
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,979
would be to walk in wisdom.

278
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,220
The book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom.

279
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,979
In Proverbs 10, I want you to look at a number of verses here, three different verses we'll

280
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:46,220
look at with regard to this truth of walking in wisdom.

281
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,699
The Bible says this in Proverbs 10 and verse number 1, the Proverbs of Solomon.

282
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:57,179
Notice a wise son maketh a glad father, but then notice what the Bible says, a foolish

283
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,740
son is the heaviness of his mother.

284
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,860
We know we honor our mother by walking in wisdom.

285
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,940
It's a heaviness, the Bible says, a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

286
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,739
In chapter 15 and verse number 20, the Bible says this with regard to this truth of walking

287
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:26,019
in wisdom, a wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish man, notice what it says, despiseth

288
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:28,179
his mother, a foolish son.

289
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:29,519
What does he do?

290
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,160
He despiseth his mother.

291
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,519
In chapter 23 of the book of Proverbs, we'll look at a few verses there.

292
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,839
We find that here in this text, the Bible tells us in verse number 23, Proverbs 23 and

293
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,359
verse 23, by the truth, sell it not, also wisdom and instruction and understanding.

294
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:58,720
The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice, and he that begetteth a wise child

295
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,160
shall have joy of him.

296
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,559
Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bear thee shall rejoice.

297
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,160
You know, a mother rejoices as their children walk in wisdom.

298
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:23,559
A way in which a child can honor their mother is to walk in wisdom, to not forsake the instruction,

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,600
to walk in wisdom, to apply the principles in their lives, to honor their mother.

300
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,880
We see that there's a principle to obey, but there's also a promise to receive.

301
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,760
If you note the truth back in Ephesians chapter 6 and verse number 2, the Bible tells us to

302
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,000
honor thy father and mother, but then there's that parenthetical statement where the Bible

303
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,239
says which is the first commandment with promise.

304
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:55,839
If you were to go back to Exodus 20 and again to Deuteronomy 5, you'll find exactly what

305
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,220
the Apostle Paul says here in verse number 3 with regard to the promise to receive.

306
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,440
When we honor our father and mother, when we honor our parents, notice this promise

307
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,799
that is given, a two-fold promise that says, number one, in verse number 3, that it may

308
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,559
be well with thee.

309
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:20,160
Then it says this, and that thou mayest live long on the earth.

310
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,119
The first commandment with promise, in Exodus chapter 20 and verse number 12, when Moses

311
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:31,640
gives the first reference of this command, this instruction, it says that thy days may

312
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,359
be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

313
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:41,600
In Deuteronomy 5 it says that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with

314
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,279
thee.

315
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:50,220
You know, the reality is that God, as we as children, as you look here at this, children

316
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,799
obey your parents and the Lord for this is right, honor thy father and mother, which

317
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,720
is the first commandment with promise, that as children obey and honor their parents,

318
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,279
they're obeying and honoring the Lord, and the Lord blesses that.

319
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:10,420
The Lord blesses obedience, it's a principle that we find throughout the whole of Scripture.

320
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,619
As we walk in obedience, God blesses.

321
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,079
And he says that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth.

322
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,799
What great promises.

323
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,399
You think about the way that God references this, the first commandment with promise,

324
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:31,440
the promise that is directly attached to the commandment.

325
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,519
What we do with the commandment depends on, or what we do with the commandment dictates

326
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,480
the promise that is received.

327
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,880
And so we find that here, even in Ephesians chapter number six, Paul reiterates this biblical

328
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,839
truth from the Old Testament.

329
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:52,720
As we think about the simple thoughts of these verses of Scripture, it's important this evening

330
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,640
that we not simply deal with a principle and a promise, but number three this evening,

331
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,720
and finally, I want you to see that there's a warning to heed.

332
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
A warning to heed.

333
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,519
Turn to the book of Proverbs, if you will, in the 30th chapter, and I want you to see

334
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,279
what the Bible tells us.

335
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:19,859
In Proverbs chapter 30, verses 11 through 14, God says there is a generation.

336
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,720
Each verse starts that way.

337
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,519
And I want you to see what God tells us.

338
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,440
We're going to read the entirety, all four of those verses, and then focus in on verse

339
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,159
number 11 with regard to our subject this evening.

340
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,119
In verse number 11, the Bible says there's a generation that curseth their father and

341
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,280
doth not bless their mother.

342
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,400
There's a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their

343
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
filthiness.

344
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,559
There is a generation, oh, how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up.

345
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:57,799
There is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the

346
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,799
poor from off the earth and the needy from among men.

347
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,799
As we look at verse number 11, the Bible says there's a generation that curseth their father

348
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,359
and doth not bless their mother.

349
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,400
No doubt throughout human history there have been many a people, individuals, that have

350
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,200
been guilty of cursing their father and not blessing their mother, of disobeying the command

351
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,799
that's been given with promise to honor thy father and mother.

352
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,080
There's been a number of folks.

353
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,159
We can read even in the Old Testament in the Pentateuch of those that disobeyed and

354
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,719
they suffered greatly for it.

355
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:40,239
I mean, they were put to death for their disobedience.

356
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:44,760
We find as we look at the generation in which we're living and the society in which we're

357
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:53,280
living, it seems to be more and more commonplace for children to disobey, for children to curse

358
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,219
their father and refuse to bless or to honor their mother.

359
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,580
You see it all around us.

360
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,820
I made this statement last Sunday morning in our Sunday school class.

361
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,300
You see all of these things that are going on on campuses around the United States of

362
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,420
America, which is absolutely just ridiculous what's going on in our college campuses today.

363
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,340
But all of those 20-something-year-olds that are up there doing all that they're doing,

364
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,780
you know what, they were the four-year-olds that were standing in Walmart stomping their

365
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,580
feet, throwing a fit, and getting their way.

366
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,340
Now they're 20-something-year-olds and they think that that's still how they're to behave.

367
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,740
No one's told them otherwise.

368
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
No one's holding them accountable.

369
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,060
It's a problem.

370
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,940
We find that we live in a time in which people, unfortunately, and obviously, again, it's

371
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
not everyone.

372
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm thankful that there are those that are honoring their fathers and their mothers that

373
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,740
are living in obedience.

374
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,660
But we find that there is a generation, listen, I understand what it is.

375
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,500
There comes a time in the life, and I think it's more prominent with boys and young men,

376
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,020
we get to that place of being 16 or 17 years old and we think we just know everything.

377
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,140
We got it all figured out and we're smarter than our parents and so on and so forth.

378
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,220
And when we're 15, 16, 17 years old, we think mom and dad don't know anything about what

379
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,340
they're talking about and what have you.

380
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,740
And then when we're in our 20s, we kind of have that idea, well, maybe mom and dad weren't

381
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,380
as dumb as I thought they were.

382
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,060
And then when we're 30 or 40, we're like, you know what?

383
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,420
Mom and dad had a lot of wisdom.

384
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,380
They really knew what they were talking about.

385
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,340
Did any of you go through that cycle when you were 15, 16, 17?

386
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,940
Ron's like, no way, I never went through that, yeah.

387
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,380
Amen, right?

388
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,620
And listen, it's something we go through, and I'm not sure what's wrong with us, but

389
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,720
it happens.

390
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,060
But there's a warning that God gives us.

391
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:57,700
Notice in chapter 20 of the book of Proverbs, those that would refuse to honor father and

392
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
mother.

393
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,700
Remember, it's the promise, the first commandment with promise.

394
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,820
It's the promise of thy days being long, that it may be well with thee.

395
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,740
We find in Proverbs chapter 20, notice what the Bible says in verse number 20, whoso curseth

396
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,580
his father or his mother, notice what the Bible says, his lamp shall be put out in obscure

397
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
darkness.

398
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,980
That's a scary verse.

399
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,860
Amen?

400
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,540
Whoso curseth his father or his mother.

401
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,360
What is the principle tonight from Ephesians 6 that we find first in Exodus that is repeated

402
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,500
by Jesus?

403
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,740
We find that it's honor thy father and thy mother, but we find that here the Bible says

404
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,020
there's a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother.

405
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:58,020
And it says of the one whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in

406
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,100
obscure darkness.

407
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,940
Notice chapter 30, I know we kind of bounce back and forth, but go back to chapter 30

408
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,900
just after we read of those statements of the generations.

409
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:15,260
I want you to look at verse number 17.

410
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,780
Proverbs 30 and verse number 17, the Bible says, the eye that mocketh at his father and

411
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:28,240
despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young

412
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,140
eagles shall eat it.

413
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,180
That's pretty serious imagery, is it not?

414
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,980
I mean, it's pretty straight to the point.

415
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,460
There's a man by the name of Jerry Ross, he wrote some books and ministered amongst

416
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,680
teenagers for quite some time, and it said, I heard the story firsthand, I was not there

417
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:52,060
to see it happen, but I'm told that Jerry Ross was preaching at a teen camp type of

418
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,700
a summer camp setting, and he was preaching, he was preaching from this passage of scripture

419
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,260
in Proverbs chapter 30.

420
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,180
And he'd just finished up preaching and he ended with verse number 17 about the eye that

421
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,500
mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall

422
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,100
pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it.

423
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,460
And the story, as it was conveyed to me, after he'd completed the message and after they

424
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,620
had a time of invitation, they dispersed to go and do various activities that they were

425
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,020
going to do, and just within a few moments they heard some screeching cries and hollers

426
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,900
from up the road, and one of the young people that sat in that auditorium and listened to

427
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:38,140
that message that was despising and cursing their parents literally was attacked by birds

428
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,340
just moments after preaching this message, and the birds were attacking and plucking

429
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
at the face.

430
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,660
And it was told to me personally that that took place, now that's, I think about the

431
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:55,340
other couple hundred teenagers that were there, man, I'd get right in line, amen, I mean seriously.

432
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:01,140
But the reality is that when we read the warnings that God gives in His Word, it shouldn't

433
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,380
be that we have to experience something, that we have to see someone else experience something,

434
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,340
it should be that we simply accept what God has said as being truth and saying, look,

435
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,260
I don't want to be in that position, I don't want to have my candle be put out in obscure

436
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:25,540
darkness, no, I'd rather that this commandment that was given, which is the first with promise,

437
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,780
that I would honor my father and my mother.

438
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,980
How do we do it practically?

439
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,860
We must not forsake the instruction, we must walk in wisdom.

440
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,600
This evening I'm thankful, my mom, of course she's watching this evening online, they don't

441
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,020
have evening service there and she's watching, and my mom wasn't saved when I was real little,

442
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,100
she saved me when I was a teenager, but I'm thankful for the opportunity in those teenage

443
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,500
years and even still today to know that she prays for and she wants to give that godly

444
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,260
advice and counsel.

445
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:06,660
I think about Holly and obviously the opportunity that she's had as my wife and mother of our

446
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,820
children to be able to teach our children biblical instruction and provide them with

447
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
truth.

448
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,760
And listen, sometimes children, if you're not careful, you think you know more than

449
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,100
you really do, you think you're wiser than you really are, and God says honor, honor

450
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,420
thy mother.

451
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:32,220
Don't have those consequences that we see here with the warning that is given, no, determine

452
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,880
I'm going to obey.

453
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm thankful that God has given us this instruction as we think about revival this evening and

454
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,900
revival in our homes.

455
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,260
It's not just mom and dad that need to be walking in the Spirit and filled with the

456
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,220
Spirit of God, it's the children too, children that need to be filled with the Spirit of

457
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,100
God and walking in wisdom, walking in the light.

458
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:05,380
So often today we have where families are turned upside down, what do I mean by that?

459
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,620
Well the children are running the show, you see it, you see it all the time.

460
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,900
Where the parents aren't really the parents, it's the children that are calling all the

461
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,740
shots, the children are manipulative through their actions and their behavior and what

462
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,220
they do and they stomp their feet and they say what they say and they're going to throw

463
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,740
their fit until they're, well if you don't stop I'm going to do this, how many times

464
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,380
you hear somebody say that and they never follow through?

465
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,660
Maybe it ought not be that children are running the show, mom and dad are the responsible

466
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,340
parties in order to raise and to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition

467
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,300
of the Lord, but children do have a great responsibility.

468
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,900
This evening maybe you need to thank God for your mom, maybe you need to tell her how thankful

469
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,380
you are for her, maybe there's some areas in your life where you've not honored your

470
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,140
mom, maybe some of the young people, I know we don't have a lot of young people here this

471
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,060
evening but maybe there's some that God would be just speaking to you tonight and saying

472
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,140
hey, how are you doing with this area?

473
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,660
Take heed to the principle that God gives, take heed to the warning that God has provided,

474
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,060
honor thy mother.

475
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Let's pray together.

476
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,340
Father we love you, we thank you for loving us, thank you for your word, we thank you

477
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:20,140
for the opportunity to be here this evening and for the opportunity to sing wonderful

478
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,260
songs, hymns, to be challenged and comforted and Lord we thank you for your word and we

479
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,660
thank you for this commandment with promise, the first commandment with promise and God

480
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,980
I pray that you'd help, especially our young people this evening, Lord they would honor

481
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,980
their parents, they would walk in wisdom and obedience Lord that they would obey, Lord

482
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,940
that they would be used of thee, I pray that you'd help parents to fulfill their God-given

483
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
responsibility.

484
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,820
Lord I pray that we'd have homes that are honoring to thee, Lord that we'd see revival

485
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,540
in our homes that would lead to revival in our church, that would lead to revival in

486
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,059
our nation.

487
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:09,059
I pray that you'd move and work, God if there's one that's been disobedient, disrespectful,

488
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,500
not following the principles that you've given forth in your word, I pray tonight that they

489
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,299
would take heed to the warning.

490
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,420
I pray God that you'd work in their heart and draw them back to yourself, help them

491
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,619
Lord to correct their behavior, to be aligned with the principles of your word.

492
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:29,580
Well thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
