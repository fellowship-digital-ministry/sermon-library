1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
25 or 30 minutes tonight.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,159
We got time for a quiz and birthday fellowship

3
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,079
and all of that.

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,679
And Genesis 47.

5
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,500
Last week, we started looking at Genesis 47.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,079
We mentioned it'd be a two-part series.

7
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,479
This evening, we'll be looking at verses 13 through 26.

8
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:15,319
But let me just remind you quickly

9
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,200
as to what we addressed last week

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,879
as we looked at verses one through 12

11
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,040
and then verse 28 through 31.

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,200
And we titled the message last Sunday evening,

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,399
Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years.

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,200
And we learned some very important things

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,200
as we look at how God provided for his people in Egypt.

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,680
Remember in Genesis chapter 46,

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,919
God had given promises to Jacob

18
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,439
before he left with regard for the journey.

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,040
And God had given him protection

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,639
a while they were journeying.

21
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,279
And then they arrive in Egypt

22
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,799
and we find that God gave them a place.

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,319
And the Bible tells us in Genesis 47

24
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,959
that it wasn't just any place that God gave to his people.

25
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,119
We find that he moved in the heart of Pharaoh

26
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,759
and by the way, reference the morning message,

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,080
God moved in the heart of Pharaoh.

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,760
And Pharaoh said to Joseph,

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,599
give them of the best of the land.

30
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,120
And God gave them the best.

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,680
He didn't just give them a place,

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,319
he gave them the best place.

33
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,680
And we said last week that part of the understanding

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
that we have is that Jacob was in God's will

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,800
and we're in God's will.

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,199
God takes good care of us.

37
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,480
God provides for us.

38
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,440
And we see that God gave them a place,

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,519
not only a place, but provision.

40
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,360
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 12

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,680
that Joseph nourished his father, his brethren

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
and all his father's household

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,279
with bread according to their families.

44
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:40,319
We understand the picture of forgiveness.

45
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,800
He didn't just nourish his father,

46
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,000
he nourished his father and his brethren

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,480
and their families and how God provided.

48
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,760
Joseph had made the promise to his family

49
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,440
when he sent his brothers back.

50
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,319
He said, return and I will nourish you.

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
And we find that Joseph fulfilled

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,160
what he had committed to do.

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,440
And then of course, we ended the message last week

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,160
by speaking about Jacob and how he had the opportunity

55
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,679
really to reflect on his pilgrimage

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,399
and how each of us at times in our lives,

57
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,759
we need to examine our lives,

58
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,919
see where we've been, where we're going.

59
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,440
And if God would give us more days,

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
weeks and months and years ahead

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,679
that we would serve him faithfully.

62
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,919
As we come to the text of scripture this evening,

63
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,240
it's very interesting as you look at Genesis 47

64
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,080
because part of it, and it's not really half and half,

65
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,399
but a portion of it deals with the children of Israel

66
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,679
in Egypt, but then the section that we're gonna look at

67
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,039
this evening in verses 13 through 26

68
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,479
really focuses in on the Egyptians

69
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,000
and life in Egypt during this great famine.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,940
And again, we find that God's already provided to us

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,639
as we studied last week, how God gave his people a place

72
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,600
and he gave them provision,

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,679
but notice the Bible tells us in verse 13,

74
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:01,360
and there was no bread in all the land.

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,279
That's the title for the message this evening,

76
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,720
no bread in all the land.

77
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,000
As we begin to understand what's taking place,

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
we find that God is at work and God is fulfilling

79
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,160
the promises that he had given to Joseph.

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,679
And again, God had been working for years

81
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,440
with regard to preparing all of these things.

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,919
And we find that as I referenced last week

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,679
in Psalm 37 and 25, you don't need to turn there,

84
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:28,240
but David says, I have been young and now I'm old,

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,160
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken

86
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,639
nor his seed begging bread.

87
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,919
And I'm thankful for how God took care of his people,

88
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,119
even in the midst of great difficulty.

89
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,880
By the way, our God can take care of us, amen.

90
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Our God is the great shepherd

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,679
and the shepherd provides for the sheep.

92
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:54,399
And I'm so thankful that our God is able

93
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,559
and as we trust him,

94
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,320
but as we look at this portion of scripture,

95
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,600
we remember that God had revealed to Joseph

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,479
through Pharaoh's dream

97
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,399
that there would be seven years of famine.

98
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,639
I want you to hold your place here in Genesis 47

99
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,399
and just for a moment, turn back to chapter 41

100
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:14,679
and I want you to see how God back then in chapter 41

101
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:18,239
described this period of famine.

102
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,119
Notice with me in Genesis 41

103
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,359
as Joseph is interpreting Pharaoh's dream,

104
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,839
notice what the Bible says in verse number 30.

105
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,720
In Genesis 41 in verse 30,

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,079
the Bible says, and there shall arise after them,

107
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,720
after the seven years of great plenty, seven years of famine.

108
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Notice it says, and all the plenty shall be what?

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,279
Shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt.

110
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,880
Those years of great plenty,

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,720
this seven years of great famine, this dearth,

112
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
it was going to be so bad

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
that the years of plenty were going to be forgotten.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,679
It says this, and the famine,

115
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,079
notice the end of verse 30,

116
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,000
shall consume the land.

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,559
It says in verse number 31,

118
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,640
and the plenty shall not be known in the land

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,920
by reason of the famine, that famine following.

120
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,880
Notice for it, the great famine shall be very grievous.

121
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,880
We find that God of course gave Joseph a plan.

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
He explains that to Pharaoh in the next several verses,

123
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,600
and he has set a second in command of all of Egypt

124
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,320
in order to provide and to plan for the future

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,679
during those seven years of great plenty

126
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,839
so that the land would not be

127
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,359
totally desolated from population.

128
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,519
But as we get a look at this passage of scripture,

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,480
I want you to notice if you're taking notes tonight

130
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,760
from verse number 13, number one,

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,799
the devastation in Egypt, the devastation in Egypt.

132
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,399
We find that in the midst of this great famine

133
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,679
that we see how this is described for us in verse number 13.

134
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,480
I mean, it is utter devastation that we see.

135
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,600
It says this, there's no bread in the land,

136
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,519
no bread in all the land, but notice it says this,

137
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,279
for the famine was very sore.

138
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,760
So the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan

139
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,440
fainted by reason of the famine.

140
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,239
I want you to understand that as we look

141
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,600
at this portion of scripture

142
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,119
and we see what's taking place here and what's recorded,

143
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,679
this is not an embellished account

144
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,519
for the purpose of writing.

145
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,600
This is literally what was taking place in Egypt.

146
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,119
This was the effect of this great famine.

147
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:24,160
After seven years of great plenty,

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
we find that Joseph had mentioned previously

149
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
that they were only two years into the famine.

150
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,640
There were still five years left.

151
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,279
And the Bible tells us that there was no bread

152
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,119
in all the land of Egypt.

153
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,239
It says that the famine was very sore.

154
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:43,440
It says that the people fainted because of the famine.

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
Now understand this evening,

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,880
I know we've said at different times,

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,040
children are great at saying, I'm starving, right?

158
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,720
And they have this idea

159
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,359
that they're going to just die of hunger.

160
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,320
Well, here, these people literally,

161
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,119
I mean, it was a terrible, terrible time.

162
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,880
We find that the Bible tells us

163
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,119
that this famine had a far-reaching impact.

164
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:09,200
Back in chapter 41, the Bible described

165
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,040
that even at the very start of the famine,

166
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,679
those beginning years,

167
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:20,679
the Bible tells us that it was over all the face of the earth

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,399
and it tells us that all countries came into Egypt

169
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,839
to Joseph for to buy corn.

170
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,959
This is a terrible time.

171
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,160
I mean, the devastation that's in Egypt,

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,679
but I'm thankful that even in this period of devastation

173
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:36,959
that God had given Joseph wisdom and direction

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,519
and provided a plan.

175
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,920
And during those seven years of great plenty,

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,600
Joseph was preparing.

177
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,119
Joseph was preparing.

178
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,640
In fact, we find that as he's preparing,

179
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,399
it was a very simple plan that he outlined in chapter 41.

180
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,359
He tells Pharaoh that during the time of plenty,

181
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:59,320
that what they're to do in verse number 35 of chapter 41,

182
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,239
he says, let them gather all the food

183
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,040
of those good years that come

184
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,200
and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,480
and let them keep food in the cities.

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,160
And that food shall be for store to the land

187
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
against the seven years of famine,

188
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,359
which shall be in the land of Egypt

189
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,480
that the land perish not through the famine.

190
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,440
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
and the eyes of all his servants.

192
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,119
And the Bible tells us in verse 46,

193
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,959
Joseph was 30 years old

194
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,119
when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

195
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,000
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,480
and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

197
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,519
And what did he do?

198
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,039
Well, in those seven plenteous years,

199
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,000
the earth brought forth by handfuls.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
I mean, in abundance, it was great plenty.

201
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,039
And the Bible says in verse 48,

202
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,479
that he gathered up all the food of the seven years,

203
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,760
which were in the land of Egypt

204
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
and laid up the food in the cities,

205
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,599
the food of the field, which was round about every city,

206
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,159
laid he up in the same.

207
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,039
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea,

208
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,039
very much until he left numbering for it was without number.

209
00:08:57,239 --> 00:09:00,280
By the way, I'm thankful for Joseph.

210
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,359
Being in a place that was foreign to him,

211
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,640
being in a place that the circumstances

212
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,960
surrounding his arrival are less than desirous

213
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,640
and all that he experienced

214
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,799
and how easy it would be to say,

215
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,719
no, I'm not gonna do it and have a pity party

216
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:19,719
and woe is me and life isn't fair.

217
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,599
But Joseph said to his brothers,

218
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,840
God sent me before you to preserve life.

219
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,080
He had a view of God that was biblical,

220
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,919
view of God that we as 21st century Christians

221
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,239
need to have our God is sovereign,

222
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,679
our God is able, our God is in control.

223
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,559
And we find this evening that Joseph was faithful.

224
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,640
We see from verse number 13, the devastation in Egypt,

225
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,280
but we notice this catastrophic event

226
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,799
and all that's taking place,

227
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,880
this event here in the seven years of great famine,

228
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,239
this devastation led to desperate times.

229
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,000
We see number one, the.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,799
the devastation in Egypt, but I want you to see number two,

231
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,840
the desperation of the Egyptians.

232
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
I want you to notice what happens

233
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,359
and how God describes for us these desperate times

234
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,520
when there's no bread in all the land.

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
Of course, Joseph had bread.

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
He had stored up.

237
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,280
We went through that.

238
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,280
But understand, the average Egyptian,

239
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,120
they go out and their land's not bringing forth any fruit.

240
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
There's no yield.

241
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
There's no product.

242
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
There's nothing for them.

243
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,759
And so we find that the Bible tells us

244
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,159
as it started in chapter,

245
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,000
previously as we looked in chapter 41,

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,439
that they came and they bought from Joseph.

247
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,240
Now notice in verse 14,

248
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,080
and Joseph gathered up all the money

249
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,759
that was found in the land of Egypt

250
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,720
and in the land of Canaan for the corn,

251
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,819
which they bought, excuse me.

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,919
And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

253
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,040
Notice the next words in when money failed.

254
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,959
That's not real popular.

255
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,080
We live in a pretty affluent community.

256
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,680
No one thinks about money failing.

257
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
It's happened multiple times over the human history.

258
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,239
It's not just here.

259
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:22,639
It's happened, I mean, even in modern human history,

260
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,660
money fails.

261
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,940
You know, some trust in money,

262
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,900
but money failed, money failed.

263
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,779
And the Bible says, and money failed

264
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,620
in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan.

265
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
All the Egyptians came into Joseph

266
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,180
and notice what they said, give us bread.

267
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,300
For why should we die in thy presence?

268
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,860
For the money faileth.

269
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,660
They have no money to buy bread.

270
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,620
The desperation of the Egyptians is in view here.

271
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,139
We're gonna make application at the end,

272
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,180
but notice when money failed,

273
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,980
we begin noticing what takes place in verse 16.

274
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,459
Joseph said, give your cattle

275
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,919
and I will give you for your cattle if money fail.

276
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
So what do the people do?

277
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,580
Well, they gladly exchange their cattle for food.

278
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,500
Why?

279
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,259
Because they're hungry.

280
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,860
They need to eat.

281
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,020
The Bible says in verse 17,

282
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,059
and they brought their cattle into Joseph

283
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,899
and Joseph gave them bread in exchange

284
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,460
for horses and for the flocks

285
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,139
and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses.

286
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,820
And he fed them with bread for all their cattle

287
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,779
for that year.

288
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,660
Notice verse 18, when that year was ended,

289
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,940
they came unto him the second year.

290
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,899
There's still great famine.

291
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,339
And they say to Joseph, we will not hide it from my Lord.

292
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,660
How that our money is spent,

293
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,779
my Lord also hath our herds of cattle.

294
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,500
There is not ought left in thy sight of my Lord.

295
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,419
Notice the end of verse 18,

296
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,220
but our bodies and our lands.

297
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,059
Wherefore, verse 19, shall we die before thine eyes,

298
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,460
both we and our land by, notice what they say,

299
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,460
by us and our land for bread.

300
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,339
And we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh

301
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,820
and give a seed that we may live and not die

302
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,619
and the land be not desolate.

303
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,699
And Joseph bought, what does it say?

304
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:26,539
All the land of Egypt for Pharaoh.

305
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,580
For the Egyptians sold every man his field

306
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,820
because the famine prevailed over them.

307
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,500
So the land became Pharaoh's.

308
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,020
And as for the people, he removed them to cities

309
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,660
from one end to the borders of Egypt,

310
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,100
even to the other end thereof.

311
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,259
Only the land of the priests bought he not.

312
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,860
For the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh

313
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,059
and did eat their portion, which Pharaoh gave them.

314
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,380
Wherefore, they sold not their lands.

315
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,539
And so we find that as we look through

316
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,300
and notice the progression, if you will,

317
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,339
the desperation of the Egyptians, their money fails.

318
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,259
And they say, but we need food and we need sustenance.

319
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,179
And so we have these cattle, these livestock,

320
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,979
and we'll give you those in exchange for food.

321
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,619
And then they're out of livestock.

322
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,059
I mean, they've given all of their animals.

323
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,380
And they say, all that's left is us and our land.

324
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,699
And by us and our land will be your servants.

325
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:16,739
The land will be yours.

326
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,820
Just give us food.

327
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,739
Desperate times.

328
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:21,700
Can I tell you this evening,

329
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,420
it's hard for us to relate to something like this.

330
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,019
I don't think any of us have experienced anything like this.

331
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,980
Most of us, we go to the store.

332
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,859
There's plenty of things on the shelf, right?

333
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,820
I mean, I understand when the snowstorm's coming,

334
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,380
you might not be able to find certain items

335
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
and what have you and that kind of stuff happens.

336
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,260
I know during a few years ago

337
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,540
when we had all the situation going on,

338
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,579
but that was on a very minor scale

339
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,019
compared to what we're looking at here.

340
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,500
Amen?

341
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,980
I mean, it's desperate times.

342
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,019
Desperate times.

343
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,859
And the Bible says in verse 23,

344
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,660
then Joseph said unto the people,

345
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
behold, I have bought you this day

346
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,420
and your land for Pharaoh.

347
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,660
Lo, here's seed for you and ye shall sow the land.

348
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,980
So we find that as we look at this situation

349
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,739
as it unfolds and the desperation

350
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:20,420
and really the progression from their money being spent

351
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,220
to then they themselves and their land

352
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,059
being given to Pharaoh in exchange for food, for sustenance,

353
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,980
we find in verse 21 that they're relocated.

354
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,100
The Bible says that as for the people,

355
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,739
he removed them to cities from one end of the borders

356
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:38,859
of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

357
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,100
The priests are not touched.

358
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,179
According to verse number 29,

359
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,579
they have their portion assigned to them.

360
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,019
And we find that in verse 23 and verse number 24,

361
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,459
after they're relocated, they then are instructed.

362
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,739
Notice the instruction.

363
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:56,660
Joseph says here is seed at the end of verse 23 for you.

364
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,059
Notice, and ye shall sow the land.

365
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,420
Verse 24, and it shall come to pass

366
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,220
in the increase that ye shall give

367
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,420
the fifth part unto Pharaoh.

368
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,820
And four parts shall be your own

369
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
for seed of the field and for your food

370
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,380
and for them of your households

371
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,420
and for food for your little ones.

372
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,299
So we find that they were relocated,

373
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,739
they were instructed, and they obeyed the instruction

374
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,260
and therefore they survived.

375
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,019
As we look in verse 25, it says that they said,

376
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,220
thou hast saved our lives.

377
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,880
Listen, if Joseph wasn't there,

378
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,619
not only would his brothers not have found a place

379
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,820
and Jacob had not had a place to go,

380
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,799
if Joseph had failed to do what he was to do,

381
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,839
but the Egyptians, they would have died as well.

382
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,359
We find in verse 25, it says, and they said,

383
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,040
thou hast saved our lives.

384
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,160
Let us find grace in the sight of my Lord

385
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,920
and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

386
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,320
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt

387
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,880
unto this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth part

388
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,519
except the land of the priests only,

389
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,079
which became not Pharaoh's.

390
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,359
Two thoughts this evening

391
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,959
as we look at this portion of scripture

392
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,920
that I wanna really leave you with.

393
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,600
And the first thought is this,

394
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,600
that desperate times lead to some crazy things.

395
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm not sure we understand what the Bible tells us about

396
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
in the last days, in the end times.

397
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,920
I understand the way that God describes for us

398
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,640
the events of the tribulation.

399
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
I understand this evening that we,

400
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
thankfully, if you're saved by the blood of Christ,

401
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
that you're not gonna endure the tribulation.

402
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,799
God's going to rapture us out of here,

403
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,600
but I don't know how much we're going to experience

404
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,920
as far as the end times waxing worse and worse

405
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,359
and all of the desperate things that might take place.

406
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,359
See, before an antichrist can come and offer peace treaty

407
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,720
and offer all these things that's going to happen,

408
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,480
there's gotta be some real turmoil, amen?

409
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
And so we understand what's going to happen

410
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,519
after the rapture of the church.

411
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,600
I just don't know how much we're going to endure

412
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
before the rapture of the church.

413
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,480
Some people have offered their opinions

414
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,079
and as you study the scriptures,

415
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,359
we cannot say with absolute certainty

416
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,600
how much we may or may not endure.

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,880
And in fact, let me say this as Americans,

418
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,679
and I'm thankful to be an American,

419
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,519
but the reality is that there are brothers and sisters

420
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,559
around the globe tonight that are suffering greatly

421
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,520
while we're having it easy.

422
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,200
The idea that we're never going to suffer

423
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,159
because we're Americans is foreign to the Bible

424
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,239
because there are Christians all over the world that suffer,

425
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,039
that are affected by great tragedy.

426
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,679
We find that in the book of 2 Kings in chapter number six,

427
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
we won't take time to study all of it,

428
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,640
but I want you to see that in that passage of scripture,

429
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,719
there was a great famine

430
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:04,359
and this is obviously the result of God's judgment

431
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,280
because of the wickedness in Israel.

432
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,960
And in 2 Kings chapter six,

433
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,119
notice just taking a few verses here

434
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,559
from this portion of scripture,

435
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,559
it's preceding when Elisha says that there would be bread

436
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,840
and there would be food, there would be an abundance.

437
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,039
And of course, the servant did not believe.

438
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,919
And he said, if the windows would be open of heaven,

439
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,039
might this thing be?

440
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,039
And of course, those four leprous men in chapter number seven

441
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,239
they go out and they find the camp deserted

442
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,760
and there's plenty.

443
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,880
But prior to that, in chapter number six of 2 Kings,

444
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,760
the Bible tells us this in verse number 26,

445
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
it's hard for me to relate to this, this is Bible.

446
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
This happened, notice in verse 26,

447
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,960
and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall,

448
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,719
there cried a woman unto him saying, help my Lord, O king.

449
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:59,039
And he said, verse 27, if the Lord did not help thee,

450
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,359
when shall I help thee?

451
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,359
Out of the barn floor, out of the wine press, they had nothing.

452
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,359
In fact, the Bible says that the great famine, according to verse number 25,

453
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,359
it was so great that an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver

454
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,359
and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver.

455
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,359
A bad time.

456
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,359
In verse 28, the Bible says that the king said unto her,

457
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,359
What aileth thee?

458
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,359
Notice what she says.

459
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,359
She answered, This woman, this woman said unto me,

460
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,359
Give thy son that we may eat him today.

461
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,359
I can't even begin to comprehend that.

462
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,359
I can't.

463
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,359
And we will eat my son tomorrow.

464
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,359
Verse 29, So we boiled my son.

465
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,359
Again, I can't even begin to comprehend.

466
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,359
And did eat him.

467
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,359
And I said unto her on the next day,

468
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,359
Give thy son that we may eat him.

469
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,359
And she hath hid her son.

470
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,359
That's crazy.

471
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,359
Desperate times, people do crazy things.

472
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Seriously.

473
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,359
Did you see what happened in 2020?

474
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,359
People did some crazy things.

475
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,359
I mean crazy things.

476
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,359
The Bible tells us in Revelation 13,

477
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,359
that during the tribulation, people are going to take this mark of the beast.

478
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,359
Now, we're not going to be here.

479
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,359
If you're saved, you're not going to be here.

480
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,359
Amen?

481
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,359
What a blessing.

482
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,359
But understand, they're going to take this mark of the beast.

483
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,359
Why?

484
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,359
Well, notice what the Bible says.

485
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,359
I'm going to read it to you in Revelation 13,

486
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,359
in verse 16 and 17.

487
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,359
It's very plain.

488
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,359
And you see what's happening here.

489
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,359
Revelation 13, this is the midpoint of the tribulation.

490
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,359
And it says in Revelation 13, in verse 16,

491
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,359
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,

492
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,359
to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.

493
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,359
And that no man, notice what it says, might buy or sell,

494
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,359
save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast,

495
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,359
or the number of his name.

496
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,359
So we're just going to say, you can't buy or sell,

497
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,359
unless you have this.

498
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,359
You know, people are going to get it.

499
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,359
Because they're going to be desperate.

500
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,359
There may be some people that say, yeah, I'm not going to do that.

501
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,359
They get hungry enough.

502
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,359
I think there are going to be people that line up and say,

503
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,359
do you want to put it here or here?

504
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,359
You can do both if you want.

505
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,359
Honestly.

506
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,359
People are going to do crazy stuff.

507
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,359
Why are we saying that?

508
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,359
Well, we see what happens in Egypt during this great famine.

509
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,359
We see what happens in Israel in 2 Kings 6.

510
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,359
We understand what's going to happen in Revelation 13.

511
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,359
And as we begin to think about our lives and think about where we are,

512
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:52,359
there are going to be some things that we face.

513
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,359
We've got to keep our eyes on the Lord.

514
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,359
Keep our eyes on the Lord.

515
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,359
People do crazy stuff during times of desperation.

516
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,359
It's interesting to me as you read chapter 47,

517
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:10,359
the distinction in Genesis 47 between what's happening with the children of Israel

518
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,359
and what's happening with the Egyptians.

519
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,359
And if you understand typology at all, there's a typology of the Egyptians.

520
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,359
Egypt is a picture of the world.

521
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:28,359
Jacob, Israel, God's people.

522
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,359
The church is not Israel.

523
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,359
Okay, understand that.

524
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,359
The church is not Israel.

525
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,359
We're not claiming to be spiritual Israel.

526
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,359
But we are God's people.

527
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,359
Amen?

528
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,359
To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.

529
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,359
Behold, what manner of the love the Father hath bestowed upon us

530
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,359
that we should be called the sons of God.

531
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,359
To God be the glory.

532
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,359
We're his people.

533
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,359
We're a royal priesthood according to Peter.

534
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,359
A chosen generation.

535
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,359
Praise the Lord.

536
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,359
God's going to take care of us.

537
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,359
There's one thought from this passage.

538
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,359
Let me give you a second thought before we close tonight.

539
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,359
I want you to think about Joseph just for a moment.

540
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,359
I want you to think about how God used one man.

541
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,359
How God used one man.

542
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,359
I want you to think about tonight how God wants to use you.

543
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,359
How God wants to use you.

544
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:29,359
See, because if Joseph wasn't faithful, if Joseph didn't do,

545
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,359
now all we can say is hypothetically what the consequences would have been

546
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:37,359
because Joseph did fulfill.

547
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,359
But Ezekiel says that God said,

548
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,359
I sought for a man among them that would make up a hedge,

549
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,359
that would stand in the gap.

550
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,359
But he says, I found none.

551
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,359
God uses individuals.

552
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,359
God uses people.

553
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,359
And God used Joseph in an amazing way.

554
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:03,359
God revealed something to Joseph, and then Joseph had to do something with it.

555
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,359
Joseph was the one that God gave the plan to.

556
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,359
He didn't give the plan to Pharaoh.

557
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,359
He didn't give the plan to any of Pharaoh's magicians or astrologers.

558
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,359
No, he gave it to Joseph.

559
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,359
Joseph faithfully gave the plan to Pharaoh,

560
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,359
and Pharaoh then put Joseph in charge of implementing, carrying out the plan.

561
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,359
And Joseph was faithful this evening.

562
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,359
God wants to use you.

563
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,359
God wants to use me.

564
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,359
He uses individuals.

565
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:41,359
God chose, for whatever reason, God chose to use people.

566
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,359
He didn't write the gospel message in the stars.

567
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,359
He didn't cause for the rocks to cry out the gospel message.

568
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,359
No, he said, that's our job.

569
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,359
The heavens declare the glory of God.

570
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,359
The firmament showeth forth his handiwork.

571
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:02,359
But you can't get saved by looking at the stars.

572
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,359
The stars can reveal to you that there's a God.

573
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,359
Amen?

574
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,359
Cornelius had a vision.

575
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,359
The angel couldn't tell Cornelius how to get saved.

576
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,359
In fact, Peter says they look into it, but they don't understand it.

577
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,359
You know why they don't understand it?

578
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,359
Because they can't be redeemed.

579
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,359
Only we can.

580
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,359
And Cornelius gets a vision.

581
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,359
You know what God says?

582
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,359
Go find Peter.

583
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,359
And when you find Peter, he's going to tell you.

584
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,359
You know what Peter does?

585
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,359
He gets there to a crowd.

586
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,359
They're ready.

587
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,359
They're assembled for him.

588
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,359
And Peter gives them the gospel, and they get saved.

589
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,359
What if Peter had been disobedient?

590
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,359
I mean, we could say that over and over of biblical accounts and characters,

591
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,359
God wants to use us like he used Joseph and David and Peter and fill in the blank.

592
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,359
This evening, we have to just determine we're going to be faithful to God.

593
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,359
We're going to let God use us.

594
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,359
God, what do you want with my life?

595
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,359
God, I want to serve you, but only if it's easy.

596
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,359
Only if it's in this easy place and there's no problems.

597
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,359
No!

598
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,359
Sometimes there's going to be some great difficulty, but God's going to use us.

599
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,359
Think about some of the things the disciples endured.

600
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,359
And the disciples, they endured some great things, difficulties, but God used them.

601
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,359
See, God wants to use you tonight.

602
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,359
We see that during desperate times, people do crazy things.

603
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,359
We see that from this passage of Scripture.

604
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,359
But we see tonight that God uses individuals.

605
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,359
Don't you want God to use you?

606
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,359
Not for you, but use you for his honor and for his glory.

607
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,359
Use you so that his name would be exalted and magnified.

608
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,359
Oh, I trust tonight that we'd say, Lord, use us.

609
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,359
Here's my life, Lord.

610
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,359
Let it be.

611
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,359
Lord, use me for your honor and for your glory.

612
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,359
Let's pray.

613
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,359
Father, we love you.

614
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,359
We thank you for loving us.

615
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,359
We thank you for the privilege of being able to be your children.

616
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,359
We thank you for your watch care over us.

617
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,359
We thank you for your provision, your protection for us.

618
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,359
We thank you for the privilege of knowing you and serving you.

619
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,359
And God, I pray you'd help us to understand that you use people.

620
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,359
And tonight, Lord, help us to be surrendered and yielded.

621
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:27,359
Help us, Lord, to be willing to follow you wherever you would lead us.

622
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,359
Lord, that we might be used for your honor and glory.

623
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,359
And we'll thank you for it.

624
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,359
Would you stand with me?

625
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,359
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

626
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,359
We'll have a moment of invitation.

627
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,359
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
