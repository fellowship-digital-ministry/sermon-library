WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
25 or 30 minutes tonight.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.159
We got time for a quiz and birthday fellowship

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:05.079
and all of that.

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:06.679
And Genesis 47.

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.500
Last week, we started looking at Genesis 47.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.079
We mentioned it'd be a two-part series.

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.479
This evening, we'll be looking at verses 13 through 26.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.319
But let me just remind you quickly

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.200
as to what we addressed last week

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.879
as we looked at verses one through 12

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.040
and then verse 28 through 31.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200
And we titled the message last Sunday evening,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.399
Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.200
And we learned some very important things

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
as we look at how God provided for his people in Egypt.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.680
Remember in Genesis chapter 46,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.919
God had given promises to Jacob

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:41.439
before he left with regard for the journey.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.040
And God had given him protection

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.639
a while they were journeying.

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:47.279
And then they arrive in Egypt

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.799
and we find that God gave them a place.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.319
And the Bible tells us in Genesis 47

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.959
that it wasn't just any place that God gave to his people.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.119
We find that he moved in the heart of Pharaoh

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.759
and by the way, reference the morning message,

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.080
God moved in the heart of Pharaoh.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.760
And Pharaoh said to Joseph,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.599
give them of the best of the land.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.120
And God gave them the best.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.680
He didn't just give them a place,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.319
he gave them the best place.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.680
And we said last week that part of the understanding

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
that we have is that Jacob was in God's will

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.800
and we're in God's will.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.199
God takes good care of us.

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:22.480
God provides for us.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.440
And we see that God gave them a place,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.519
not only a place, but provision.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.360
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 12

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.680
that Joseph nourished his father, his brethren

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680
and all his father's household

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.279
with bread according to their families.

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:40.319
We understand the picture of forgiveness.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.800
He didn't just nourish his father,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.000
he nourished his father and his brethren

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.480
and their families and how God provided.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760
Joseph had made the promise to his family

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.440
when he sent his brothers back.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.319
He said, return and I will nourish you.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.000
And we find that Joseph fulfilled

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.160
what he had committed to do.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.440
And then of course, we ended the message last week

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.160
by speaking about Jacob and how he had the opportunity

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.679
really to reflect on his pilgrimage

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.399
and how each of us at times in our lives,

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.759
we need to examine our lives,

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.919
see where we've been, where we're going.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.440
And if God would give us more days,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
weeks and months and years ahead

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.679
that we would serve him faithfully.

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.919
As we come to the text of scripture this evening,

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.240
it's very interesting as you look at Genesis 47

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.080
because part of it, and it's not really half and half,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.399
but a portion of it deals with the children of Israel

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.679
in Egypt, but then the section that we're gonna look at

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.039
this evening in verses 13 through 26

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.479
really focuses in on the Egyptians

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.000
and life in Egypt during this great famine.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.940
And again, we find that God's already provided to us

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.639
as we studied last week, how God gave his people a place

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.600
and he gave them provision,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.679
but notice the Bible tells us in verse 13,

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:01.360
and there was no bread in all the land.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.279
That's the title for the message this evening,

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.720
no bread in all the land.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.000
As we begin to understand what's taking place,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.759
we find that God is at work and God is fulfilling

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.160
the promises that he had given to Joseph.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.679
And again, God had been working for years

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.440
with regard to preparing all of these things.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.919
And we find that as I referenced last week

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.679
in Psalm 37 and 25, you don't need to turn there,

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.240
but David says, I have been young and now I'm old,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.160
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.639
nor his seed begging bread.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.919
And I'm thankful for how God took care of his people,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.119
even in the midst of great difficulty.

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.880
By the way, our God can take care of us, amen.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.880
Our God is the great shepherd

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.679
and the shepherd provides for the sheep.

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:54.399
And I'm so thankful that our God is able

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:55.559
and as we trust him,

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.320
but as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.600
we remember that God had revealed to Joseph

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.479
through Pharaoh's dream

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.399
that there would be seven years of famine.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.639
I want you to hold your place here in Genesis 47

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.399
and just for a moment, turn back to chapter 41

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:14.679
and I want you to see how God back then in chapter 41

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:18.239
described this period of famine.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.119
Notice with me in Genesis 41

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:23.359
as Joseph is interpreting Pharaoh's dream,

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:25.839
notice what the Bible says in verse number 30.

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:28.720
In Genesis 41 in verse 30,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.079
the Bible says, and there shall arise after them,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:34.720
after the seven years of great plenty, seven years of famine.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.040
Notice it says, and all the plenty shall be what?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.279
Shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.880
Those years of great plenty,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.720
this seven years of great famine, this dearth,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600
it was going to be so bad

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.040
that the years of plenty were going to be forgotten.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.679
It says this, and the famine,

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:54.079
notice the end of verse 30,

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.000
shall consume the land.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.559
It says in verse number 31,

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.640
and the plenty shall not be known in the land

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.920
by reason of the famine, that famine following.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.880
Notice for it, the great famine shall be very grievous.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.880
We find that God of course gave Joseph a plan.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.880
He explains that to Pharaoh in the next several verses,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.600
and he has set a second in command of all of Egypt

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.320
in order to provide and to plan for the future

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.679
during those seven years of great plenty

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:26.839
so that the land would not be

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.359
totally desolated from population.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:31.519
But as we get a look at this passage of scripture,

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.480
I want you to notice if you're taking notes tonight

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.760
from verse number 13, number one,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.799
the devastation in Egypt, the devastation in Egypt.

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.399
We find that in the midst of this great famine

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.679
that we see how this is described for us in verse number 13.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.480
I mean, it is utter devastation that we see.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.600
It says this, there's no bread in the land,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.519
no bread in all the land, but notice it says this,

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.279
for the famine was very sore.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.760
So the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.440
fainted by reason of the famine.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.239
I want you to understand that as we look

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:08.600
at this portion of scripture

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.119
and we see what's taking place here and what's recorded,

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.679
this is not an embellished account

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.519
for the purpose of writing.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.600
This is literally what was taking place in Egypt.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.119
This was the effect of this great famine.

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:24.160
After seven years of great plenty,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.880
we find that Joseph had mentioned previously

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.440
that they were only two years into the famine.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.640
There were still five years left.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.279
And the Bible tells us that there was no bread

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.119
in all the land of Egypt.

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.239
It says that the famine was very sore.

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:43.440
It says that the people fainted because of the famine.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.000
Now understand this evening,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.880
I know we've said at different times,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.040
children are great at saying, I'm starving, right?

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.720
And they have this idea

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.359
that they're going to just die of hunger.

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:56.320
Well, here, these people literally,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.119
I mean, it was a terrible, terrible time.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.880
We find that the Bible tells us

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.119
that this famine had a far-reaching impact.

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.200
Back in chapter 41, the Bible described

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.040
that even at the very start of the famine,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.679
those beginning years,

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:20.679
the Bible tells us that it was over all the face of the earth

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.399
and it tells us that all countries came into Egypt

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.839
to Joseph for to buy corn.

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.959
This is a terrible time.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.160
I mean, the devastation that's in Egypt,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.679
but I'm thankful that even in this period of devastation

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:36.959
that God had given Joseph wisdom and direction

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.519
and provided a plan.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.920
And during those seven years of great plenty,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.600
Joseph was preparing.

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:45.119
Joseph was preparing.

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:47.640
In fact, we find that as he's preparing,

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.399
it was a very simple plan that he outlined in chapter 41.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:55.359
He tells Pharaoh that during the time of plenty,

00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:59.320
that what they're to do in verse number 35 of chapter 41,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.239
he says, let them gather all the food

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.040
of those good years that come

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.200
and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.480
and let them keep food in the cities.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.160
And that food shall be for store to the land

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.920
against the seven years of famine,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.359
which shall be in the land of Egypt

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.480
that the land perish not through the famine.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.440
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.920
and the eyes of all his servants.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.119
And the Bible tells us in verse 46,

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:23.959
Joseph was 30 years old

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:26.119
when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:28.000
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.480
and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.519
And what did he do?

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:32.039
Well, in those seven plenteous years,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.000
the earth brought forth by handfuls.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.559
I mean, in abundance, it was great plenty.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.039
And the Bible says in verse 48,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.479
that he gathered up all the food of the seven years,

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.760
which were in the land of Egypt

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.080
and laid up the food in the cities,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.599
the food of the field, which was round about every city,

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:47.159
laid he up in the same.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:51.039
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea,

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:56.039
very much until he left numbering for it was without number.

00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:00.280
By the way, I'm thankful for Joseph.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.359
Being in a place that was foreign to him,

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:06.640
being in a place that the circumstances

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.960
surrounding his arrival are less than desirous

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.640
and all that he experienced

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.799
and how easy it would be to say,

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.719
no, I'm not gonna do it and have a pity party

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:19.719
and woe is me and life isn't fair.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.599
But Joseph said to his brothers,

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:25.840
God sent me before you to preserve life.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.080
He had a view of God that was biblical,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.919
view of God that we as 21st century Christians

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:36.239
need to have our God is sovereign,

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:38.679
our God is able, our God is in control.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.559
And we find this evening that Joseph was faithful.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:45.640
We see from verse number 13, the devastation in Egypt,

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.280
but we notice this catastrophic event

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.799
and all that's taking place,

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:53.880
this event here in the seven years of great famine,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.239
this devastation led to desperate times.

00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:00.000
We see number one, the.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.799
the devastation in Egypt, but I want you to see number two,

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.840
the desperation of the Egyptians.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.600
I want you to notice what happens

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.359
and how God describes for us these desperate times

00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:14.520
when there's no bread in all the land.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.360
Of course, Joseph had bread.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.200
He had stored up.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.280
We went through that.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.280
But understand, the average Egyptian,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.120
they go out and their land's not bringing forth any fruit.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.040
There's no yield.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.440
There's no product.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.440
There's nothing for them.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.759
And so we find that the Bible tells us

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.159
as it started in chapter,

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:38.000
previously as we looked in chapter 41,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.439
that they came and they bought from Joseph.

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:43.240
Now notice in verse 14,

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.080
and Joseph gathered up all the money

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.759
that was found in the land of Egypt

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.720
and in the land of Canaan for the corn,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.819
which they bought, excuse me.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.919
And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:03.040
Notice the next words in when money failed.

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:05.959
That's not real popular.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.080
We live in a pretty affluent community.

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:13.680
No one thinks about money failing.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.839
It's happened multiple times over the human history.

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:19.239
It's not just here.

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:22.639
It's happened, I mean, even in modern human history,

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:23.660
money fails.

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.940
You know, some trust in money,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.900
but money failed, money failed.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.779
And the Bible says, and money failed

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.620
in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.620
All the Egyptians came into Joseph

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.180
and notice what they said, give us bread.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.300
For why should we die in thy presence?

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.860
For the money faileth.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.660
They have no money to buy bread.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:53.620
The desperation of the Egyptians is in view here.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.139
We're gonna make application at the end,

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:57.180
but notice when money failed,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.980
we begin noticing what takes place in verse 16.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.459
Joseph said, give your cattle

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:05.919
and I will give you for your cattle if money fail.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.240
So what do the people do?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.580
Well, they gladly exchange their cattle for food.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.500
Why?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.259
Because they're hungry.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:15.860
They need to eat.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.020
The Bible says in verse 17,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.059
and they brought their cattle into Joseph

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:21.899
and Joseph gave them bread in exchange

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:23.460
for horses and for the flocks

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.139
and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses.

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:28.820
And he fed them with bread for all their cattle

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.779
for that year.

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:34.660
Notice verse 18, when that year was ended,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.940
they came unto him the second year.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.899
There's still great famine.

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:43.339
And they say to Joseph, we will not hide it from my Lord.

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:45.660
How that our money is spent,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.779
my Lord also hath our herds of cattle.

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:52.500
There is not ought left in thy sight of my Lord.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.419
Notice the end of verse 18,

00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:58.220
but our bodies and our lands.

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:04.059
Wherefore, verse 19, shall we die before thine eyes,

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:07.460
both we and our land by, notice what they say,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.460
by us and our land for bread.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.339
And we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.820
and give a seed that we may live and not die

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.619
and the land be not desolate.

00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:23.699
And Joseph bought, what does it say?

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:26.539
All the land of Egypt for Pharaoh.

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.580
For the Egyptians sold every man his field

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.820
because the famine prevailed over them.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.500
So the land became Pharaoh's.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.020
And as for the people, he removed them to cities

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.660
from one end to the borders of Egypt,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.100
even to the other end thereof.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.259
Only the land of the priests bought he not.

00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:43.860
For the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.059
and did eat their portion, which Pharaoh gave them.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.380
Wherefore, they sold not their lands.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.539
And so we find that as we look through

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:53.300
and notice the progression, if you will,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.339
the desperation of the Egyptians, their money fails.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:59.259
And they say, but we need food and we need sustenance.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:02.179
And so we have these cattle, these livestock,

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:04.979
and we'll give you those in exchange for food.

00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:07.619
And then they're out of livestock.

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:09.059
I mean, they've given all of their animals.

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:12.380
And they say, all that's left is us and our land.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.699
And by us and our land will be your servants.

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:16.739
The land will be yours.

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:18.820
Just give us food.

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.739
Desperate times.

00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:21.700
Can I tell you this evening,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.420
it's hard for us to relate to something like this.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.019
I don't think any of us have experienced anything like this.

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:32.980
Most of us, we go to the store.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.859
There's plenty of things on the shelf, right?

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:38.820
I mean, I understand when the snowstorm's coming,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.380
you might not be able to find certain items

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.540
and what have you and that kind of stuff happens.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.260
I know during a few years ago

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.540
when we had all the situation going on,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.579
but that was on a very minor scale

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:53.019
compared to what we're looking at here.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:54.500
Amen?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.980
I mean, it's desperate times.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.019
Desperate times.

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:01.859
And the Bible says in verse 23,

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.660
then Joseph said unto the people,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.660
behold, I have bought you this day

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.420
and your land for Pharaoh.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.660
Lo, here's seed for you and ye shall sow the land.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.980
So we find that as we look at this situation

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:16.739
as it unfolds and the desperation

00:15:16.739 --> 00:15:20.420
and really the progression from their money being spent

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.220
to then they themselves and their land

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.059
being given to Pharaoh in exchange for food, for sustenance,

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.980
we find in verse 21 that they're relocated.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.100
The Bible says that as for the people,

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.739
he removed them to cities from one end of the borders

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:38.859
of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:40.100
The priests are not touched.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.179
According to verse number 29,

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:43.579
they have their portion assigned to them.

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:48.019
And we find that in verse 23 and verse number 24,

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:51.459
after they're relocated, they then are instructed.

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:52.739
Notice the instruction.

00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:56.660
Joseph says here is seed at the end of verse 23 for you.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.059
Notice, and ye shall sow the land.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.420
Verse 24, and it shall come to pass

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.220
in the increase that ye shall give

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.420
the fifth part unto Pharaoh.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.820
And four parts shall be your own

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.820
for seed of the field and for your food

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.380
and for them of your households

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.420
and for food for your little ones.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.299
So we find that they were relocated,

00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:22.739
they were instructed, and they obeyed the instruction

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:24.260
and therefore they survived.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.019
As we look in verse 25, it says that they said,

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.220
thou hast saved our lives.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.880
Listen, if Joseph wasn't there,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.619
not only would his brothers not have found a place

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:38.820
and Jacob had not had a place to go,

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.799
if Joseph had failed to do what he was to do,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.839
but the Egyptians, they would have died as well.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.359
We find in verse 25, it says, and they said,

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:52.040
thou hast saved our lives.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.160
Let us find grace in the sight of my Lord

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.920
and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.320
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.880
unto this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth part

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.519
except the land of the priests only,

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:07.079
which became not Pharaoh's.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.359
Two thoughts this evening

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.959
as we look at this portion of scripture

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.920
that I wanna really leave you with.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.600
And the first thought is this,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.600
that desperate times lead to some crazy things.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.640
I'm not sure we understand what the Bible tells us about

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.040
in the last days, in the end times.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.920
I understand the way that God describes for us

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.640
the events of the tribulation.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.600
I understand this evening that we,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.760
thankfully, if you're saved by the blood of Christ,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.320
that you're not gonna endure the tribulation.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.799
God's going to rapture us out of here,

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:46.600
but I don't know how much we're going to experience

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.920
as far as the end times waxing worse and worse

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.359
and all of the desperate things that might take place.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:59.359
See, before an antichrist can come and offer peace treaty

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:01.720
and offer all these things that's going to happen,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.480
there's gotta be some real turmoil, amen?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.880
And so we understand what's going to happen

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.519
after the rapture of the church.

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:13.600
I just don't know how much we're going to endure

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.000
before the rapture of the church.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.480
Some people have offered their opinions

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.079
and as you study the scriptures,

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:22.359
we cannot say with absolute certainty

00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:24.600
how much we may or may not endure.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.880
And in fact, let me say this as Americans,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.679
and I'm thankful to be an American,

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:31.519
but the reality is that there are brothers and sisters

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:34.559
around the globe tonight that are suffering greatly

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.520
while we're having it easy.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.200
The idea that we're never going to suffer

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.159
because we're Americans is foreign to the Bible

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:47.239
because there are Christians all over the world that suffer,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.039
that are affected by great tragedy.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.679
We find that in the book of 2 Kings in chapter number six,

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:57.840
we won't take time to study all of it,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.640
but I want you to see that in that passage of scripture,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.719
there was a great famine

00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:04.359
and this is obviously the result of God's judgment

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:06.280
because of the wickedness in Israel.

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:07.960
And in 2 Kings chapter six,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.119
notice just taking a few verses here

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.559
from this portion of scripture,

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:17.559
it's preceding when Elisha says that there would be bread

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.840
and there would be food, there would be an abundance.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.039
And of course, the servant did not believe.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:28.919
And he said, if the windows would be open of heaven,

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:30.039
might this thing be?

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:34.039
And of course, those four leprous men in chapter number seven

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.239
they go out and they find the camp deserted

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:37.760
and there's plenty.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.880
But prior to that, in chapter number six of 2 Kings,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.760
the Bible tells us this in verse number 26,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.880
it's hard for me to relate to this, this is Bible.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.960
This happened, notice in verse 26,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.960
and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall,

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.719
there cried a woman unto him saying, help my Lord, O king.

00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:59.039
And he said, verse 27, if the Lord did not help thee,

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.359
when shall I help thee?

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:03.359
Out of the barn floor, out of the wine press, they had nothing.

00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:06.359
In fact, the Bible says that the great famine, according to verse number 25,

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:11.359
it was so great that an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:16.359
and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver.

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:19.359
A bad time.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:21.359
In verse 28, the Bible says that the king said unto her,

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:23.359
What aileth thee?

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.359
Notice what she says.

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:29.359
She answered, This woman, this woman said unto me,

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:34.359
Give thy son that we may eat him today.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.359
I can't even begin to comprehend that.

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:40.359
I can't.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:45.359
And we will eat my son tomorrow.

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:47.359
Verse 29, So we boiled my son.

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:50.359
Again, I can't even begin to comprehend.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.359
And did eat him.

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:52.359
And I said unto her on the next day,

00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:54.359
Give thy son that we may eat him.

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:57.359
And she hath hid her son.

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:01.359
That's crazy.

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:04.359
Desperate times, people do crazy things.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:07.359
Seriously.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:10.359
Did you see what happened in 2020?

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:13.359
People did some crazy things.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:17.359
I mean crazy things.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:21.359
The Bible tells us in Revelation 13,

00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:25.359
that during the tribulation, people are going to take this mark of the beast.

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:28.359
Now, we're not going to be here.

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:30.359
If you're saved, you're not going to be here.

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:31.359
Amen?

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.359
What a blessing.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:36.359
But understand, they're going to take this mark of the beast.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.359
Why?

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.359
Well, notice what the Bible says.

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:41.359
I'm going to read it to you in Revelation 13,

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:42.359
in verse 16 and 17.

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:44.359
It's very plain.

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:47.359
And you see what's happening here.

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:52.359
Revelation 13, this is the midpoint of the tribulation.

00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:54.359
And it says in Revelation 13, in verse 16,

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:59.359
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:02.359
to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.

00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:06.359
And that no man, notice what it says, might buy or sell,

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:10.359
save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast,

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:12.359
or the number of his name.

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:14.359
So we're just going to say, you can't buy or sell,

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:16.359
unless you have this.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:18.359
You know, people are going to get it.

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:20.359
Because they're going to be desperate.

00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:22.359
There may be some people that say, yeah, I'm not going to do that.

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.359
They get hungry enough.

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:26.359
I think there are going to be people that line up and say,

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:27.359
do you want to put it here or here?

00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:29.359
You can do both if you want.

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:30.359
Honestly.

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:32.359
People are going to do crazy stuff.

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:33.359
Why are we saying that?

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:36.359
Well, we see what happens in Egypt during this great famine.

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:40.359
We see what happens in Israel in 2 Kings 6.

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:43.359
We understand what's going to happen in Revelation 13.

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:46.359
And as we begin to think about our lives and think about where we are,

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:52.359
there are going to be some things that we face.

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:55.359
We've got to keep our eyes on the Lord.

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.359
Keep our eyes on the Lord.

00:22:56.359 --> 00:23:00.359
People do crazy stuff during times of desperation.

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:02.359
It's interesting to me as you read chapter 47,

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:10.359
the distinction in Genesis 47 between what's happening with the children of Israel

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:13.359
and what's happening with the Egyptians.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:18.359
And if you understand typology at all, there's a typology of the Egyptians.

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:22.359
Egypt is a picture of the world.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:28.359
Jacob, Israel, God's people.

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:30.359
The church is not Israel.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:31.359
Okay, understand that.

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:32.359
The church is not Israel.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:34.359
We're not claiming to be spiritual Israel.

00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:36.359
But we are God's people.

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:37.359
Amen?

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:42.359
To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:45.359
Behold, what manner of the love the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:49.359
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:23:49.359 --> 00:23:50.359
To God be the glory.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:52.359
We're his people.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:55.359
We're a royal priesthood according to Peter.

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:57.359
A chosen generation.

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.359
Praise the Lord.

00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:01.359
God's going to take care of us.

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:03.359
There's one thought from this passage.

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:05.359
Let me give you a second thought before we close tonight.

00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:08.359
I want you to think about Joseph just for a moment.

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:11.359
I want you to think about how God used one man.

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:15.359
How God used one man.

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:19.359
I want you to think about tonight how God wants to use you.

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:22.359
How God wants to use you.

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:29.359
See, because if Joseph wasn't faithful, if Joseph didn't do,

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:34.359
now all we can say is hypothetically what the consequences would have been

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:37.359
because Joseph did fulfill.

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:39.359
But Ezekiel says that God said,

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:42.359
I sought for a man among them that would make up a hedge,

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:43.359
that would stand in the gap.

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:48.359
But he says, I found none.

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:51.359
God uses individuals.

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:54.359
God uses people.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.359
And God used Joseph in an amazing way.

00:24:56.359 --> 00:25:03.359
God revealed something to Joseph, and then Joseph had to do something with it.

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:07.359
Joseph was the one that God gave the plan to.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:09.359
He didn't give the plan to Pharaoh.

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:13.359
He didn't give the plan to any of Pharaoh's magicians or astrologers.

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:16.359
No, he gave it to Joseph.

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:19.359
Joseph faithfully gave the plan to Pharaoh,

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:24.359
and Pharaoh then put Joseph in charge of implementing, carrying out the plan.

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:28.359
And Joseph was faithful this evening.

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:29.359
God wants to use you.

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:31.359
God wants to use me.

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:33.359
He uses individuals.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:41.359
God chose, for whatever reason, God chose to use people.

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:44.359
He didn't write the gospel message in the stars.

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:48.359
He didn't cause for the rocks to cry out the gospel message.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:52.359
No, he said, that's our job.

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:54.359
The heavens declare the glory of God.

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:56.359
The firmament showeth forth his handiwork.

00:25:56.359 --> 00:26:02.359
But you can't get saved by looking at the stars.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:05.359
The stars can reveal to you that there's a God.

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:08.359
Amen?

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:12.359
Cornelius had a vision.

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:17.359
The angel couldn't tell Cornelius how to get saved.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:21.359
In fact, Peter says they look into it, but they don't understand it.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:22.359
You know why they don't understand it?

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:25.359
Because they can't be redeemed.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.359
Only we can.

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:30.359
And Cornelius gets a vision.

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:32.359
You know what God says?

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:35.359
Go find Peter.

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:39.359
And when you find Peter, he's going to tell you.

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:40.359
You know what Peter does?

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:41.359
He gets there to a crowd.

00:26:41.359 --> 00:26:42.359
They're ready.

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:43.359
They're assembled for him.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:46.359
And Peter gives them the gospel, and they get saved.

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:48.359
What if Peter had been disobedient?

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:52.359
I mean, we could say that over and over of biblical accounts and characters,

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:59.359
God wants to use us like he used Joseph and David and Peter and fill in the blank.

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:03.359
This evening, we have to just determine we're going to be faithful to God.

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:05.359
We're going to let God use us.

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:07.359
God, what do you want with my life?

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:10.359
God, I want to serve you, but only if it's easy.

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:12.359
Only if it's in this easy place and there's no problems.

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:15.359
No!

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:19.359
Sometimes there's going to be some great difficulty, but God's going to use us.

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:22.359
Think about some of the things the disciples endured.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:27.359
And the disciples, they endured some great things, difficulties, but God used them.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:29.359
See, God wants to use you tonight.

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:32.359
We see that during desperate times, people do crazy things.

00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:34.359
We see that from this passage of Scripture.

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:37.359
But we see tonight that God uses individuals.

00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:39.359
Don't you want God to use you?

00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:43.359
Not for you, but use you for his honor and for his glory.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:48.359
Use you so that his name would be exalted and magnified.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:51.359
Oh, I trust tonight that we'd say, Lord, use us.

00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:53.359
Here's my life, Lord.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.359
Let it be.

00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:56.359
Lord, use me for your honor and for your glory.

00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:57.359
Let's pray.

00:27:57.359 --> 00:27:58.359
Father, we love you.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:27:59.359
We thank you for loving us.

00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:04.359
We thank you for the privilege of being able to be your children.

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:07.359
We thank you for your watch care over us.

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:10.359
We thank you for your provision, your protection for us.

00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:13.359
We thank you for the privilege of knowing you and serving you.

00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:17.359
And God, I pray you'd help us to understand that you use people.

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:20.359
And tonight, Lord, help us to be surrendered and yielded.

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:27.359
Help us, Lord, to be willing to follow you wherever you would lead us.

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:29.359
Lord, that we might be used for your honor and glory.

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:30.359
And we'll thank you for it.

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:31.359
Would you stand with me?

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:33.359
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:35.359
We'll have a moment of invitation.

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:39.359
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:47.359
