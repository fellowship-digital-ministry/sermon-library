1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
39 tonight, Genesis chapter 39, and last Sunday evening we started looking at

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,280
this portion of Scripture

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,479
and we only made it through the first six verses and so this evening we'll

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,560
look at verses 7 through 19

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,720
here in the 39th chapter of the book of Genesis

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,479
and let me just remind you very quickly as we began studying this portion of

7
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:20,879
Scripture last week

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,559
and we noted the fact that the Bible tells us that the Lord was with

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,120
In verse number 2 of Genesis 39, the Bible says the Lord was with Joseph

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,799
again in verse number 3

11
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:35,720
of our text of Scripture, the Bible says that his master, that's Potiphar,

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,840
he saw that the Lord was with him. If you skip down to verse number 21, the

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,080
Bible says again

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,919
after he, Joseph, was accused and then imprisoned

15
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:50,040
the Bible tells us in verse number 21, but the Lord was with Joseph

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,880
and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,000
and then notice in verse 23, the fourth time in this chapter where the Bible

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,560
says

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,480
the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,319
the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,199
it to prosper. I'm thankful for the testimony of Joseph

22
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:18,220
I'm thankful for a man that though he was sold into slavery, his brothers

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,000
despised him, were going to kill him and then sold him into slavery

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,239
We understand as we begin reading even at the end of the 37th chapter and then the

25
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,559
beginning of the 39th chapter of the book of Genesis

26
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,959
that he's purchased by one named Potiphar who was an officer of Pharaoh

27
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,120
captain of the guard and we find as we studied last week in the first six

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,000
verses of our text of Scripture that Joseph

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
we saw him as Joseph the overseer

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,599
and we had the opportunity to be able to study through this portion of Scripture

31
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,879
to be able to understand how God's hand of blessing

32
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,839
was upon Joseph and we understand that that was a direct result

33
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:58,839
of Joseph's behavior of him living a life that was pleasing

34
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:02,480
to the Lord. This evening as we pick it up in verse number seven notice the

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,319
Bible says this and it came to pass

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,759
after these things. Now remember there was a period of time we mentioned

37
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,639
with regard to how long Joseph was there in the house of Potiphar he served

38
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,479
faithfully

39
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,839
it was at least 10 years that he was there serving

40
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:22,720
if you look at the details of dates with regard to events that take place here in

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,679
the book of Genesis

42
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:28,160
and we find that after these things when everything in the house of Potiphar was

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
left into the hands of Joseph

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,960
remember the Bible said at the end of verse number five that the blessing of the Lord was

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,320
upon all that he had in the house and the field

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,240
in verse number six says and he Potiphar left all that he had in Joseph's hand

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,320
and he knew not all he had save the bread which he did eat

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,080
and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored and it came to pass after these

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,320
things verse number seven

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,600
that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,639
and she said lie with me

52
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,479
but thank God for these words in verse number eight

53
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,000
he refused. The Bible says

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,240
and said unto his master's wife behold my master wanteth not what is with me in

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
the house

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,759
and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand

57
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,919
there is none greater in this house than I

58
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,720
neither hath he kept back anything from me

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,039
but thee because thou art his wife

60
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,080
notice this statement how then can I do this great wickedness

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,080
and sin against

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,880
God. It came to pass in verse 10 as she spake to Joseph notice

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,119
day by day that he hearken not unto her to lie by her

64
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,199
or to be with her. It came to pass about this time that Joseph

65
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,479
went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the

66
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,199
house

67
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,039
there within and she caught him by his garment

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,759
saying lie with me and he left his garment

69
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,360
in her hand and fled and got

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,040
him out. We will make note with regard to the text down through verse number 19

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
but this evening

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,440
we see part number two the Lord was with Joseph the

73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,559
particular aspect that we're gonna deal with from this passage this evening last

74
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,959
week we saw Joseph

75
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,079
the overseer tonight we see Joseph

76
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,239
the accused. Joseph the accused

77
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,000
what I'm thankful for as I look at this passage of scripture several things that

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,359
are

79
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,600
of great importance and significance to us as Bible believers

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,119
and understanding the impact of this account

81
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,799
in our lives and how it helps us but as we look at the entirety of Genesis

82
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,880
chapter 39

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,440
next week we'll have a missionary but the following Sunday I'll deal with the

84
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,079
final part of this passage of scripture

85
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,320
and we'll deal with Joseph the prisoner and as we

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,320
kinda look at the entirety of the chapter we look at Joseph the overseer

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Joseph the accused and Joseph the prisoner

88
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,679
what we learn and what we find out is that God is with him

89
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:15,119
in each of those times of his life and that brings great encouragement to me as

90
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,440
a child of God

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,880
because there are times in which circumstances will take place in your

92
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,200
life and in my life

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,959
that are maybe beyond what we would think is our human control

94
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,559
but yet God promises that he'll be with us

95
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,679
as we look at this particular portion of scripture in dealing with the fact that

96
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,399
Joseph

97
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,600
the accused we see in verse number 7 and 10

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
where the temptation is recorded the Bible tells us that she says in verse

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
number 7

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,359
lie with me this is the initial temptation

101
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:50,279
that takes place and we find that the Bible tells us that he refused

102
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,799
but I want you to see that in verse number 10 the Bible tells us

103
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,519
that it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day

104
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,160
by day there was an initial temptation and then there was continued

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
temptation

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,399
and we find that in verse number 12 the final record of this temptation where

107
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,480
she sees

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,079
and decides that she's going to seize the moment

109
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,920
that there's no one else in the house in this final temptation comes when she

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,480
catches him by the garment

111
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,480
and she says lie with me we begin to think about the temptation in looking at

112
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,519
this particular

113
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,760
text of scripture and what's given to us and we understand that as human beings

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,320
we too will be tempted as we

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,160
live this life and the reality this evening as we think about the Lord Jesus

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,320
Christ the Bible tells us in the book of Matthew and again in the book of Luke

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,799
that he was led in the wilderness by the spirit he was tempted

118
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:48,160
of the devil and we find that that temptation came

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,799
to the Lord Jesus Christ and temptation will come in your life it will come in

120
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,079
my life it comes in Joseph's life

121
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,160
and we see the record of this temptation it's interesting

122
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:04,119
as you look at Luke's gospel account the Bible speaks about the devil leaving

123
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:08,399
for a season and that's quite interesting to me because

124
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,480
oftentimes when we face temptation in our lives you may face temptation today

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,320
and you may have victory today but you can rest assured that the enemy is gonna

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,839
come again tomorrow

127
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,000
and he's gonna come next week and he's gonna come the week after that

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,200
and we find that in certain aspects of our life as we've experienced the

129
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
Christian journey

130
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,119
the enemy just tries to beat us

131
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:36,760
down he tries to find that weak moment that time of being vulnerable

132
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,200
if you will and we find that it's so vitally important that we understand

133
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,600
this evening the importance of walking

134
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,760
in the spirit why because God tells us in the book of Galatians

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,880
that if we walk in the spirit we will not fulfill the lust

136
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,079
of the flesh something that is true for each and every one of us this evening is

137
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,000
that even

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,920
if we are born again if we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior we

139
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
still have

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,359
the flesh we still have the old man

141
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,679
and those tendencies of the old man those

142
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:15,239
the fleshly desires and that's why the Bible teaches us in the book of

143
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:18,720
Ephesians and again in the book of Colossians that we're to put off

144
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,839
and then put on and what a great principle that God teaches us

145
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,279
but we see the temptation recorded many of us would be familiar with the truth

146
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,920
the first Corinthians 10

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,039
in verse number 13 turn over there with me and look at this portion of scripture

148
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,119
again you might be able to memorize it but I wanna have us read it this evening

149
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,679
and gather tonight from this portion of scripture

150
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,400
as we look at the life of Joseph but then also make application for

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,880
our own lives notice what Paul says to the believers in Corinth under the

152
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,679
inspiration the Holy Spirit of God

153
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,719
with regard to this truth of being tempted and first Corinthians 10 in

154
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,760
verse 13 notice what the Bible says

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,320
there hath no temptation taken you

156
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,280
but such as is common to man

157
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,640
but I want you to notice those next statement those next words the Bible

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,119
says but God

159
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:17,200
is faithful aren't you thankful that we serve a God who is faithful

160
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,200
and we sang last week we made mention on Wednesday evening about being thankful

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,559
for God's faithfulness

162
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,840
but notice specifically within the context

163
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,679
what Paul highlights with regard to the faithfulness of God

164
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,039
within the subject matter of this temptation

165
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,520
that you will face that I will face the Bible says that God is faithful

166
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,840
who will not suffer you allow you

167
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,080
to be tempted above that you are

168
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,039
able but notice this but will with the temptation

169
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,880
also make a way to escape

170
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,880
that you may be able to bear it I've written in the margin of my Bible

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
two things next to the word

172
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,840
to this verse of scripture, number one, God is faithful.

173
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,200
Number two, look for the escape route.

174
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
Look for the escape route.

175
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,760
Because the Bible tells us that God with the temptation

176
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,920
also he will make a way to escape.

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,520
You know what happens sometimes is unfortunately,

178
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,840
mankind is not looking for the escape route.

179
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,040
In fact, there's too often that mankind is looking

180
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,160
to satisfy the desires of the flesh.

181
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,640
And we find this evening that as we look at Genesis 39

182
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,680
and we look at Joseph the accused,

183
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,800
and we see the temptation recorded,

184
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,480
he was a man that though 1 Corinthians 10, 13

185
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,200
was not written as we have it in the Bible today,

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
we understand that the principle forever,

187
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,640
O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.

188
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
And Joseph was a man that lived and understood.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
Listen, there was an escape route and he got out.

190
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,640
He refused and he got out and what a blessing.

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,480
Notice, as we think about the temptation being recorded,

192
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,840
we look at the response of Joseph.

193
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,240
And it's given to us in three aspects as we look here

194
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
in verse number eight, the Bible says that he refused.

195
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,240
Now I'm thankful for his refusal.

196
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm thankful that he initially as this temptation comes

197
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
and it unfolds in this period of time

198
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,560
in which Joseph has served in the house of Potiphar.

199
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,920
And the Bible simply states he refused.

200
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,240
Praise God for that.

201
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,360
And I'm thankful that he recognized the position

202
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,640
that he had, but more than recognizing the position

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,760
that he had, more than recognizing what Potiphar

204
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
had entrusted him with, because he mentions those things.

205
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
Look in verse number eight, he says,

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,700
behold, my master wanteth not what is with me in the house.

207
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,120
And he had committed all that he hath to my hand.

208
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,040
He understood that his master Potiphar had entrusted him.

209
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
He was Joseph the overseer.

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,240
He was the man that had all of this power and this control,

211
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,200
but he also says there is none greater in this house

212
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
than I in verse number nine.

213
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,320
Neither hath he kept back anything from me, but thee.

214
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
Why?

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,440
Because thou art his wife.

216
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,200
And so Joseph understood, he recognized as he refused

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,840
the request of Potiphar's wife to lie with me,

218
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,920
he recognized the fact that his master had entrusted him

219
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,720
with this great power.

220
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,840
He recognized his position within the home,

221
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
but I want you to understand that those weren't

222
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,740
the most important things that he recognized.

223
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,200
Those are recorded for us, and it's important

224
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,800
that we understand, listen, there are some places

225
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,720
in some circumstances in life where maybe a position

226
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,400
that an individual holds will keep them

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,500
from committing some particular act of sin.

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,340
Why?

229
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,480
Because it would look really bad for that position.

230
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,920
I understand we're living in a time where it seems

231
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,920
as if it's not that bad anymore, and people just kind of,

232
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,600
well, everyone's doing it, and so on and so forth,

233
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,440
but there was a time in our nation's history

234
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,420
where there was some level of respect

235
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,840
with particular offices that people would not,

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,080
because of an office, commit certain things.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,360
But I want you to understand this evening

238
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,920
that just because you recognize an office,

239
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,640
a position that you have, is not the greatest thing.

240
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,360
The greatest thing is what he says

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,840
at the end of verse number nine.

242
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,160
Notice the statement, how then can I do

243
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,000
this great wickedness, and notice what he says,

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,460
and sin against God.

245
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,240
You know what Joseph understood?

246
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,520
He realized the awfulness of sin.

247
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,680
He understood as he was being tempted and he refused,

248
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,400
and he gives this response as it's recorded

249
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,800
in verses eight and nine.

250
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,000
He says, how then can I do this great wickedness

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,520
and sin against God?

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,640
I wonder this evening how mindful we are

253
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,380
when we commit some act of sin,

254
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,000
of recognizing that it's a sin against God.

255
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
Sometimes if we're not careful,

256
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,920
we can kind of sugarcoat our sin,

257
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,480
we can kind of call it, we want to use terminologies

258
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,480
that are not too offensive because we want to make sure

259
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,380
we still feel good about ourselves,

260
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,900
but the reality is that sin is awful,

261
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,900
it's wicked, and it's against God.

262
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,480
And here this evening, as we look at the statement of Joseph

263
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I am just looking at where this is with regard

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,160
to the dialogue within the book of Genesis,

265
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
and thinking about the contrast between Joseph

266
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,480
here in Genesis 39 and Judah in Genesis chapter 38.

267
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,640
Now remember, we studied a few weeks ago

268
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,600
in Genesis chapter number 38, the wickedness of Judah,

269
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,960
and we talked about his private and his public wickedness

270
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,680
and all that was going on and that God knows about,

271
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,040
but Judah was in a position where he thought

272
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,140
that he could kind of get away with this sin.

273
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,280
Judah kind of thought that he was in a position

274
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,000
where he could make decisions and he could have

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,520
that pleasure of sin for a season, if you will,

276
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,060
and that no one's really gonna find out.

277
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,920
But Joseph, on the other hand, says how can I do

278
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,920
this great wickedness and sin against God?

279
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,720
This evening I believe that what we really need

280
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,680
in our churches and our nation is understanding

281
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,560
this truth of the awfulness of sin.

282
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,400
And sin is deceitful.

283
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,860
The Bible talks about in the book of Hebrews

284
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,300
the deceitfulness of sin.

285
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,180
And we find here this evening that Joseph refuses,

286
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,020
he realized the awfulness of sin.

287
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,620
And I want you to look at Hebrews 13, if you will.

288
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,140
Again, hold your place there in Genesis,

289
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,240
we'll be right back, but look over in the book of Hebrews,

290
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,060
if you will, in the 13th chapter.

291
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,680
And I want you to see again, as we have the privilege

292
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,860
of having the whole canon of scripture

293
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,700
and we can look at and we can see the truth

294
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,860
of what God has given us and we can see it illustrated

295
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,020
even here in the life of Joseph,

296
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,020
a man that is living a life that is pleasing

297
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,860
and honoring to the Lord.

298
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,860
In Hebrews chapter 13, so often we'll quote verse five

299
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,960
in verse number six, but I remind you that the Bible says

300
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,220
in verse number four of Hebrews 13,

301
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,900
marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.

302
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,100
But the Bible says that whoremongers and adulterers,

303
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,380
God will judge.

304
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,700
That word that's translated in our King James Bible,

305
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,500
whoremongers is a word that's also translated

306
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,900
in other portions of scripture, a fornicator.

307
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,620
And so we see that here in Hebrews 13 in verse number four,

308
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,200
the truth of fornication and adultery are both exposed

309
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,780
as being evil, wicked, that God will judge.

310
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,220
You know what's sad today?

311
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,060
Fornication and adultery has just become commonplace

312
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,900
in our nation.

313
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,460
Sad.

314
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,980
No doubt if we were to take a survey this evening

315
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,020
of asking this simple question,

316
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,980
do you know someone that has been engaged

317
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,740
in the sin of fornication or adultery?

318
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,120
I would say the majority of us would say,

319
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,920
I know someone that's been involved in that sin.

320
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,760
That's sad.

321
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,060
You know what's even worse?

322
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,580
It's become commonplace in God's house.

323
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,900
It's become commonplace in God's house.

324
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,060
And you say, how could that be?

325
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,940
Because we've forgotten to recognize the awfulness of sin.

326
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,980
We've given our place, we've dealt with

327
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,200
and we've begin to be influenced by a culture,

328
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,300
by a society that says, hey, do what you want,

329
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,900
live how you want and do what makes you happy

330
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,940
and so on and so forth.

331
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,300
And listen, that's a lie from the pit of hell.

332
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,020
This evening, we see that Joseph,

333
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,300
he refused why he recognized,

334
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,980
he realized the awfulness of sin,

335
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,020
but then I want you to see that he ran.

336
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,900
The Bible says that it came to pass in verse number 10

337
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
that she spake to Joseph day by day

338
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,420
and he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, to be with her.

339
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,860
They came to pass about this time

340
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,140
that Joseph went into the house in verse 11

341
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,420
to do his business.

342
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,660
There was none of the men of the house there within.

343
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,860
She seizes the opportunity,

344
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,260
says that she caught him by his garment.

345
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,020
She says, lie with me.

346
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,200
And notice what the Bible says,

347
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,420
that he left his garment in her hand and fled

348
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,380
and got him out.

349
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm thankful for Joseph's response in running.

350
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,179
Some have noted that he lost his coat,

351
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:02,820
but he retained his character.

352
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,940
And that coat that he lost in verse number 12

353
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,679
would cause him some difficulty in the next several verses

354
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,020
with regard to the accusation

355
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,980
that is brought against Joseph by the wife of Potiphar.

356
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,380
But I want you to see that it was far better

357
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,760
for him to lose a coat than to lose his character.

358
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,920
And we find that the Bible says that he fled.

359
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,619
God tells us, Paul writes to Timothy

360
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,739
both in the first and second letters

361
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,660
that he writes to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter six.

362
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,420
And in 2 Timothy chapter number two,

363
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,820
he speaks about fleeing, fleeing youthful lust,

364
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,700
fleeing fornication.

365
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,020
Sometimes we've just got to,

366
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,940
like the Patch the Pirate song says,

367
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,299
put on your running shoes, amen.

368
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,739
And some of you little kids,

369
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:54,340
you know that Patch song, put on your running shoes,

370
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,140
get out, why?

371
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,460
Because God is faithful to provide a way to escape.

372
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,299
1 Corinthians.

373
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,419
10, 13.

374
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:03,279
And sometimes the way to escape

375
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,139
is that you gotta put on your running shoes

376
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,499
and you gotta flee.

377
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:11,499
The Bible says that he fled and got him out.

378
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,579
Praise the Lord.

379
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:18,579
For a man that facing this continued temptation

380
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:23,139
that came day by day and day by day,

381
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,379
that he continued to have that spiritual strength

382
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:30,579
to refuse and to stand for what was right

383
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,679
and to recognize the awfulness of sin.

384
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,059
The Bible tells us as we would again,

385
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,299
contrast his behavior even with others

386
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,259
within the pages of Scripture.

387
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,459
I'm reminded this evening of King David,

388
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:50,659
a man that the Bible says is a man after God's own heart.

389
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,219
A man who when he was to be in battle,

390
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,099
carried in Jerusalem a man that observed Bathsheba

391
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,539
washing herself, bathing herself.

392
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,379
And he says, get her for me.

393
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:12,379
The servant of David says, is not this Bathsheba?

394
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,619
Notice the Bible says the wife of Uriah, the Hittite.

395
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,679
She's a married woman, David.

396
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,379
You know what that was?

397
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:26,659
That was God faithful.

398
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:33,739
Putting up a bright sign of no, David, stop.

399
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:40,579
And David refused and said, get her, bring her to me.

400
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:45,979
Listen, each of us are gonna face temptation in our lives.

401
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,739
You may have faced temptation already today.

402
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,559
You're gonna face temptation tomorrow.

403
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,219
There's something that comes to your mind

404
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,059
as we're looking at this portion of Scripture.

405
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,459
I don't know what the temptation is.

406
00:21:55,459 --> 00:22:00,459
You know how cunning the enemy is?

407
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,339
Is that the temptation in your life

408
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:04,959
is gonna be different than the temptation in the life

409
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,499
of somebody a couple of rows from you

410
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,939
and different than mine and so on and so forth, why?

411
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:13,359
Because the Bible gives us as we look at the truth

412
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,379
of who our God is, but also how our enemy works,

413
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,939
that he's crafty and he's cunning.

414
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,899
And the Bible tells us, look,

415
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,419
he's going to tempt you in areas

416
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,159
where you're most vulnerable.

417
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,819
We can think about using the terminology

418
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,099
where somebody will, maybe they're trying to eat

419
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,899
a little bit more healthy and they'll say,

420
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,619
oh, that doesn't even tempt me

421
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,799
because it's not really the kind of dessert

422
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,259
that they really like.

423
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,579
You've ever heard somebody use that kind of phraseology?

424
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:41,539
And then all of a sudden,

425
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,979
you bring their favorite dessert into the room

426
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,819
and all of a sudden they're tempted, right?

427
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,779
And the fact of the matter is that the dessert

428
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,859
that tempts you might not be the dessert

429
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,699
that tempts me and vice versa.

430
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:56,939
But with sin, it works the same way.

431
00:22:56,939 --> 00:23:00,699
You have certain weaknesses and it's those weaknesses

432
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:03,139
where you have that the enemy is going to try

433
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:08,139
to exploit those and that temptation is going to come.

434
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,819
That's why it's so vitally important

435
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:13,019
that we be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

436
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,299
Put on the whole armor of God.

437
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,379
Why?

438
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,539
Because those fiery darts are gonna come

439
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,019
and we'll be able to quench all the fiery darts

440
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,219
of the wicked.

441
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:27,739
And we find here this evening that he becomes the accused

442
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,899
because of his behavior, because of his refusal.

443
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,919
It says in verse 13, and it came to pass

444
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,979
when she, Potiphar's wife, saw that he had left his garment

445
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:39,899
in her hand and was fled forth that she called

446
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,179
unto the men of the house and spake unto them saying,

447
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:47,179
see, he, speaking of Potiphar, hath brought in in Hebrew,

448
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,099
speaking of Joseph unto us to mock us.

449
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,259
He came in unto me to lie with me

450
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,819
and I cried with a loud voice.

451
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,979
Now, is she telling the truth?

452
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,299
She could not be further from the truth.

453
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,339
That's what she says.

454
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,539
You know, sometimes people are gonna lie about you.

455
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,379
And there's nothing you can do about it.

456
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,059
You know what happens sometimes when people lie about us

457
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,699
and we don't want to defend ourselves.

458
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,259
And I understand that.

459
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,459
But you know, Joseph was in a position

460
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,419
where he wasn't able to defend himself.

461
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:25,379
The Bible says that she gives this story,

462
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:30,699
this lie to the men that came in after she cries.

463
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,819
It says in verse 15, it came to pass when he heard

464
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,419
that I lifted up my voice and cried

465
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:37,739
that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out.

466
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,440
And she laid up his garment by her until his Lord came home.

467
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,199
That's Potiphar and she spake unto him

468
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,720
according to these words saying,

469
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,479
the Hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us

470
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,519
came in unto me to mock me.

471
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,199
Now, if you're the husband,

472
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,799
how do you feel when you hear that?

473
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,199
Yeah, you're enraged?

474
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,720
Yeah, angry?

475
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,559
Guess what?

476
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,479
Potiphar has some power.

477
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:04,000
The Bible tells us that he's an officer of Pharaoh.

478
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,319
He's captain of the guard.

479
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,359
The Bible tells us that he hears this,

480
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,879
which she says in verse 17,

481
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,799
it says that she spake unto him according to these words

482
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,679
saying, the Hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us

483
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,199
came in unto me to mock me.

484
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,879
And it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried

485
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,639
that he left his garment with me and fled out.

486
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:25,159
And it came to pass when his master heard the words

487
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,519
of his wife, which she spake unto him saying,

488
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,799
after this manner did thy servant to me

489
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,039
that his wrath was kindled.

490
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,879
And what does he do?

491
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:37,319
Verse 20, and Joseph's master took him

492
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,079
and put him into the prison,

493
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,159
a place where the king's prisoners were bound.

494
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,319
And he was there in the prison.

495
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,759
Now, as we look at this portion of scripture

496
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,399
and we see what's taking place and Joseph the accused,

497
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,599
we learn some very valuable lessons about temptation

498
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,279
that you will face, that I will face

499
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,079
and how we need to respond to that temptation

500
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,919
because the temptation is gonna come.

501
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,879
And it comes in a variety of forms.

502
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:07,599
There are times you can do a simple internet search

503
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,879
for something extremely innocent that you're looking for.

504
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,919
And all of a sudden things come up on your screen.

505
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,839
Has it happened to you?

506
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,919
Sure it has.

507
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,919
What is going on?

508
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:19,799
What do you do?

509
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,879
How do you respond?

510
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:24,799
What kind of controls do we have in place?

511
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,519
See, sometimes we talk about the importance

512
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,879
and I think we should talk about the importance

513
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,279
of having controls in place for young people

514
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,759
and what have you, but understand temptations don't stop

515
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:38,479
when you turn 18, they don't stop when you turn 30 or 40

516
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:41,199
or 50, they continue to come.

517
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
And it's important that we're accountable

518
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,799
and that we live a life that is pleasing the Lord

519
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
and we learn how to respond to the temptation

520
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,559
that we always are looking for the escape route.

521
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,399
And here in this passage of scripture,

522
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,019
Joseph is falsely accused and he ends up in prison.

523
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,399
But I would submit to you and it will be a continuation

524
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:05,959
to next week as we've looked at this chapter now

525
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,119
in this three part series, I would submit to you

526
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,919
that God is at work in Joseph's life.

527
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,839
God's at work.

528
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,039
There are times in your life and in my life

529
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,239
that there are some circumstances that come in our life

530
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,119
we say, I didn't do anything wrong.

531
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,279
Joseph didn't do anything wrong.

532
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,119
He is faithful.

533
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,720
He responded exactly, I mean, if you want a case study

534
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,959
on exactly how to respond to temptation,

535
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,220
this is your chapter.

536
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,799
Outside of the Lord Jesus Christ, this is your chapter.

537
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,679
And he ends up in prison.

538
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,559
But God was at work.

539
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,199
God was at work.

540
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,079
You know why?

541
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,720
It's through Joseph being in a prison

542
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,919
after being falsely accused that God will bring Joseph

543
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,119
into contact with the butler and the baker

544
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,720
and God's plan will continue to unfold

545
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,959
in the life of Joseph.

546
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,720
And here's the thing, many of us this evening

547
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,440
have read the entire book of Genesis.

548
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,639
Many of us this evening, we know what happens

549
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:12,479
in the life of Joseph.

550
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:15,319
But at this moment in Joseph's life,

551
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,919
he knew that he was falsely accused.

552
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,839
He knew he did nothing wrong and he ends up in prison.

553
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,319
But he continues to serve God.

554
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,119
He continues to be faithful.

555
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,399
And the Bible tells us that when he's in prison,

556
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:30,000
the Lord is with him.

557
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,199
This evening, it's far better,

558
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,440
Peter talks about it, when we suffer for righteousness,

559
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,479
when we, listen, if we do wrong and we suffer for it,

560
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,440
that's on you.

561
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:49,000
But blessed are you, happy are ye

562
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,399
when we suffer for righteousness.

563
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,479
This evening, it's far better to retain your character

564
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,159
and your integrity and live a life that's pleasing

565
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,760
and honoring to the Lord.

566
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,119
That accusation comes, the temptation came,

567
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,399
but Joseph, he's got a testimony that stands

568
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,080
that we look to in the word of God

569
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,159
and we say, look at this man of God.

570
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,159
Look at an example of someone that dealt with temptation

571
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,599
properly biblically and then see what God did in his life.

572
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,279
This evening, Joseph the accused,

573
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,919
listen, you're gonna face temptation.

574
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,880
Sometimes you do the right thing.

575
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,239
You refuse it.

576
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,039
You recognize the evil wickedness of it.

577
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,119
You run and maybe you'll be falsely accused,

578
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,000
but before God, you can retain your integrity,

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,519
your character, and we can thank God

580
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,479
that God, he keeps a good record book.

581
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,719
He knows, and it'd be far better

582
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,679
to be able to stand before him knowing

583
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,000
that we can stand with our integrity and innocency,

584
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,799
that we have looked for that escape route.

585
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,640
Let's pray together.

586
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,479
Father, we love you.

587
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:05,479
Thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word. Thank You for the truth of Your Word.

588
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:15,479
I pray that this evening as we consider the temptation of Joseph and the accusation that's

589
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:19,999
brought against him, Lord, I pray that You'd help us in our lives. No doubt, each and every

590
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:28,999
one of us, we face temptation. God, I pray You'd help us to recognize that You're faithful.

591
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:36,519
God, that You'd help us to look for that escape route. God, thank You that You're a God of

592
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:44,119
grace and mercy, forgiveness. We sang grace that's greater than all of our sin. Maybe

593
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:51,359
there's some that have failed in this area. They've given in to the temptation. They've

594
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:58,439
committed the sin. God, I pray that tonight they would confess it, find forgiveness with

595
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:06,559
Thee. Lord, that they'd have restored fellowship with Thee. Why? Because You're a God who's

596
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,959
ready to pardon, ready to forgive. We have an advocate with the Father, the Lord Jesus

597
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:19,959
Christ. Lord, I pray You'd help each of us, Lord, to walk, live in such a way that we

598
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,679
would please Thee. We'll thank You for what You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.

599
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,519
Would you stand with me?
