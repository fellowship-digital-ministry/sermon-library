1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,519
chapter number 15 this morning and I'll be looking at the last portion of this

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,840
wonderful passage of Scripture be looking at verses 51 through 58 1st

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,720
Corinthians 15 verses 51 through 58 I'm so thankful for the Word of God and

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,360
God's Word has changed my life and I know that many of you would testify this

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,399
day that God's Word has had a profound impact in your life as well and I'm so

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,959
thankful for the truth contained therein I'm thankful that as I go to the Word of

7
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,080
God that God will use his Word to comfort me he'll use his Word to

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,840
convict me and he has no doubt changed me through the truth that is revealed

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,200
to us in his precious book the Bible 1st Corinthians 15 looking at verses 51

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,000
through 58 the Bible says this behold I show you a mystery we shall not all

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,680
sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,400
last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,519
and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,279
this mortal must put on immortality so in this corruptible shall have put on

15
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:21,599
incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,480
to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,639
death where is thy sting Oh grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin

18
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:42,160
the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,959
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be

20
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,120
steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,959
know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I want to draw your attention

22
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,239
to the last phrase of verse number 53 we'll use this for our title this

23
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,960
morning and the last phrase this mortal shall put on immortality if you're

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,039
taking notes simply that phrase this mortal shall put or must put on

25
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,119
immortality as we think about first Corinthians 15 we know that this

26
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:26,000
chapter is known as the resurrection chapter in the Bible in fact as we

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,679
consider the truth of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we

28
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:35,479
would say this morning that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the

29
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,639
cornerstone of our faith we understand this morning that as the people of God

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,759
that we ought to rejoice greatly in this Bible reality that Jesus Christ conquered

31
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,039
sin death in the grave and rose in victory we had the opportunity this

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,679
morning to sing some songs about the incarnation the birth of our Lord and

33
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:01,360
Savior Jesus Christ and we understand that he was born to die that he came to

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,960
this earth with a purpose with a mission if you will and that was to go to the

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,759
cross of Calvary to pay for the sin of mankind and he fulfilled that which his

36
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,839
purpose was and he went to that cruel cross and he bled and he died he was

37
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:21,679
borrowed buried in that borrowed tomb but he rose in victory and as we look at

38
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:26,440
first Corinthians 15 we find that not only should it cause us to rejoice but

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,080
it gives us hope we find that Paul systematically in this passage of

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,320
Scripture teaches the believers in Corinth the truth regarding the

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,800
resurrection and then I believe that as we look at the section that we'll be

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,479
focusing on this morning he challenges these believers to live for the Lord in

43
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:52,559
the present we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 20 but now is Christ

44
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:58,559
risen from the dead notice and become the firstfruits of them that slept in

45
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:05,320
verse 22 the Bible says first in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be

46
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,720
made alive and we find that it causes us to rejoice it gives us hope and

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,399
expectation if you will and what joy that should bring to the heart of every

48
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:20,839
believer as we really fix our attention upon the reality of what God gives us in

49
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,959
this wonderful chapter and really we find that it's throughout the scriptures

50
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,839
but here in one chapter the evidence that is just systematically given with

51
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,480
regard to the the event as it's given with the resurrection and the impact of

52
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,440
that truth on the believers if you're taking notes this morning I just have

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,839
two points for you but that doesn't mean that the service will be any shorter and

54
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,839
sometimes you can have 10 points and it's a kind of a concise thing and

55
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,200
sometimes you can have two points and it's just as long as if you had 10 but

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,720
if you are taking notes number one this morning the certainty of the promise the

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,279
certainty of the promise notice with me in verses 51 through 57 I've read it

58
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,320
already but I want you to take note of some of the verbage that is used some of

59
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,359
the words that God uses in this passage of scripture that reminds us of the

60
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:19,359
certainty of this promise notice in verse number 51 the Bible says behold I

61
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:24,359
show you a mystery notice we shall not all sleep but notice what it says but we

62
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:31,519
shall all be changed I like that shall that's a good Bible word it's not a

63
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,320
think it meant many of us it might happen it could happen no this is a

64
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,399
certainty we shall all be changed notice it says we shall not all sleep in other

65
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,000
words what he's referring to is that not every believer will die prior to the

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,760
rapture of the church as we compare scripture with scripture and we

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,839
understand the truth the first Thessalonians chapter number four the

68
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,359
Bible says but they which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with

69
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:02,880
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and we understand that the we're

70
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,440
not going to prevent them go before those that had died in Christ and here

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,839
as Paul is giving the truth of the believers in Corinth he says we shall

72
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,600
not all sleep not every single believer will die a physical death prior to the

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,079
rapture of the church but know with certainty be assured of this we shall

74
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,440
all be changed he says in verse number 52 as we think about the certainty of

75
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,480
the promise it says in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump Oh

76
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,839
how we eagerly await the trumpet of the Lord the Bible says for the trumpet shall

77
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,760
sound this isn't a hope so kind of an idea of this is just a Christianity a

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,279
Christian doctrine that gives some people some kind of excitement no no this

79
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,119
is a Bible reality a truth of the Word of God that the trumpet shall sound the

80
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:05,200
Bible says and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,880
as you notice how many times in verse number 52 the Bible says shall again the

82
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,679
certainty of this event and the certainty of this promise the Bible says

83
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:20,920
in verse number 53 he now begins to use this word must for this corruptible must

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:28,940
put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality we've used that as our

85
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,119
title this mortal must put on immortality it is it is going to happen

86
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:41,720
it must happen and as we look in verse number 54 it continues so when this

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,679
corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have

88
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:52,359
put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death

89
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:57,640
is swallowed up in victory now notice with me in verses 51 through 53 he's

90
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,359
giving us the certainty of the promise and he's speaking about this event

91
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:05,239
that's going to happen in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last

92
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,399
trump but the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible

93
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,519
and we shall be changed this corruptible must put on incorruption this mortal

94
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,720
must put on immortality then he says this so when this corruptible shall have

95
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,839
put on incorruption when it happens because it's so certain that it's going

96
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,559
to happen why because God has said it this isn't the Apostle Paul just trying

97
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:32,760
to have a rah-rah session with the church in Corinth and trying to get them

98
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,919
emotionally charged no this is the Word of God and the certainty of the promise

99
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,159
is that when this happens notice the impact is going to be brought to pass

100
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,119
that the saying this saying death is swallowed up in victory and then we read

101
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:58,200
verse 55 and 56 Oh death where is thy sting see the sting of death is removed

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,760
because of the promise that we read in verses 51 through 54 notice at the end

103
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,239
of verse number 54 death is swallowed up in victory so then as a believer we find

104
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:16,760
that verse 55 says Oh death where is thy sting because death is swallowed up in

105
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,400
victory why because of the truth of 1st Corinthians 15 the resurrection of Jesus

106
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,320
Christ the the hope of every child of God remember as we studied through the

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,000
book of Hebrews this year in Hebrews chapter number 2 the Word of God gives

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,840
us this precious truth with regard to those that would fear death and the

109
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Bible says in verse number 14 and verse number 15 with regard to this truth and

110
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,359
notice in Hebrews 2 and 4 verse 14 for as much then as the children are

111
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:52,760
partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same

112
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:01,479
that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death

113
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:04,019
That is the devil.

114
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,439
Notice v. 15.

115
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,059
"...and deliver them who through fear of death

116
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,839
were all their lifetime subject to bondage."

117
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,139
But when we understand the certainty

118
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,739
of the promise that is before us

119
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:20,079
in 1 Corinthians 15,

120
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,099
and we look at this latter portion of this chapter,

121
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,019
and we see what is going to happen,

122
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,939
the Bible tells us that death

123
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,759
is swallowed up in victory,

124
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,179
and thus we say,

125
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,419
O death, where is thy staying?

126
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:38,179
O grave, where is thy victory?

127
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,259
I'm thankful that if I am to die

128
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,899
prior to the rapture,

129
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,679
that I will be buried in some tomb somewhere,

130
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,059
but that's not the end of the story.

131
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,059
Amen?

132
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,899
I know how D.L. Moody used to say

133
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,259
that one day you're going to read in the papers

134
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,979
that D.L. Moody has died.

135
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:57,259
Don't believe it.

136
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,779
Don't believe it for a moment

137
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,099
because on that day,

138
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,719
I'll be more alive than I ever have been.

139
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,719
Yesterday, a great hero of the faith,

140
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,439
Dr. Henry Morris III,

141
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,159
went home to be with the Lord.

142
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,079
But here's the amazing thing.

143
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,959
Though he served and had such an impact

144
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,199
upon Christianity in our generation,

145
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,119
and he fought and contended

146
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,079
for the truth of God's Word

147
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,239
with regard to the Genesis account

148
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,919
and the truth of creation,

149
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:31,339
that today, he's in the presence of his Savior.

150
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:32,179
Why?

151
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,139
Because he took his final breath yesterday,

152
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,699
and then he went to be with his Savior.

153
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,219
O death, where is thy victory?

154
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,819
O, excuse me, thy sting.

155
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,319
O grave, where is thy victory?

156
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,339
Notice what it says in verse 56.

157
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,339
The sting of death is sin.

158
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,299
Why is that?

159
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,839
Because the Bible says the wage of sin is death.

160
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,079
Remember in Genesis chapter number three,

161
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,659
prior to Genesis chapter number three

162
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,239
and in the third chapter of Genesis,

163
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,799
we read of the fall of man,

164
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,479
and we find that prior to that,

165
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,959
that God in chapter number two

166
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,759
gave instruction to Adam

167
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,459
with regard to the fruit of the tree

168
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,119
that they could not partake of.

169
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,239
He said that in the day that thou eat thereof,

170
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,619
thou shalt surely die.

171
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,999
What did the enemy say?

172
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,279
Thou shalt not surely die.

173
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,559
He lies to him.

174
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,519
He says in Genesis chapter number three,

175
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,159
yea, hath God said.

176
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,439
And then he says, ye shall not surely die.

177
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,719
Well, the Bible tells us that

178
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,339
that's when death entered into the world.

179
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:28,759
In Romans chapter number five,

180
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,659
you can read the portion of Scripture

181
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,259
as by one man, that's speaking of Adam,

182
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,099
sin entered into the world,

183
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,579
and death by sin.

184
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,939
And so here as we read verse number 56,

185
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,539
the sting of death is sin.

186
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:45,619
The reality is that we have death in the world today

187
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:46,859
because of sin.

188
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:47,979
That's the result.

189
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,419
That's the consequence of a decision

190
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,579
that was made in Genesis chapter number three

191
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:56,599
to disobey the single command of God.

192
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,919
And we have people today that say,

193
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,359
why would a loving God allow these things to happen?

194
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:05,079
Why is it that people die and all of these things,

195
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,459
disease and all that we deal with?

196
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,839
The reality is it's a consequence of sin.

197
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,799
Death is the result of sin.

198
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,899
We understand that.

199
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,399
The wages of sin is death.

200
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,519
Now we understand that there's a physical death

201
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,079
and there's also a spiritual death.

202
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,739
The Bible refers to the spiritual death

203
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,419
as the second death.

204
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,159
Now I'm thankful that as a child of God,

205
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,339
that the Bible also speaks about birth

206
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,819
and being born again.

207
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,339
There's a physical birth,

208
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,539
but there's also a spiritual birth.

209
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:38,259
And one person said this, a theologian of yesteryear,

210
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,419
to be born once is to die twice.

211
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,739
But to be born twice is to die once.

212
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,979
What do you mean by that?

213
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,699
Well, if you're only born once physically,

214
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:47,739
you're gonna die twice.

215
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,319
You're gonna die a physical death,

216
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,139
but then you're gonna die a spiritual death

217
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,739
because the Bible says that the wages of sin is death.

218
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:58,699
And we understand in Hebrews chapter number nine

219
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:00,299
that the Bible teaches us,

220
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,139
as it appointed unto man once to die,

221
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,779
and after this, the judgment.

222
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,659
And the Bible speaks about the second death.

223
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,859
You can read in Revelation chapter 20

224
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,099
and chapter number 21,

225
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,099
and you read about the second death.

226
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,539
But you also understand on the flip side of that,

227
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,739
to be born twice is to die once.

228
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,399
I was born physically.

229
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,039
I have a physical birthday, just as each of you do.

230
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,959
I was born physically on the 15th of July in the year 1980,

231
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,679
and that was my physical birth date.

232
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,599
Then I was born again on August 31st, 1997.

233
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:41,119
And the Bible says that those of us that have been born again

234
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:45,559
that the second death has no power over us.

235
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,619
To be born twice is to die once.

236
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,339
I'll die a physical death,

237
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,139
but I'm not gonna die a spiritual death.

238
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,459
I'm gonna live forevermore with my Savior.

239
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,339
What a wonderful truth of the word of God.

240
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,939
And we find that, yes, here in the passage,

241
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,739
it says the strength of sin is the law.

242
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:04,139
Remember, Paul says,

243
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,259
I had not known sin if it were not for the law,

244
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,539
because the law told me thou shalt not covet,

245
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,499
and therefore I knew that I was sinning

246
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,859
because I was coveting, Romans chapter number seven.

247
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:17,099
And you can find throughout the word of God

248
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:21,159
that this saying that he's referring to

249
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,199
because of this promise, the certainty of this promise,

250
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:26,959
the reality of what's going to happen,

251
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,479
but again, verse number 54,

252
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,199
bring it all back into context.

253
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,119
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,

254
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,819
again, it's going to happen,

255
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,159
and this mortal shall have put on immortality,

256
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,879
then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,

257
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,479
death is swallowed up in victory.

258
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,719
And then we read verse number 57,

259
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,279
but thanks be to God,

260
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,679
which giveth us the victory

261
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,179
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

262
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,079
See, He went first.

263
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,219
He is the firstfruits.

264
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,079
When we talk about the resurrection,

265
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,039
as we referenced in verse number 20,

266
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,219
again in verse number 23 of this great chapter,

267
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,619
and we find that we can thank God

268
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,419
for the victory that He has given us

269
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,139
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

270
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,499
Now when I think about the certainty

271
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,019
of this promise this morning,

272
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,379
I would say this,

273
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,819
the promise encourages my heart.

274
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,139
I hope it encourages you this morning

275
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,539
when you consider the promise that is before us

276
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,659
in verses 51 through 57,

277
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,059
and you begin to think about heaven,

278
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:32,339
what a joy it is when we have the opportunity

279
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,699
to speak about the reality and the certainty of heaven,

280
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,059
and man, it encourages us.

281
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,339
Miss Joyce comes in here so often

282
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:41,819
and speaks about heaven.

283
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,099
When I see my Savior,

284
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:47,499
and she speaks in terms of just great encouragement,

285
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:48,779
not only the encouragement,

286
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,979
but the joy and the peace

287
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:54,939
that this promise brings in the life of the believer.

288
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:55,879
I would say this,

289
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,979
the promise influences my expectations.

290
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:01,779
I mean, I have an expectation

291
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,039
that one day, one glorious day,

292
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,539
I'm gonna see my Savior face to face.

293
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,939
This life is not all there is.

294
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,219
We're here right now,

295
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:13,699
but remember, we're pilgrims and we're strangers.

296
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,419
We're just a passing through.

297
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,699
This world is not my home.

298
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,579
Praise the Lord.

299
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,739
I believe this morning,

300
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,939
when we think about this promise,

301
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,419
I would say this morning without hesitation,

302
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,939
without doubt,

303
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,459
that this promise that is before us

304
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:35,779
has influenced believers through the centuries.

305
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,099
Many have found great encouragement,

306
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,579
joy, and peace through the promise

307
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,339
of what we're looking at this morning.

308
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,059
Of course, we could look at a number

309
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,579
of additional portions of Scripture

310
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,359
and compare Scripture with Scripture,

311
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,439
but we find this morning

312
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,579
that these believers throughout the centuries

313
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:59,219
have been greatly influenced by this promise.

314
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,699
I want you to think about what Paul said.

315
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,799
Of course, God used Paul to write 1 Corinthians 15,

316
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,579
but I want you to consider a few portions of Scripture

317
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,019
and consider how this promise,

318
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,819
the certainty of this promise,

319
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,379
influenced the Apostle Paul.

320
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:14,619
Look over, keep your place there in 1 Corinthians 15.

321
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,819
We'll be back in a moment.

322
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,299
Look over at 2 Corinthians 5.

323
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:21,859
2 Corinthians 5.

324
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,939
I want you to, we'll pick it up in context.

325
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,579
I wish we could look at the entirety

326
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:29,619
of 2 Corinthians 5.

327
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:32,059
What a powerful passage of Scripture.

328
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,500
The Bible says in verse number five,

329
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,380
now he that hath wrought us for the self,

330
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,139
same thing as God,

331
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,979
who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

332
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,699
That's the proof of our redemption.

333
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:46,339
You can compare that with Ephesians 1,

334
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,739
verses 12 through 14,

335
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:49,339
and the truth of God's Word,

336
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,459
the moment of salvation,

337
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:54,419
the Holy Spirit of God indwells every believer of God,

338
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,679
and what a blessing that is.

339
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,099
Verse six, therefore, we are always confident,

340
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,419
knowing that whilst we are at home in the body,

341
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,859
we are absent from the Lord.

342
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,459
Notice what he says in verse number seven,

343
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,419
and keep this thought for our final point this morning.

344
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,299
He says we walk by faith, not by sight.

345
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,659
Verse eight, we are confident, I say, and willing,

346
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:19,539
rather to be absent from the body

347
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,539
and to be present with the Lord.

348
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,099
Do you think Paul understood the certainty of the promise?

349
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,019
Sure he did.

350
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,459
Do you think Paul was encouraged?

351
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,739
Do you think he was influenced

352
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,299
by the certainty of the promise?

353
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,019
Remember as he's writing to the church in Thessalonica,

354
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,299
as he's giving them word with regard

355
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,299
to the coming of the Lord,

356
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,979
he says, I'm not sharing my opinion,

357
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,459
I'm not sharing my perspective,

358
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,459
I'm giving you the Word of the Lord.

359
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,299
He finishes that passage by saying,

360
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,859
comfort one another with these things.

361
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,779
And what comfort it brings in our hearts,

362
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,419
notice in the book of Philippians, if you will,

363
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,699
in Philippians chapter number one,

364
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,299
Paul is, of course, privileged of God

365
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,859
to minister in the city of Philippi.

366
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,019
He's now writing back to these believers

367
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,940
that he had the opportunity to do so.

368
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,560
opportunity during his second missionary journey to lead to Christ and influence

369
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,980
greatly and he's speaking about the current crisis in his life but he's

370
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,940
helping them understand that these things that have happened unto him have

371
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,260
happened under the furtherance of the gospel what a great perspective by the

372
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,020
way and as he's speaking to them in this first chapter I want to draw your

373
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,060
attention to what he says in verse number 23 he says for I'm in a straight

374
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:41,060
betwixt two what was it that had this man of God in this complex a situation

375
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,220
he says I'm in a straight betwixt two sometimes we're in that position maybe

376
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,700
there's a decision before us and we say man I don't know what to do well let me

377
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,820
reveal to you as you probably already know what it was that caused this

378
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,620
conflict for the Apostle Paul why he would say that he's in a straight

379
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:07,020
betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far

380
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,500
better and this promise that we're looking at this morning that this mortal

381
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,940
must put on immortality this had a profound impact in the life of the

382
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,740
Apostle Paul he says I'm in a straight betwixt two what's wrong Paul what's

383
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,260
going on in your life well I have a desire to depart to be with Christ which

384
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,940
is far better notice what he says nevertheless to abide in the flesh is

385
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,620
more needful for you you know what he understood he understood that the what

386
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,180
the wise man in the Old Testament Solomon recognized there's a time to be

387
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,580
born and there's a time to die and what he recognized is that God the giver and

388
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,660
taker of life was not ready for Paul to go to be with Christ why because there

389
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,300
was still ministry to be done here upon this earth and he says nevertheless to

390
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,740
abide in the flesh is more needful for you God was still using the Apostle Paul

391
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,620
not only to minister broadly and to minister where he was and he reached

392
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,380
people with the gospel in Rome as he was in prison we understand that as we read

393
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,020
the the entirety of this book but we understand that he would be used of God

394
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,100
to pen this book to influence these believers so he says listen I have a

395
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,820
desire to go and be with Christ to be with my Savior which is far better but

396
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,940
God's not done with me here it's more needful for you that that I abide in the

397
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,260
flesh and he understood God's work and God's plan notice with me in 2nd

398
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,820
Timothy chapter number four as we kind of take a quick survey if you will

399
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,619
through the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul and think about the

400
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,699
ministry that God had given him in the way in which the promise that is before

401
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:00,100
us had influenced his life and had brought him encouragement had given him

402
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,979
an expectation had brought joy and peace within his life he's writing to his son

403
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:08,580
in the faith here in 2nd Timothy chapter number four and he says this in verse

404
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,979
number six for I am now ready to be offered I would argue with you that he

405
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:18,220
was ready in Philippians 1 he says I have a desire to depart he was ready but

406
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,660
it wasn't time notice now what it says and the time of my departure is at hand

407
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,820
God had revealed that now Paul would leave this temporal life this earth and

408
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,220
he would go to his long home as Ecclesiastes say he would enter into

409
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,360
eternity he says this in verse number seven I have fought a good fight I have

410
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,619
finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a

411
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,779
crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at

412
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:59,460
that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing as we

413
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,460
think about the Apostle Paul penning these words to the church in Corinth

414
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,820
back in first Corinthians 15 the passage in which we're studying this morning as

415
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,740
we consider God using this man to pen these words and understanding the

416
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,059
influence that he would have upon the believers in Corinth broadly speaking

417
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,660
believers throughout the centuries because of the fact that it is

418
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:26,140
preserved Word of God and the influence and impact in my life today I'm mindful

419
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,140
of some of the things that Paul says later on past first Corinthians 15

420
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,380
remember in 2nd Corinthians chapter number five he said that we walk by

421
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,700
faith not by sight why because we're still in this tabernacle we're still in

422
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,820
this flesh he says here in verse number seven I have fought a good fight I have

423
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,940
finished my course I have kept the faith why what is he referring to he's

424
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,860
referring to his life his journey with Christ if we could tie all of this in

425
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,660
with the book of Hebrews our study throughout 2020 we would say that the

426
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,899
challenge to the believers that were being addressed in the book of Hebrews

427
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:07,100
those first century believers was to continue don't return don't go back to

428
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,739
Judaism why Christ is superior Christ is better and you need to continue and

429
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:16,820
there's a charge that is given to those individuals remember in Hebrews chapter

430
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,100
number six he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let

431
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,339
us go on unto perfection we're mindful in chapter number ten that the just

432
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,860
shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in

433
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,660
him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe

434
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,459
to the saving of the soul we read through Hebrews chapter number 11 that

435
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:43,700
great hall of faith chapter and we read of those that went before us that were

436
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,420
faithful that that ran their race that finished their course and we find that

437
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,420
he's speaking of all those individuals and then we find that he begins chapter

438
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,700
number 12 by saying now let us lay aside every weight and the sin which

439
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,779
doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is

440
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:09,420
before us so we think about the certainty of the promise and how it

441
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,860
causes us to rejoice I want you to think about our conduct in the present our

442
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,019
conduct in the present I'm so thankful for the certainty of the promise I mean

443
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,820
honestly this morning the reality and the certainty of heaven thrills my soul

444
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,779
when we sing about those great hymns of the faith when we see Jesus when we see

445
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:38,260
him face-to-face and when we all get to heaven and all of those wonderful hymns

446
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:46,019
that we sing about heaven and it thrills my soul but I understand that that

447
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:52,059
promise is certain but there's a present and I understand this morning

448
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:58,220
that as I rejoice in the certainty of the promise that I must also understand

449
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:05,540
my conduct in the present how does this truth that has been laid before us

450
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,820
that's been given to these believers in Corinth what is the application as we

451
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,899
come to verse number 58 we find that it begins with a therefore he says therefore

452
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:22,980
my beloved brethren he's gonna give them this application if you will the impact

453
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,779
of this truth in the lives of these people this morning life should truth

454
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,459
should impact your life the Bible tells us that were to be doers of the word not

455
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:39,339
hearers only we find that we at times have had that little chorus that we

456
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:43,480
would sing I'll say yes Lord yes to your will into your way why because

457
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,540
God's Word is to influence my conduct in the present I'm thankful for the

458
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:55,019
certainty of the promise but what about my conduct in the present as we begin to

459
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,119
dissect a very familiar verse of Scripture in verse number 58 and we

460
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,179
begin to see what Paul is saying and we compare that with what Paul said of

461
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,220
himself in in 2nd Corinthians 5 and also over there in Philippians 1 and in

462
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,540
2nd Timothy chapter number 4 I believe that this is impactful for us today

463
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:24,220
notice what he says therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always

464
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,059
abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not

465
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:41,419
vain in the Lord believer child of God there's a certain promise of eternity

466
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:49,220
that this mortal shall put on immortality but until that day serve God

467
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,820
until that day live for him see we find that he says be steadfast and unmovable

468
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,220
really those two words kind of carry the similar idea of being firm of being

469
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,220
settled of not wavering he says this always abounding notice where he says in

470
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:14,099
the work of the Lord we're engaged in the work our conduct in the present

471
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,859
we're engaged in the work we're look notice when he says always abounding I

472
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:27,419
like the imagery that we see in that verse of Scripture that God is blessing

473
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,460
the work we understand the truth of what Paul would say earlier to these

474
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,700
very believers in the church in Corinth with regard to the ministry in the

475
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,380
gospel that some plant and some water but God giveth the increase that we are

476
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,539
laborers together with the Lord and we find that he says always abounding in

477
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:52,580
the work of the Lord notice where he says for as much as you know now the the

478
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:00,580
Word of God in so many various places gives us the the certainty of what God

479
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,900
wants us to know he doesn't want us to be

480
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,820
to be ignorant of things.

481
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,700
He wants us to know some things.

482
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,160
And he says this within the context

483
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,560
of what we're dealing with.

484
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,840
For as much as you know,

485
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,180
notice that your labor, again,

486
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,840
he said that we're always abounding

487
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,000
in the work of the Lord.

488
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,440
We're engaged in God's work.

489
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,800
He says, for as much as you know,

490
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,840
that your labor is not in vain

491
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
in the Lord.

492
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,480
What a great truth.

493
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,360
What a great perspective.

494
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,360
What a great reminder for these believers

495
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,040
with regard to the conduct in the present.

496
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,000
What is my conduct?

497
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,480
What is it that I'm supposed to be doing?

498
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Listen, we're not just going and finding

499
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,640
some sort of cave to hide in

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,960
until Jesus comes.

501
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,920
No, we're to be engaged in the work of the Lord.

502
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,200
Onward, forward, Christian soldier.

503
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
I mean, we march by faith.

504
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,000
The Bible tells us that with regard to the church,

505
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
and I'm so thankful that the church

506
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,320
is not man's idea.

507
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,440
You understand that the church is God's idea.

508
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,360
And Jesus Christ Himself said,

509
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,960
I will build My church

510
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,760
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

511
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,840
It's not that we're in some kind of defensive position.

512
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,200
We're to be on the offense.

513
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,360
We're to be going onward and forward in faith.

514
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,480
Faith is the victory.

515
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,920
1 John 5.

516
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,040
And we find that He says,

517
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,120
as you would consider with me this morning,

518
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,960
our conduct in the present.

519
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,800
Here are some things.

520
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Listen, be certain of the promise.

521
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Allow the promise of the mortal

522
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
putting on the immortality

523
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
to encourage you and to influence you

524
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,400
and to give you those heavenly expectations

525
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,040
and to bring you that joy

526
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
and to give you that peace.

527
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,840
But understand that in the present,

528
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,040
it should have an impact on you.

529
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,320
You know this morning,

530
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,080
there are some things that I can do today

531
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,400
that I can't do when this promise is fulfilled.

532
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,000
When this mortal shall put on immortality,

533
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,360
there are things that I no longer will be able to do.

534
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,280
And such is the case for you.

535
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,480
There are just things you won't be able to do.

536
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,120
There's a whole lot of things you won't be able to do.

537
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,560
And I'm not going to give you an exhaustive list.

538
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,040
I'm obviously not going to deal with the sinful things

539
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,160
that you won't be able to do anymore.

540
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,240
But I want to speak to you about a few things.

541
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
I want to give you a challenge as we conclude this morning

542
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,560
to really consider,

543
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,240
yes, the certainty of the promise,

544
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,560
this mortal must put on immortality.

545
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,760
It's going to happen.

546
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
But until then,

547
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,280
there are some things that I can do.

548
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,080
Shall I say there are some things I must do

549
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,040
that I cannot do later?

550
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,360
When this promise is fulfilled,

551
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,520
I no longer will have the opportunity.

552
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,760
With that thought in mind,

553
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,640
I want to share with you a verse of Scripture

554
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,080
before I give you three areas

555
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,680
in which I would like to draw your attention to.

556
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,360
And that truth is in the book of Galatians.

557
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,480
In Galatians 6,

558
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,600
the Word of God gives us

559
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,800
a powerful truth

560
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,720
that is so pertinent to the subject

561
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,800
in which we're dealing with this morning.

562
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,280
In v. 10,

563
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,960
we will deal with this passage this evening as well.

564
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,080
But we'll be looking at v. 7-9.

565
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,440
But in v. 10 of Galatians 6,

566
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,000
the Bible says this,

567
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,480
as we have therefore opportunity.

568
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,240
You know that you have opportunities today

569
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,800
that you will not have in glory.

570
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,880
It's just the way it is.

571
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,240
As we have therefore opportunity,

572
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,920
let us do good unto all men,

573
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,840
especially unto them

574
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,600
who are of the household of faith.

575
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,080
And so we understand contextually

576
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,480
what he's dealing with

577
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,080
with regard to their interactions

578
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,120
with one another.

579
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,400
He deals with that really

580
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
in the first five verses of chapter 6

581
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
and really bearing one another's burdens

582
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
and so on and so forth.

583
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,920
And we see about this truth in v. 10.

584
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
But I want you to focus upon the thought

585
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
in the beginning of the verse of Scripture

586
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,240
as we have therefore opportunity.

587
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,200
You have opportunity today

588
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,880
that you might not have tomorrow.

589
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,720
We understand that our opportunities

590
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,760
change every day,

591
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,520
but I'm speaking in light of the promise

592
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,400
of the mortal shall put on immortality.

593
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,880
There are things that you can do

594
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,000
as a believer on this earth

595
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,120
that you cannot do when you're in heaven.

596
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,480
Number one, live by faith.

597
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,120
Live by faith.

598
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,360
What did Paul say in 2 Corinthians 5?

599
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,960
We mentioned it a moment ago

600
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
as we looked at that portion

601
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,320
and we spoke about the fact that he says

602
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,760
to be absent from the body

603
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
is to be present with the Lord.

604
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,480
But in v. 7 of chapter 5,

605
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
in the book of 2 Corinthians,

606
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
he says, for we walk by faith,

607
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
not by sight.

608
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,960
The just shall live by faith.

609
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,240
We understand the call upon the people of God

610
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
to live by faith.

611
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,960
But you understand

612
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,000
that you can only live by faith now.

613
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,640
Because when this mortal

614
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,840
shall put on immortality,

615
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,600
then we shall see Him.

616
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
And that's a glorious truth.

617
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,160
I mean, it's a wonderful promise.

618
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,520
I mean, we spoke about the certainty of the promise

619
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,360
in the beginning of our message this morning

620
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,720
and how it encourages us

621
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,920
and how it brings us joy and peace

622
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,480
and what blessing that is.

623
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,000
But you understand today

624
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,840
that we're to live by faith.

625
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,640
Then we shall see Him.

626
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,960
It's no longer going to be living by faith.

627
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,800
And so what opportunity do we have to live by faith?

628
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
Only while we're still in this body.

629
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,000
While we still have this earthly tabernacle.

630
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,160
Because when this mortal

631
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,280
shall put on immortality,

632
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,240
no longer will I be able to live by faith.

633
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,160
You know that it pleases God when we live by faith.

634
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
We understand that.

635
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Hebrews 11 and verse 6.

636
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,040
But without faith,

637
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,720
it is impossible to please Him.

638
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,680
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is,

639
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
and that He is a rewarder of them

640
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,400
that diligently seek Him.

641
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,160
God is pleased when His people live by faith.

642
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,720
But as we consider the promise this morning

643
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,320
and then we consider our conduct in the present.

644
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,360
See, Paul says this is going to be the future.

645
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
This is going to happen.

646
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,680
This is a certain promise.

647
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,280
But now let's talk about your conduct in the present.

648
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,680
Because we're not with Jesus yet.

649
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm glad one day I'm going to be with Him.

650
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,600
And if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

651
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,800
you're going to be with Him too.

652
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
But what's our conduct in the present?

653
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,080
Are we living by faith?

654
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
Are we believing God?

655
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
Are we trusting God?

656
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Are we taking Him at His Word?

657
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Are we proving Him by living by faith?

658
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,680
Or are we faithless?

659
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,480
The reality is that the Word of God speaks

660
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,240
in this manner with regard to faith.

661
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,680
Shall the Son of Man find faith upon the earth?

662
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,840
Speaking about His return.

663
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,200
See, He speaks about the great faith that He saw

664
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,840
of those that He interacted with,

665
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,200
the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry.

666
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,160
But there were times in which He even said to the disciples,

667
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,480
how is it that you have no faith?

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,960
Right?

669
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,160
Where's your faith?

670
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,360
You saw all these things,

671
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
you experienced all these things,

672
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,000
and now where's your faith?

673
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,520
See, I can only live by faith today

674
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,560
when I have this earthly tabernacle.

675
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,800
This mortal shall put on immortality.

676
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,360
And then, I shall see Him.

677
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,000
And I will not be able to live by faith.

678
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Number two, share the Gospel.

679
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Share the Gospel.

680
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
We understand this morning that as the people of God,

681
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,520
we've been commissioned by God Almighty

682
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,800
to preach the Gospel.

683
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,160
The authority of God Himself.

684
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,440
In Matthew 28, all power is given unto Me

685
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,000
in heaven and earth.

686
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,160
And then He says to go and to preach the Gospel.

687
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,200
We understand that each Gospel book,

688
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,640
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

689
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,920
each Gospel record, including the book of Acts,

690
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
give us the commission of God Almighty

691
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,760
to preach the Gospel.

692
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,080
Go ye into all the world

693
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,400
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

694
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
Paul said, woe is unto me

695
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,160
if I preach not the Gospel.

696
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
I wonder this morning,

697
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,200
with what level of enthusiasm do we have

698
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,680
to obey the Word of God?

699
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
God Almighty.

700
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,240
With regard to sharing the Gospel.

701
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,559
See, when this mortal shall put on immortality,

702
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:31,600
then, those that we will be with will know Him.

703
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,480
You're not going to walk the streets of glory

704
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,920
and share the Gospel.

705
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,320
Why?

706
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,520
Because death and hell will be cast in a lake of fire.

707
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,440
The Bible tells us that the only ones

708
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
that will enter into heaven

709
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,000
are those that have been saved,

710
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,480
that have been washed in the blood of the Lamb.

711
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,920
So there's now no need then,

712
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,080
when this mortal shall put on immortality,

713
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,480
I don't need to share the Gospel with anyone.

714
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,880
Because they're all saved people.

715
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,440
Amen?

716
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
So now.

717
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,520
the time to share the gospel. Now is the time to obey the command, the commission.

718
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:19,720
Why? Because this mortal shall put on, must put on, immortality. It's going to

719
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,640
happen. And by the way, you don't know when it's gonna happen, and I don't know

720
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,040
when it's gonna happen. But the truth and the certainty of the promise that

721
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,680
excites us, that encourages us, Paul says, therefore, based upon this truth, let me

722
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,240
talk to you about right now. Let me talk to you about your conduct in the present.

723
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,720
Let me talk to you about your service for God. That's going to happen. The

724
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,520
mortal will put on immortality. The corruption will put on incorruption. But

725
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:57,400
until then, what are you doing for God? How are you serving Christ? Number one,

726
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:05,560
live by faith. Number two, share the gospel. Number three, give to the Lord.

727
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,200
What do I mean when I speak about giving to the Lord? Well, treasure is in there,

728
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,600
but that's the third thought. Number one, give them your time. You know, time

729
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,680
will be no more. You can't give of your time when you're in heaven. I mean, you

730
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,080
can't give them your talents. You can't give them your treasures. And the

731
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,240
reality is that while I'm here, while this mortal is still mortal, while I

732
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,560
still am breathing and living, while I still have this earthly tabernacle, I can

733
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,440
give to the Lord. I can give of my time. I can give of my talents. I can give of my

734
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,360
treasure. But there's coming a day when this mortal shall put on immortality, and

735
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm not going to be able to give of my time or my talents or my treasures. And

736
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,440
so we understand this morning that this is a great truth of the Word of God, the

737
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,600
promise of His, the certainty of His promise, and we think about the way in

738
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,959
which it encourages us as the people of God. But what about our conduct in the

739
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:14,520
present? There are some things that you can do. There are some things that I can

740
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,760
do, that I have opportunity to do, that I can only do while I'm here on earth. I

741
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,080
can't do it when I get to heaven. You know, it's interesting, the wise man says,

742
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I wasn't gonna read this, but I feel that it's appropriate to do so. Look at what

743
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,760
the wise man says in Ecclesiastes 2. It wasn't that I wasn't gonna read it

744
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,160
because it didn't fit or whatever. I just didn't know that we'd have time to go

745
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,199
here. But notice what Solomon says in Ecclesiastes chapter number 2. Of course,

746
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,600
we understand that he's looking at earth, he's looking at life, this side of

747
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,960
eternity, and the vanity of vanities, and so on and so forth. But I want you to

748
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,800
consider this thought. In Ecclesiastes chapter number 2, in verse number 17

749
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,880
through 19, this is, therefore I hated life, because the work that is wrought

750
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,839
under the sun is grievous unto me, for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

751
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,639
Notice what he says in verse 18. Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken

752
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,720
under the sun. Why? Because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

753
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,639
What's he saying? I can't do anything with it after I die. Notice verse number

754
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:22,680
19. And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he have

755
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,040
rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed

756
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,520
myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. You know, Solomon understood

757
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,479
something. There's a time to be born, a time to die. He's gonna mention that in

758
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:40,639
chapter number 3. But even prior to that, he's noticing, listen, life under

759
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,800
the sun, life on this side of eternity, I'm gonna die one day and I

760
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,279
have no control over those things. There's no more that I can do with that.

761
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:55,080
I think about the nation of Israel. We understand that in the book of Malachi,

762
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,760
they're under a great indictment for many things that they're doing. Turn to

763
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,559
the book of Malachi, if you will. I want you to think about this truth that God

764
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,160
has given with regard to the responsibility that we have to give

765
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,839
unto the Lord. We have the opportunity to give, yes, of our time and our talents and

766
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,920
our treasures. And we think about the privilege that is ours. Listen, giving is

767
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,320
part of worship. When we fail to give, not only are we robbing God, but we're not

768
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,519
worshiping Him in the way in which He is worthy to be

769
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,360
worshiped. Can I share something with you this morning? God doesn't need

770
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:43,279
your money. He doesn't need my money. But in God's wisdom and in His design, He

771
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:52,920
said, give. Give and it shall be given unto you. See, He set forth this

772
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,959
principle, this walking by faith, this believing God and giving. Notice in

773
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:04,720
verse number 7 of Malachi chapter number 3, even from the days of your

774
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,799
fathers you're gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them.

775
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:14,559
Return unto me and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said,

776
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:24,279
wherein shall we return? Notice verse 8. Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me.

777
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:34,360
But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? God says in tithes and offerings. Can I

778
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,600
tell you this morning with all sincerity, I'd never want to be accused of robbing

779
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:47,839
God. Wow. And I hope this morning that you would not in any way shape or form want

780
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,600
to be accused. Let me say this, they weren't just accused of it, they were

781
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,559
guilty of it, of robbing God. I don't want to rob any man, but I especially

782
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:05,880
don't want to rob God. He says, you've robbed God. Ye say, wherein have we robbed

783
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,959
thee? God says in tithes and offerings. Why? Because God knows everything. God

784
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:18,799
knows. It says, you're accursed with a curse for you have robbed me. Even this

785
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:26,519
whole nation. Wow. So not only were they guilty of robbing God, but now they're

786
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:34,000
cursed with a curse. That's pretty serious. So what's the remedy? Verse 10.

787
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,760
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in

788
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,160
mine house. Notice what he says, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,

789
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,000
if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that

790
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,440
there shall not be room enough to receive it. Now in my mind, and maybe

791
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,440
you're different than I am, but I seek to, as we look at Psalm 119, I like to think

792
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,959
and act biblically. I don't do it all the time, but I try to immerse myself

793
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,720
so much in the Word of God that I just think biblically. Again, I'm not

794
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,320
there, I haven't arrived, but I love God's Word and I want God's Word in me. And when

795
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,040
I read this verse of Scripture, in verse number 10, when he speaks about, if I will

796
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,559
not open the windows of heaven, immediately my mind goes back to the

797
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:26,000
life and ministry of Elisha, when he talks about the the famine in the land

798
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,279
and he tells them, hey there's gonna be meat, there's gonna be plenty, there's

799
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:34,040
gonna be grain, and so on and so forth. And the man, the officer at the

800
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,000
gate, he says, might this thing be if God were to open the windows of heaven? And

801
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,760
Elisha says, you're gonna see it and hear of it, but you're not gonna partake of it.

802
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,959
You remember those leprous men? They go out there, they're in that quandary. I

803
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:53,080
mean, if we stay here, we're gonna die. If we go back over there, we're gonna die. I

804
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,679
mean, we have no food. If we go to the Assyrians, I mean, it's possible that

805
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:05,760
they would spare us. What happens? They go and they find the tents empty, but all

806
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:14,559
the spoil is there, but the soldiers are gone. And they had plenty. I'm wondering

807
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,200
this morning, if when the children of Israel, who were very familiar with their

808
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,040
history, read this verse of Scripture, their mind raced back to the event that

809
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm referring to. You could look back in 2 Kings chapter number 7 and read of

810
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:38,080
the event and read of what happens. And that man says, the one that leaned, whose

811
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,760
hand the king leaned, answered the man of God and said, if the Lord would make

812
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,359
windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, behold, thou shalt see it

813
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:49,280
with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat thereof. And if you go to the end of the

814
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,720
passage, you see that the Bible says that the people went out and spoiled the tents

815
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,119
of the Assyrians in verse number 16. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a

816
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,640
shekel, two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.

817
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,080
You understand that before that, they were to the point where they were

818
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:12,520
killing their own offspring because they were starving. I can't even comprehend.

819
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,400
And God says to these people that were robbing him, they were guilty of robbing

820
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,799
him, wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings? You're under a curse. He

821
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:27,919
says, therefore, here's the remedy. Bring ye all the tithes in the storehouse. He

822
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:35,880
says, prove me in the passage, prove me now herewith, sayeth the Lord. If I will

823
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,559
not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall

824
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,000
not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,

825
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,720
and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, neither shall your vine cast

826
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,200
her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations

827
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,400
shall call you blessed, for you shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of

828
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,440
hosts. As we think about this passage of scripture within the context of what

829
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,440
we're dealing with this morning, with our conduct in the present, listen.

830
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,080
there's something I can give to God today of my treasures, of my tithes, and

831
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,920
my offerings for the work of the Lord. You understand that David, prior

832
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:25,240
to his death, he gave from his own resources in order for the temple to be

833
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:30,840
built. A temple that he would never step into, a temple that he would never

834
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:37,920
worship God from, but he gave of his own resources. But when he died, he no longer

835
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,040
would have the opportunity to do those things. And so this mortal must put on

836
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,760
immortality. When we think about this truth of giving of our own resources to

837
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,480
the Lord, and we think about the the indictment against these people in

838
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,640
Malachi 3, and we think about the promise that God has given, I'm mindful of how

839
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,240
the prophet of God said, hey you're working to earn this money, but you're

840
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,760
putting it in bags with holes. Why? Because you're robbing me. But God says

841
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,720
if you prove me, if you do the right thing, if you live by faith, if you give

842
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,279
to the Lord, I'm gonna bless, and I'm gonna rebuke the devourer. Listen, I want

843
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:21,440
the blessing of God, and I want God to rebuke the devourer. And so this morning

844
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,120
we think about our conduct in the present, and we think about a few

845
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:33,520
examples of things that I can do while I still am in this earthly tabernacle. I

846
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:48,120
can live by faith. Then I shall see him. I can share the gospel. I can give. But

847
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,880
when this mortal shall put on immortality, those opportunities are gone.

848
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,800
Can't do it anymore. I'm gonna read you a poem. Many of you perhaps have heard it

849
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:06,600
before. C.T. Studd wrote this poem, Only One Life. Two little lines I heard one

850
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:15,160
day, traveling along life's busy way, bringing conviction to my heart, and from

851
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:26,680
my mind would not depart. Only one life till soon be past. Only what's done for

852
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:36,639
Christ will last. Only one life, yes, only one. Soon will its fleeting hours be done.

853
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:45,919
Then, in that day, my Lord to meet, and stand before his judgment seat. Only one

854
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:54,600
life till soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will last. Only one life, the

855
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:02,080
still small voice, gently pleads for a better choice, bidding my

856
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:09,160
selfish aims to leave, and to God's holy will to cleave. Only one life till soon

857
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,839
be past. Only what's done for Christ will last. Only one life, a few brief years.

858
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:22,600
Each with its burdens, hopes, and fears. Each with its clays I must fulfill,

859
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:28,559
living for self or in his will. Only one life till soon be past. Only what's done

860
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,520
for Christ will last. When this bright world would tempt me sore, when Satan

861
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:40,279
would a victory score, when self would seek to have its way, then help me, Lord,

862
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:48,119
with joy to say, only one life till soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will

863
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:56,639
last. Give me, Father, a purpose deep, in joy or sorrow, thy word to keep. Faithful

864
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:04,160
and true, what e'er the strife, pleasing thee in my daily life. Only one life

865
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:11,839
till soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will last. Oh, let me love with

866
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:18,360
fervor burn, and from the world now let me turn, living for thee and thee alone,

867
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:25,880
bringing thee pleasure on thy throne. Only one life till soon be past. Only

868
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:34,880
what's done for Christ will last. Only one life, yes, only one. Now let me say,

869
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,480
thy will be done, and when at last I'll hear the call, I know I'll say, t'was

870
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,640
worth it all. Only one life till soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will

871
00:54:48,640 --> 00:55:00,799
last. I believe this morning there's a child of God, the promise that is before

872
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:07,640
us, it's certain. This mortal must put on immortality, but I wonder how it's

873
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:14,679
impacted my conduct for the present. See, I don't believe that as a child of God I

874
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,519
would lay upon my deathbed and regret living by faith. I don't think I'd lay on

875
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:30,720
my deathbed and regret sharing the gospel. I don't believe that I would lay

876
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:38,279
upon my deathbed and regret giving to the Lord. But I'd say this, there are many

877
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,959
people that have taken their final breath, that laid upon their deathbed,

878
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:52,679
and they said, I wish, I wish I would have done more. I wish I would have lived by

879
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:59,679
faith. I wish I would have shared the gospel with more people. I wish I would

880
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:06,799
have given of my time, my talents, and my treasures. And with regret they lay upon

881
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:15,119
that deathbed. Not saying I regret doing living for God, no, I regret not doing

882
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,519
more. And when we understand the certainty of this promise in 1st

883
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:28,119
Corinthians 15, it's designed to impact our conduct in the present. I'm looking

884
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:33,399
toward that day when I see my Savior face to face. Listen, it's closer now

885
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:39,279
than it's ever been. I'm a day closer to eternity and so are you. And that's a

886
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:44,959
certain promise. But I wonder about our conduct in the present. Oh, would God help

887
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:52,600
us to live by faith, to live for him, understanding as this man of God

888
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:59,640
from yesteryear said in this poem, only one life will soon be passed. Only what's

889
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:07,799
done for Christ will last. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you

890
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,880
for the Word of God and the truth contained therein. I thank you for the

891
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,119
privilege of having the Bible. Thank you for the challenge that you've given to

892
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,320
me in my own life. I pray that you've used your word this morning to challenge

893
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:32,720
the folks that have watched, tuned in, been part of our service today. God, that

894
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:40,239
we would surrender our lives and our wills to you. That your word would impact

895
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:48,920
our perspective with regard to eternity and also with regard to this life. I'm so

896
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:57,559
thankful for the promise that this mortal must put on immortality. But as I

897
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:06,040
meditate upon those things that I no longer will be able to do, I wonder how

898
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:12,920
that promise has impacted my current conduct, my conduct in the

899
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:19,600
present. Lord, help me to live by faith. Help me to share the gospel. Help me to

900
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:28,160
give. Lord, help me to serve you acceptably. I pray that you would move

901
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:35,760
and work in the lives of your people. Lord, that decisions would be made today,

902
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,039
decisions that would please thee, decisions that would cause us to be

903
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:46,599
conformed to the image of Christ. Would you help us today to have a high level

904
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:56,880
of enthusiasm to obey the Word of God, God Almighty? Well, thank you for the work

905
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,919
that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
