1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
special music this morning, I didn't want you to be afraid that I was going to sing

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:12,720
this morning, thus I shared with you my experience yesterday in kindly declining the opportunity

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,399
even there yesterday, but I will spare you this morning as well.

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,799
First Timothy 2, verses 4 through 7, and thankful for God's Word, the Bible says this,

5
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:28,760
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth?

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,139
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, notice

7
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:43,560
verse 6, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, whereunto I am

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,759
ordained a preacher, an apostle, I speak the truth in Christ, and, lie not, a teacher of

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,360
the Gentiles in faith and verity.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,080
In the midst of this exhortation on prayer, remember he begins in verse number 1, I exhort

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,239
therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks

12
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,160
be made for all men.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,160
And then as we looked at it last week, the Holy Spirit of God zeroed in on this truth

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,199
for kings and for all that are in authority.

15
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:20,800
I hope you prayed for our leaders last week, and I mentioned to you that I jotted down

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
the names.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,040
One person contacted me for the websites that I referenced, and they said, well, that just

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,680
added 12 names to my prayer list, and I said, well, praise the Lord.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,599
And I prayed for our leaders this week by name, and I hope that you have as well.

20
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,360
And we find that in the midst of this exhortation that God gives us on the subject matter of

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:49,279
prayer, right in the midst of it we find that God reveals His will for humanity.

22
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,839
Often we hear people talk about God's will.

23
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:57,319
No doubt you've mentioned at some point the will of God or God's will, and we understand

24
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,680
what we mean by that.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,080
And I am thankful that God has preserved His word for us so that we can know His will.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,240
See, this morning we do not have to reach our own conclusions regarding the will of

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
God.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,619
We go to the Word of God, and we understand that in the Word of God, God has revealed

29
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:21,039
to us who He is, who we are, and what His will is for humanity.

30
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,020
Knowing the will of God will impact how we behave.

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,720
Knowing the will of God will impact how we behave.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Knowing the will of God will impact our worldview.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,679
You know, there are people today, they talk about your worldview and seeking to influence

34
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:42,119
your worldview or shape or mold your worldview.

35
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,559
They'll use that type of terminology.

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,179
Listen, it's the Bible, it's the will of God that should mold and shape our worldview.

37
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:56,080
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, it seems very obvious to me

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,020
that knowing the will of God will influence how we pray.

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,860
Right in the midst of the exhortation on prayer, it's almost like it's a parenthetical statement

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,600
in verses 4 through 7, and in the midst of this exhortation on prayer, God reveals to

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,440
us His will for humanity, why?

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Because God's will will influence how we pray.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,559
Knowing the will of God influences your prayer life and my prayer life.

44
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:31,160
Hold your place here, let me read to you 1 John chapter number 5.

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,320
In 1 John chapter 5, many of us are familiar with verse number 13, and speaking about the

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,619
assurance of salvation and what a precious verse that is.

47
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:47,679
But in 1 John chapter 5, in verse number 14, the Bible says this, and this is the confidence

48
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:59,460
that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.

49
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,779
And if we know that He heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions

50
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,380
that we desired of Him.

51
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,759
And so we find that in 1 John 5, 14, we have this truth of we're to pray according to the

52
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,139
will of God.

53
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:20,260
And so in the midst of this exhortation on prayer, God reveals to us His will for humanity.

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,679
I've titled the message, as you see in the bulletin this morning, God's will for humanity.

55
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,820
As we look at these few verses of Scripture, I want to share three thoughts with you this

56
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,779
morning from this portion of Scripture that I believe God is giving us that will help

57
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:44,380
us shape our worldview, influence our behavior, and influence our prayer lives when we understand

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,220
this is God's will.

59
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,299
With me this morning, notice number one, if you will.

60
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:55,579
God's will is for lost people to be saved.

61
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:59,940
God's will is for lost people to be saved.

62
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,100
Have you ever prayed or have you ever heard someone pray, Lord, if it would be your will,

63
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
would you save them?

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,500
No, you don't need to pray that way.

65
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,579
We know that it's God's will.

66
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,619
God does not arbitrarily save them.

67
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,739
They have to accept the gift that He offers.

68
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:21,559
But we can be confident this morning that it is God's will that lost people are saved.

69
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,059
Why do we go and preach the gospel?

70
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,500
Why do we pass out gospel tracts?

71
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,179
Why do we, well, because we know it's God's will for lost people to be saved.

72
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,179
Remember this morning, there are two groups of people in the world.

73
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,540
There are people that are lost and there are people that are saved.

74
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,100
As you boil it all down, if you look at it all, you come to the very end of it, you say

75
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,339
there are two groups of people in the world, saved people and lost people.

76
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,899
Those of us this morning, I'm in the category of being saved, amen?

77
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,700
I've been saved by the blood of Christ.

78
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,619
Heaven is my home, no doubt about it.

79
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:53,820
Jesus is mine, I am His, hallelujah.

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,899
I am so thankful for the truth of salvation.

81
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,739
I've been born again by the Spirit of God through the blood of Christ.

82
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:04,100
Praise the Lord for knowing that you're saved.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,380
But remember, for every one of us this morning that are saved, there was a time that we were

84
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,679
lost.

85
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:15,739
So everyone that's in that category of being saved, at one point you were in the category

86
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:16,739
of being lost.

87
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:20,619
And if you say, no, I was born saved, you need to be saved.

88
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,779
You need to be born again, amen?

89
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,820
On the authority of God's Word, why?

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Because you're not born saved, you're born lost.

91
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,940
You're born at enmity with God.

92
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,059
In fact, Ephesians chapter number two explains that in great detail with regard to we all

93
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,299
had our conversation in times past.

94
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,799
We all were in that same condition of being lost.

95
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:49,700
But we notice here in this portion of Scripture, in verse number four, notice what the Bible

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,619
says in 1 Timothy 2 and verse number four, who will have, notice what it says, all men

97
00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:01,579
to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

98
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:08,179
Why do I say this is God's will for the humanity when we look at God's will for lost people

99
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,179
to be saved?

100
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,940
Because it says, who will have all men to be saved.

101
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,779
Now it doesn't mean that all men are going to be saved.

102
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,019
It simply means that his will is for all men to be saved.

103
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:26,019
There's not one person that can stand at the great white throne judgment of God and say,

104
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,899
you were not willing to save me.

105
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,179
Not one person can stand there and say that.

106
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,859
No, Jesus died for the world.

107
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:39,140
In fact, look at verse number six, who gave himself a ransom.

108
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,579
What does it say?

109
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,579
For all.

110
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,579
For how many?

111
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,579
For all.

112
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,540
And we see in verse number four, who will have how many men?

113
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
All men.

114
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,059
Verse number six, who gave himself a ransom for how many?

115
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,459
For all to be testified in due time.

116
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,739
And so we find in verse number four, and again in verse number six, this word all that is

117
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,059
so important for us to understand.

118
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:04,660
And we find that God says that he will have all men to be saved.

119
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,859
He gave himself Jesus Christ when he hung upon the cross of Calvary.

120
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:12,299
He was paying for the sin of humanity.

121
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,980
He was paying for your sin, and for my sin, and for your neighbor's sin, and for your

122
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,019
parents' sin, and your children's sin, and your…

123
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,940
He was paying for the sin of mankind.

124
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,200
By the way, we find that Calvinism with its teaching of unconditional election and a limited

125
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,500
atonement are exposed as being false teaching by these simple verses of Scripture.

126
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,580
I want you to understand this morning, and I know it's not popular, but it's biblical

127
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,780
that this idea of Calvinism is creeping into our churches all across this land.

128
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,219
It's creeping into our Bible colleges, into our seminaries, and it's creeping into the

129
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:51,559
pews and into the pulpits of America.

130
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,059
It's a problem.

131
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,859
The reason that it's a problem is because Calvinism doesn't align with the Bible.

132
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:03,239
And let me tell you, you can go to the internet and you can find a lot of Calvinistic preachers.

133
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:06,380
You can find a lot of them that align with Calvinism.

134
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,299
And the problem is that the Bible teaches something different.

135
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,619
The Bible doesn't teach unconditional election.

136
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,780
The Bible doesn't teach limited atonement.

137
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,140
We're not looking at all of the tenets, if you will, of Calvinism, but in just three

138
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,919
verses of Scripture, those two tenets are exposed as being false teaching.

139
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,260
And we find that what happens is Calvinists have to get very creative, and they say, well,

140
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,659
all doesn't really mean all.

141
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,979
You'll hear that repeatedly.

142
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,940
When you look at Ephesians chapter number one, understand with me this morning, we do

143
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,900
not have to be afraid of the Word that God uses in His Word.

144
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,859
Look at it actually with me in Ephesians 1.

145
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,859
We don't have to be fearful of this.

146
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:56,219
We do not have to be fearful of using the Word predestinated.

147
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,700
God's Word uses that Word.

148
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
But we have to be afraid of the Word that God uses in His Word.

149
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,380
have to understand the context of what God uses it with.

150
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,060
In Ephesians chapter one, notice the Bible says

151
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,140
in verse number three,

152
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,860
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

153
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,780
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings

154
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,100
and heavenly places in Christ.

155
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,140
Notice verse four.

156
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,540
According as he hath chosen us in him

157
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,220
before the foundation of the world,

158
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,900
that we should be holy without blame before him in love.

159
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
So we look at the idea of the choosing.

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,460
Again, they'll use that idea of unconditional election.

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,220
He says that he chose us in him

162
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,660
before the foundation of the world.

163
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,580
Don't get afraid.

164
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,500
Don't think this is unconditional election

165
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,660
because he says that we should be holy without blame.

166
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,020
That is God's will for God's people.

167
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,660
Those that get saved is that we would be holy

168
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,140
and without blame before him in love.

169
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,220
Notice in verse five,

170
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,100
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children,

171
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
notice what it says,

172
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,820
by Jesus Christ to himself

173
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,020
according to the good pleasure of his will.

174
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
What happens in Ephesians one

175
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,900
is they use the word choose and predestinate it

176
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,820
and they run with Calvinism.

177
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,460
But the problem is that Ephesians one

178
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,220
is not talking about the who of salvation.

179
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,660
Not at all.

180
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,500
Ephesians one is talking about the how of salvation.

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,300
You know, Tim, what God determined

182
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,780
before the foundation of the world,

183
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,380
he determined there's only one way to be saved.

184
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,740
That's through Jesus Christ.

185
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,780
That's why Peter is able to say

186
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,820
that Jesus is the lamb that was slain

187
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,660
before the foundation of the world.

188
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,500
Amen?

189
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,860
Because God predetermined,

190
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,860
he predestined the how of salvation.

191
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,340
It would be through Jesus Christ.

192
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,060
By the way, if you look at the Old Testament,

193
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,300
you look at so many things that happen in the Old Testament,

194
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,100
what's happening is it's a, really,

195
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,780
it's a spiritual war that's going against

196
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,700
trying to destroy the messianic line

197
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,620
so that Jesus can't come.

198
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,980
But greater is he that is in us.

199
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,740
Listen, God is omnipotent.

200
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,780
We have an enemy who's powerful,

201
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,700
but God is all powerful.

202
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,460
And Messiah came.

203
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,740
Aren't you thankful?

204
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,060
And he went to the cross

205
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,300
and he shed his blood for all of humanity.

206
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,540
And God's will, we can say with confidence this morning,

207
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,540
that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

208
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,860
And the truth, don't be afraid of Ephesians 1.

209
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,420
Don't be afraid of Romans 9 and 10.

210
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,620
We don't have to fear it.

211
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,660
We just have to understand what God is saying in his word.

212
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,980
And he's saying, listen,

213
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,500
there's only one way to be saved, through Jesus Christ.

214
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
Notice with me, though,

215
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,740
that it's not just this portion of scripture

216
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,940
that reveals to us God's will for lost people to be saved.

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,900
Take your Bible and turn over.

218
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,020
Well, actually, you're probably still there

219
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,460
in 1 Timothy chapter two.

220
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,420
Look at chapter one just for a moment.

221
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,140
We mentioned this passage of scripture a few weeks ago.

222
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,980
And look at verses 15 and 16.

223
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,500
In 1 Timothy one, verses 15 and 16,

224
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,860
notice what Paul says,

225
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,700
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

226
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,860
This is a faithful saying, a truthful saying,

227
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,020
and worthy of all acceptation.

228
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,140
What is this saying?

229
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,140
Well, that Christ Jesus came into the world

230
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,700
to save sinners.

231
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,900
Amen?

232
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,980
Then he says this, of whom I am chief.

233
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,300
Now, notice verse 16,

234
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,860
how be it for this cause I obtain mercy

235
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,100
that in me first Jesus Christ

236
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
might show forth all longsuffering

237
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,940
for a pattern to them,

238
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,340
which should hereafter believe on him

239
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,580
to life everlasting.

240
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,540
In Ephesians one, the same portion of scripture,

241
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,700
we're not gonna go back there,

242
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,340
but it says later on in chapter number one,

243
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,380
in whom you trusted after you believed.

244
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,500
And so they heard, or after you heard,

245
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,620
they heard the truth of the gospel,

246
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,060
Paul comes in and preaches,

247
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,540
and they believe it, they accept Christ,

248
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,420
and they're born again.

249
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,700
They're adopted in the family of God.

250
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,340
And so we find that Paul says

251
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,220
that Christ Jesus came to save sinners,

252
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,180
of whom I am chief,

253
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,860
and then there's this pattern

254
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
for those that would believe on him

255
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
to life everlasting.

256
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,059
By the way, if you look at verse 16,

257
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,020
and really carry out the thought of it,

258
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,740
he has us in mind.

259
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,900
Because we heard and we believed,

260
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,580
if you're saved here this morning,

261
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,059
the truth of 2 Peter chapter three in verse nine.

262
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,380
Maybe you wanna jot it down.

263
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,140
The Bible says that the Lord

264
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,779
is longsuffering to us, word,

265
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,940
not willing that any should perish.

266
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,740
It begins, the Lord is not slack

267
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,940
concerning his promise to us, word,

268
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,500
as some men count slackness.

269
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,340
What are they talking about?

270
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,420
Well, some say, no, he's not gonna come back.

271
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,420
Where is the promise of his coming?

272
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,900
That's how 2 Peter three,

273
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,540
with those scoffers and mockers,

274
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,940
and that's what's being dealt with.

275
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,420
And then Peter says,

276
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,860
the Lord is not slack

277
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,380
concerning his promise to us, word,

278
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,620
as some men count slackness.

279
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
But what?

280
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,900
He's longsuffering to us, word.

281
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,380
Notice, not willing that any should perish,

282
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,540
but that all should come to repentance.

283
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,860
But I want you to see it in 1 John chapter two.

284
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,140
Turn over there if you will.

285
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,300
In 1 John chapter two,

286
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
as you're turning there,

287
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,140
I wanna remind you of a familiar verse of scripture

288
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,180
that many of us could quote this morning,

289
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,540
and that's John 3, 16.

290
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,980
For God so loved, what?

291
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,820
The world.

292
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,779
For God so loved the world that he, what?

293
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,140
He gave his only begotten son,

294
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,380
that whosoever, don't you like that word?

295
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,900
Whosoever will may come.

296
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,740
We sing the song.

297
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,020
What a wonderful song it is.

298
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,860
Whosoever shall believe.

299
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,779
Right, what are they gonna have?

300
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,540
Everlasting life.

301
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,340
For God so loved the world that he gave

302
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,700
his only begotten son,

303
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,340
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

304
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,420
but have everlasting life.

305
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,860
So again, when those that would follow

306
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,380
the tenets of Calvinism would say,

307
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,260
well, all doesn't really mean all.

308
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,340
It just means all of the elect.

309
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,500
So then when you say, well, John 3, 16 says,

310
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,660
for God so loved the world,

311
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,059
they say, yeah, it doesn't really mean world

312
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,779
as in including everybody.

313
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,380
It just means the elect world.

314
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,260
But I want you to notice what the Bible says in 1 John.

315
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,340
I love God's word.

316
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,700
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

317
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,500
And in 1 John 2, it's a precious truth

318
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,460
that God gives us in verse number one,

319
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,500
that Jesus is our advocate.

320
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,779
Praise God for that.

321
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,500
And it says this in verse number one,

322
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,580
my little children, these things have I write unto you,

323
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,460
that you sin not.

324
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,860
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

325
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,620
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

326
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,540
Notice what it says, and he, who is he?

327
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,500
Well, Jesus Christ, our advocate.

328
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,340
And he is the propitiation for our sins.

329
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,340
Literally the truth of the covering, the blood,

330
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,420
the atonement, the mercy seat is in view,

331
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,420
he satisfied the demand for sin, the penalty.

332
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,620
So he is the propitiation for our sins.

333
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,140
Now, John is writing in 1 John to save people, amen?

334
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,980
He's writing to save people.

335
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,100
So he says, he is the propitiation for our sins.

336
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,140
Now, we believe that this morning,

337
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,620
but we believe that God's will is for all people to be saved,

338
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,940
that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

339
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Notice what he says, and not for ours only,

340
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,260
but also for the sins of the whole world.

341
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm thankful this morning that God's will

342
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,540
is for lost people to be saved.

343
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,580
Why am I thankful for that?

344
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,540
Because I used to be a lost person, amen?

345
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,420
And God saved me by his amazing grace.

346
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,740
And what a blessing.

347
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,940
And I want you to understand this morning,

348
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,059
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

349
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,940
knowing the will of God will shape our worldview.

350
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,460
It will impact our behavior,

351
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,500
but it will also influence our prayer.

352
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,300
It's this parenthetical statement

353
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,460
in 1 Timothy chapter two,

354
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,540
in the midst of an exhortation on prayer,

355
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,460
that God reveals his plan, his will for humanity.

356
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,140
And the first aspect is for lost people to be saved.

357
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,400
How does that influence my prayer life?

358
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
Paul says this in Romans chapter 10.

359
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
I think it's a great example for us to know

360
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,320
as we think about how this parenthetical statement

361
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,080
of giving to us God's will for humanity

362
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,960
in the midst of an exhortation on prayer

363
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,880
reveals how knowing God's will influences my prayer life.

364
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Here's what Paul says in Romans 10 in verse one.

365
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,679
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer

366
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,520
to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

367
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
So that's a prayer request,

368
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
that's a prayer of Paul's

369
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,760
that's influenced by knowing the will of God.

370
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,679
Amen?

371
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,720
And so when we look at this portion of scripture

372
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,239
this morning and we make application for our lives,

373
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,919
we know that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

374
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,960
But how has that influenced me?

375
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,880
If I know that it's God's will for lost people to be saved,

376
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
then I ought to be active in sharing the gospel.

377
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,760
Amen?

378
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,040
It means that I ought to be praying for people to be saved.

379
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,720
Because knowing the will of God influences my prayer life.

380
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,480
Notice with me number two this morning,

381
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,359
not only is God's will for lost people to be saved,

382
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:01,119
but number two, back in 1 Timothy chapter

383
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,960
number two, God's will for lost people to be saved.

384
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually.

385
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,040
God's will is for lost people to be saved,

386
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,040
but then God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually.

387
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,900
We find in our text of scripture, again,

388
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,280
in 1 Timothy chapter two,

389
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,180
notice what the Bible says in verse number four,

390
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,780
who will have all men to be saved,

391
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,040
but then it says this,

392
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,380
and to come under the knowledge of the truth.

393
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,080
And then verse number five, again,

394
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,420
I'm thankful for this wonderful promise or truth

395
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,780
that God reveals to us.

396
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,880
Notice it says, for there's one God

397
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,280
and one mediator between God and men,

398
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,000
the man, Christ, Jesus.

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This exposes the teaching

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that you have to go through some priest to get to God.

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm thankful that we are priests of God

402
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
and we can go direct access to the throne of heaven.

403
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,100
That is an amazing privilege, by the way.

404
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,840
And when we look at verse four and five,

405
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,300
and we consider the thought this morning

406
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,180
that God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually,

407
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,340
we understand two aspects here

408
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,980
of that growing in the knowledge of the truth.

409
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,820
It says, and to have to come

410
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,420
unto the knowledge of the truth.

411
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,660
Where do I get that from?

412
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,420
Well, God's word is truth.

413
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,320
He says, sanctify them through thy word.

414
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,360
Thy word is truth.

415
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,700
And so we understand that we're to grow by this book

416
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,560
and this book will grow us up in our faith,

417
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,220
but we also understand the aspect,

418
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,320
according to verse number five, of prayer.

419
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,700
Prayer.

420
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,420
You know, as you grow spiritually,

421
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,580
you're gonna learn more about this book

422
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,300
and you're gonna grow in your prayer life.

423
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,180
And those things work together.

424
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,780
In fact, we sing a song with our children in VBS

425
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
and in Children's Church.

426
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,660
Read your Bible, pray every day,

427
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,380
and you'll grow, grow, grow, right?

428
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,480
Many of you have heard the song.

429
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,860
Maybe you've had the opportunity

430
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,660
to hear us sing it at some point,

431
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,060
but we sing that with the children.

432
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,900
Why?

433
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,020
Because we understand that reading and praying,

434
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,380
reading God's word and praying

435
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,740
helps us to grow spiritually.

436
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,860
And it is God's will for lost people to be saved,

437
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,040
but then not to just, okay, I'm saved.

438
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,740
No, now God's will for you

439
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,220
when you leave the category of being lost

440
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,260
to going into the category of being saved,

441
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,660
God's will is for you to grow spiritually.

442
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,900
We know that here from 1 Timothy 2,

443
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,120
but notice with me a few other verses of Scripture.

444
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,480
Turn over to Hebrews 5, if you will.

445
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Hebrews 5, and really,

446
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640
this is an interesting passage of Scripture

447
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,200
where Paul speaks to these.

448
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
I believe Paul wrote the book of Hebrews.

449
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
The Bible college answer is God wrote it

450
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,080
because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

451
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,160
People debate over it,

452
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
but I believe Paul was the human penman.

453
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,080
But the reality is that here,

454
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,640
and then also in 1 Corinthians 11,

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,340
two times the verbiage isn't used here,

456
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,680
but it's as if Paul is saying

457
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,900
he uses this verbiage in 1 Corinthians 11.

458
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,460
I praise you not.

459
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,060
Like, I'm not commending you for this.

460
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,380
This, in fact, I'm speaking really to your shame.

461
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,460
What is it that he speaks of?

462
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,140
Well, notice with me in Hebrews 5 in verse number 11.

463
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,340
He says, of whom we have many things to say

464
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,320
and hard to be uttered.

465
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,860
Why are they hard to be uttered?

466
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,100
Well, not because I don't understand them,

467
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,440
not because I don't know how to communicate them,

468
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,700
but because ye are dull of hearing.

469
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,940
So Paul says, this is difficult

470
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,020
because we have many things to say,

471
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
we have many things to teach you,

472
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,900
but you're dull of hearing.

473
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,780
And notice in verse number 12, he says,

474
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,520
for when for the time you ought to be teachers.

475
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,320
That means that they'd been saved for a while.

476
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,420
They'd left the category of being lost and being saved

477
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,180
and they're to grow spiritually.

478
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,660
He says, in the time that you ought to be teachers,

479
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,740
ye have need that one teach you again,

480
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,160
which be the first principles of the oracles of God.

481
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,400
There becomes such as have need of milk

482
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,320
and not of strong meat.

483
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,560
And that reminds us of the truth of 1 Peter 2

484
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,400
in verse number two.

485
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
The Bible says, as newborn babes,

486
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,440
desire the sincere milk of the word

487
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,720
that ye may grow thereby.

488
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
And so listen, it's not a bad thing

489
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,400
to need the milk of the word.

490
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,860
That's where we all begin.

491
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,360
But I'm so thankful.

492
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,220
Physically, I'm thankful I'm not still on a milk diet.

493
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,140
Hallelujah.

494
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,100
But spiritually, we ought not be on a milk diet.

495
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,620
We're to grow.

496
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,880
Amen.

497
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,700
And so he says, notice he says,

498
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,700
that ye have need of milk and not of strong meat.

499
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,360
Notice verse 13, for everyone that useth milk

500
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,300
is unskillful in the word of righteousness,

501
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,820
for he is a babe.

502
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,220
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,

503
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,620
even those who by reason of use

504
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,840
have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

505
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,440
Now here's the amazing thing spiritually.

506
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,040
You don't have to be saved for a certain period of time

507
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,700
in order to be a mature Christian.

508
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,340
So physically speaking, there are certain things

509
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,840
that a baby cannot eat.

510
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,960
They have to be on a milk diet for a certain period of time,

511
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,800
and then everything they eat is pureed.

512
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Isn't that awful?

513
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,040
I mean, honestly.

514
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
I am not interested in eating baby food.

515
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
Julianna's been feeding some baby food to Nova.

516
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,720
No thank you.

517
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I've not offered to taste it.

518
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,900
I don't wanna smell it.

519
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,440
I like my food the way I eat it, amen.

520
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,320
But physically, Nova can't handle the piece of chicken

521
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,760
that I eat or the green bean that I eat, right?

522
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,120
She can't handle it.

523
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,480
And so there's a, we understand that physically,

524
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,600
but spiritually, you can be mature

525
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,140
and not be very quote-unquote old in the Lord.

526
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,100
Why do I say that?

527
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,660
Well, because you're as close to God,

528
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,760
you're as mature spiritually as you really wanna be.

529
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,380
We, this past week, we've read our Bibles

530
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,020
as much as we've really wanted to.

531
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,340
We've prayed as much as we've really wanted to.

532
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,660
We've engaged, listen, it's a desire that we have,

533
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,480
that we wanna grow.

534
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,860
He says, as newborn babies, desire,

535
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,900
this is the same miracle of the word,

536
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,240
that ye may grow thereby.

537
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,300
But then we are to grow beyond that.

538
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,980
We're to get into the meat of the word of God.

539
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,700
We find that 2 Peter 3, in verse number 18,

540
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,660
here's what God says, and it's a great ending

541
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,260
to the book of 2 Peter, but grow in grace

542
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,060
in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

543
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,700
To him be glory, both now and forever, amen.

544
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,820
You know what the best remedy is for false teaching?

545
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,280
Spiritual growth, spiritual growth.

546
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,560
Because when you grow spiritually,

547
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,240
when you get into this book, when you grow,

548
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,680
you can expose false teaching.

549
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,320
You can identify false teaching.

550
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,660
You can see it, because you're growing spiritually.

551
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,320
And so we find that God's will, number one,

552
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,760
is for lost people to be saved,

553
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,080
but God's will, number two,

554
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,120
is for saved people to grow spiritually.

555
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,960
So just as we made application with the first truth,

556
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,920
we make application with the second truth.

557
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,740
What are we doing personally to grow spiritually?

558
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,180
How, maybe I can ask it this way,

559
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,960
what are we doing to help someone else grow spiritually?

560
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,040
What are we doing to help somebody else grow spiritually?

561
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,780
You know, Nova can't feed herself right now.

562
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,980
If you can't feed yourself right now,

563
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,020
somebody, you have, you've broken something,

564
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,420
you have a, but she physically cannot

565
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,620
feed herself right now.

566
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,800
You know, the reality is that spiritually speaking,

567
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,360
there's some babes in Christ that need a mature brother

568
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,560
or sister to come alongside and help them to grow.

569
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,320
You ever know the phrase, we use it,

570
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
they're spoon-fed, right?

571
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Why, because they can't feed themselves.

572
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,360
So I don't know where you were when you first got saved,

573
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,920
but I know when I first got saved,

574
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,640
I didn't know anything about this book.

575
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
I didn't know where to begin.

576
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
I didn't know what, I didn't know anything.

577
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,620
And so I'm thankful that there were some spiritual leaders

578
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,220
in my life that came alongside

579
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,980
and helped me to grow spiritually.

580
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,180
By the way, that's the fulfilling of the Great Commission,

581
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,100
not only to preach the gospel and to baptize them,

582
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,980
but to disciple them.

583
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,780
And we find here that we are to be engaged in ourselves.

584
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,940
What are we doing to grow?

585
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,200
Don't be comfortable and content with where you are.

586
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,140
The Christian life is very interesting.

587
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,020
There really is no time that you're stagnant

588
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,380
in the Christian life.

589
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,800
You're either going forward or you're going backward.

590
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
Seriously.

591
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,119
Don't be content with where you are.

592
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,520
Desire, as Paul, I think about Paul.

593
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,080
For many of us, in 1 Timothy, he says,

594
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm the chief of all sinners.

595
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,800
But for many of us, we have Paul in our minds

596
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
as this great Christian,

597
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,960
and he certainly was a man that followed God.

598
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,800
He's a man that we can learn much from.

599
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,280
But you know what Paul says in Philippians 3?

600
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,440
That I may know him.

601
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,520
He wasn't content with where he was.

602
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,880
He wanted to grow more.

603
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,679
He wanted to learn more about his Lord and his Savior.

604
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,260
Not only did we say that we should be engaged

605
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,660
in seeking how God's will, how has it affected my behavior,

606
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,940
but we said it should affect our prayer lives.

607
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,980
It's within this exhortation on prayer

608
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,940
that God reveals his will for humanity.

609
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,100
And I want you to understand

610
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,200
that in Ephesians chapter number three,

611
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,900
Paul is praying for the believers in Ephesus.

612
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,420
In Ephesians chapter number three,

613
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,559
as Paul is praying for the believers in Ephesus,

614
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,440
it's very interesting because Paul is praying

615
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,160
that these believers in Ephesus

616
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,100
would be strengthened spiritually, that they would grow.

617
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,280
Notice with me, beginning in verse number 14 of Ephesians 3.

618
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,080
See, Paul is praying for these believers in Ephesus

619
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,040
according to the will of God.

620
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,280
And it says in Ephesians 3 and verse 14,

621
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,920
for this cause I bow my knees unto the Father

622
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
of our Lord.

623
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,720
Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is name, that

624
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,840
he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, notice, to be

625
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,200
strengthened with might by his Spirit, where? In the inner man. Listen, we need

626
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,040
to be praying that way one for another. So often our prayer requests one for

627
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,880
another are physical, but we need to be praying spiritually for our brothers and

628
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,960
sisters in Christ. We, listen, we're engaged in spiritual battle and

629
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,520
spiritual warfare, and we need to be strengthened in our inner man. We find

630
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,120
that he says that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being

631
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,800
rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is

632
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,200
the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ,

633
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,320
which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God. Why

634
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,240
is Paul praying this way? Well, because he understands God's will is for saved

635
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,320
people to grow spiritually. Paul has grown, and Paul says, I want these

636
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,440
believers in Ephesus to grow spiritually, so I'm praying for them. He prays for the

637
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,280
believers in Colossae in Colossians chapter number one. Now it's interesting

638
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,200
because in Ephesians chapter 3, Paul had a personal relationship with these

639
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,480
people. He knew the people at the church at Ephesus. He had ministered there, but

640
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,600
now when we come to the book of Colossians, Paul did not minister there.

641
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,280
He did not. God didn't use Paul to start the church in Colossae, but he heard

642
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,000
about their faith, and what does he do? He begins to pray for them. And notice with me

643
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,560
in Colossians 1, how does Paul pray for these believers in Colossae? Well, in

644
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,280
verse number 9, it says, for this cause we also, notice what he says, since the day

645
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,000
we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled

646
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,960
with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that

647
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,200
ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every

648
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,320
good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. I won't read the rest

649
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,400
of the prayer, but this is biblical praying. And it's praying according to

650
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,000
the will of God, because God's will is not simply that lost people are saved,

651
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,400
but God's will is that saved people grow spiritually. We ought to be praying. You

652
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,880
know, sometimes, you know, God uses a variety of things to grow us. Some things,

653
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,760
sometimes, God uses the things that we dislike the most to grow us. Amen?

654
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,880
Sometimes, God will put somebody in your life to grow you. The person that you

655
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,120
want to get, you understand what I'm saying? They bother you. God says, I'm

656
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,280
helping you grow. The psalmist says in Psalm 119, it was good for me to be

657
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,320
afflicted. I don't know about you, but I don't like affliction. But he says, it's good

658
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,680
for me, because then I learned thy statutes. I grew. Listen, David, he was, he

659
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:13,440
was displeased when Uzzah touched the ark and he died. But you know what

660
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,640
happened in that tragedy? David grew. David grew. He found out we better do

661
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,960
God's work God's way. And guess what? When they brought the ark the second time,

662
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,960
when they took it out of the house where it was stored for three months, they did

663
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,520
it the right way. They did it God's way. And so we find here that we're to pray

664
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,200
God. Listen, sometimes we pray someone's dealing with a trial and affliction and

665
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,600
we pray for them in that trial or affliction, which is great, it's

666
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,920
commendable, but don't stop too short. What do I mean by that? Well, maybe you need to add

667
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,480
this to the prayer. God, in that, would you help them to grow spiritually? Would you

668
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:13,720
help them to learn more about you? That's praying biblically. So God's

669
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,000
will, when we understand it, it impacts our behavior. It influences our worldview, but

670
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,279
it also influences how we pray. We see that Paul says, I'm praying for my

671
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:29,720
brethren that they would be saved. Why? Because he understands God's will is for

672
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,000
lost people to be saved. We find that Paul is praying for those in Ephesus and

673
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,839
those in Colossae that they would grow spiritually, that they'd be strengthened, they would

674
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,960
have knowledge. Why? Because he understands that God's will is for saved

675
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,640
people to grow spiritually. Number three in our text of Scripture in 1st

676
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,320
Timothy chapter 2, I want you to see number three. God's will is for saved

677
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,960
people to share the gospel. God's will is for saved people to share the gospel. You

678
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,040
understand that lost people can't share the gospel? Why? Because they don't know

679
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,520
the gospel. In fact, when there was one that was possessed that said of Paul that

680
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,520
these are the men that show us the way of salvation, we find that Paul said, get

681
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,360
that, cast the demon out. Why? Because it was the wrong vessel. It was the right

682
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,480
message, but the wrong vessel. Notice back in our text in 1st Timothy chapter 2,

683
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,160
the Bible says in verse number 6, who gave himself a ransom for all. We

684
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,559
already mentioned that in our first thought this morning, that it is God's

685
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,080
will for lost people to be saved. But then notice the end of verse number 6, to

686
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,360
be testified in due time. The idea of this phrase here is that he would, the

687
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,600
Lord Jesus Christ, would be testified by those that know him at the appropriate

688
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,440
time. You know, God gives us opportunities, and we better be ready to share Christ,

689
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,480
to speak of the hope that lieth within you. Notice in verse number 7, Paul makes

690
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,640
the application personally to himself, where unto I am ordained a preacher and

691
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,040
an apostle. The office that he had was that of being an apostle, but he was

692
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,800
commissioned, just as each of us are commissioned, to be preachers of the

693
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,360
gospel. We find that Jesus said that we're to go and preach the gospel to

694
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,320
every creature. By the way, in Acts chapter number 8, at the height of the

695
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,839
persecution of the church in Jerusalem, they're scattered abroad because of the

696
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,320
persecution, and the Bible says, and they that were scattered abroad went

697
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:33,080
everywhere preaching the word. You know what's interesting about that? The

698
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,680
church leader stayed in Jerusalem. It was the people that went out and preached

699
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,000
the gospel, that preached the word. There's only so many people I come into

700
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,720
contact in any given week. There's only so many opportunities that I have to

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,279
preach the gospel. It is my duty, but it is your duty. Why? Because it is God's

702
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,720
will for saved people, not only to grow spiritually, but for saved people to

703
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,240
spread the gospel. We see, he says, that I am ordained a preacher and apostle. I

704
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,119
speak the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and

705
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,920
verity. And so we find that it is our responsibility, we understand this

706
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,720
morning, that God's desire is for his people to share the gospel. In Acts

707
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,920
chapter 5 in verse 32, we're not going to turn there, but the Bible says of the

708
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,040
disciples, they say this, we are his witnesses. By the way, it's a good way

709
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,320
for us to refer to ourselves. We are his witnesses. We are the ones that God has

710
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,119
entrusted to take the gospel to a lost and dying world. And we know that Paul

711
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,440
said, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why? For it, the gospel of Christ,

712
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,640
is the power of God unto salvation. Remember again, to everyone that

713
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,920
believeth. Why everyone? Why does he use that phrase? Well, because God's will is

714
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,240
for lost people to be saved. For all men. He gave himself a ransom for all. So

715
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,480
therefore, Paul is able to say that the gospel is the power of God unto

716
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,600
salvation to everyone, to any man, any person that would place their faith and

717
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,320
trust in Christ. And so we find that the Bible tells us in 2nd Corinthians

718
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,400
chapter 5 and verse number 20 that we are his ambassadors. It's kind of a

719
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,400
special title that God gives us as being his ambassadors. I read an account

720
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,080
recently of a, I don't remember exactly the name of the individual. I should have

721
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,559
jotted it down. I thought I remember it, but I can't remember the name of the

722
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:39,040
individual. But he was in charge of the government office in which the

723
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,239
ambassadors would leave from there, from the United States, and they'd go to

724
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,200
whatever country they were going to. And the first question that this individual

725
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,040
would ask as they would come into his office and they were preparing for

726
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,960
departure to go fulfill their duties as ambassador, is he would say this, what

727
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,520
country do you represent? And almost every single time the individual being

728
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,200
asked would answer the country that they were going to. And he would say, no, you

729
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:13,479
represent the United States of America. You are going to that foreign nation to

730
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:19,919
represent America. So what are we as ambassadors? Well, this world is not my

731
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:25,000
home. You know, as you can say, the Bible speaks about in Ephesians chapter 3

732
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,160
that our citizenship is in heaven. Amen? We sing, this world is not my home. I'm a

733
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,919
pilgrim. I'm a stranger. Hebrews chapter 3, 11. And the reality this morning is

734
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:43,000
that we are ambassadors. Why? Because our citizenship is in heaven. We have

735
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,080
citizenship here on earth, but we are ambassadors here. We are his

736
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:55,400
representatives. Our kingdom is heaven. Aren't you thankful for that, by the way?

737
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,679
What a unique opportunity that we have to be his witnesses, to be his

738
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,799
ambassadors. And we find that truth in Acts 5 and verse 32, in 2 Corinthians 5

739
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,640
and verse number 20.

740
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,640
We could take the time this morning to look at the Great Commission as it's given in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.

741
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:26,640
You see it over and over. God's will is for those that are saved to share the gospel, to spread the truth of the good news.

742
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,640
It's the greatest message that's ever been told.

743
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,640
But so often we shy away from sharing the gospel, and I'm guilty of it just as much as anyone else is,

744
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,640
because we're concerned of how it's going to be received.

745
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,640
God never gave us the responsibility of how someone responds to the message that we give.

746
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,640
In fact, the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ is when they don't listen to you, just shake off the dust and go to the next place.

747
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Is that not true?

748
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,640
So our duty, we find, is that we would understand the will of God.

749
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,640
In the midst of this, we've made application throughout the message this morning,

750
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,640
but we find with this third thought that God's will is for saved people to share the gospel.

751
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:19,640
The question this morning is how has that truth of knowing this morning God's will is for us to spread the gospel, to share the gospel,

752
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,640
how has that impacted our behavior?

753
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Someone asked this very simple question.

754
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Who gives out tracts?

755
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Do you know the answer to that?

756
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,640
The one that has them.

757
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Have you ever been in a situation where you thought the Holy Spirit of God was prompting you to give a tract and you didn't have one?

758
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Can I tell you something really frustrating?

759
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,640
I say it's frustrating because I was in Bible college.

760
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,640
When I was in Bible college, you had to wear a shirt and tie every day to class.

761
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
You had to wear a coat to chapel.

762
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
That was just the dress code.

763
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
That's what we had to do.

764
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:00,640
And so I wore a shirt and tie every day to class, and just as I still do today, I had gospel tracts in my pocket.

765
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I like wearing dress shirts.

766
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,640
I don't wear them all the time, but I like wearing them because it's an easy place to keep a gospel tract.

767
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,640
While I was in Bible college, I had students that made fun of me for carrying gospel tracts around.

768
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Can you just kind of shake your head and say, seriously?

769
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,640
I mean, isn't that what we're supposed to do?

770
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Try to share the gospel.

771
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:28,640
I understand that it doesn't end with just sharing a gospel tract, but there are some times where the only thing you might be able to do is share a gospel tract.

772
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,640
The person that's helping you at the counter is working a job.

773
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,640
And integrity would say that they have to be a good worker, right?

774
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,640
And you can't take 30 minutes of their time to try to share the gospel with them.

775
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,640
While the line backs up and they're—that's not right.

776
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,640
So, all you might be able to do is say, can I share this with you?

777
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,640
And I often say this, the content of this changed my life 25 years ago.

778
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Will you read it?

779
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,640
I try to get them to give me a commitment that they'll read it.

780
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,640
They have to answer the question.

781
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Now, some of us have all been to the same place, all being in Fairfax, where the person likes to take them and rip them up in your face.

782
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,640
It's happened multiple times to several of our members.

783
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,640
You know, it doesn't make me mad, it makes me sad.

784
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
It makes me sad.

785
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Something happened in that man's life, and I don't know what it is, but he's mad at God.

786
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
He's not really mad at me.

787
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,640
He's not mad at the other members of our church that have had that happen.

788
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Some have shared it with me.

789
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Have you ever given a tract?

790
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Have you ever been to Aldi?

791
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I have been.

792
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Have you ever given a tract?

793
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Yep, I know who you're talking about.

794
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,640
He followed me out the door and said, you're sure this is for me?

795
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Yeah.

796
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Right in my face.

797
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
It just broke my heart.

798
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm not mad at him.

799
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,640
He's rejecting Christ.

800
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:09,640
But how has the truth of God's will, that saved people to spread the gospel, to share the gospel, how has it impacted your behavior and my behavior?

801
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,640
How has it influenced my prayer life?

802
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Those are the two questions we've asked with each point this morning.

803
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,640
Let me share with you again Paul's example.

804
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
We've used that for the first and second point.

805
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I'll use it again for this third point this morning.

806
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,640
Look at Ephesians chapter 6.

807
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:39,640
I want you to see what Paul, it's very interesting that Paul, God allows for the prayers of Paul to be recorded in a number of portions.

808
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,640
There's a few times in which we read of Paul requesting prayer.

809
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:52,640
One of them is very basic where Paul simply says in 1 Thessalonians 5, brethren pray for us.

810
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,640
There's no specific details with regard to the prayer request.

811
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,640
But the example in Ephesians chapter 6, I want you to see this morning because we're going to look at Colossians as well and we'll be done.

812
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,640
But notice in Ephesians 6, notice what the Bible says in verse number 19.

813
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,640
He talks about in verse number 18 about the importance of praying.

814
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,640
But then he says in verse number 19, after he says pray for all saints, but he says and for me.

815
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:21,640
So Paul is giving the believers of Ephesus a personal prayer request in Ephesians 6.

816
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
And here's what the request is.

817
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,640
That utterance may be given unto me.

818
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,640
That I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel.

819
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:43,640
For which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

820
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,640
I know I've asked the question before but it begs to be asked again in this portion of scripture.

821
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Paul requesting for boldness.

822
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Is not Paul one of the most bold witnesses that you see as you read the New Testament?

823
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:09,640
I mean he stands in boldness before those in authority and he preaches the gospel.

824
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,640
But he asked people to pray for boldness.

825
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,640
That he would open his mouth and speak what he was supposed to speak.

826
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,640
The gospel.

827
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,640
That may be some insight as to how Paul was so bold.

828
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,640
He had people praying for him to be bold.

829
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
That was his request.

830
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,640
In Colossians chapter number 4 he says this in verse number 2 of Colossians 4.

831
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
He's speaking to these believers of Colossians.

832
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
He's already said how he's praying for them.

833
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
Now he's saying pray for me.

834
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Continue in prayer.

835
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
Verse number 2 of Colossians 4.

836
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
And watch in the same with thanksgiving with all.

837
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Praying also for us.

838
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
What's the prayer request?

839
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,640
That God would open us a door of utterance.

840
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Can I say it in this phrase?

841
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,640
That God would give us an opportunity.

842
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,640
And then he says this.

843
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
To speak the mystery of Christ.

844
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,640
For which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest.

845
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,640
Notice what he says.

846
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,640
As I ought to speak.

847
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:26,640
So Paul, understanding the will of God, has his behavior impacted.

848
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,640
How do we say that?

849
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,640
Well, Paul gets saved.

850
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
He understands that it was God's will for him to be saved.

851
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,640
He acts nine.

852
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,640
But then Paul is engaged in discipleship and helping people to grow.

853
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,640
Paul then is sharing the gospel.

854
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
Why?

855
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,640
Because that's God's will.

856
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:53,640
But his prayer life was influenced by these three thoughts that are given to us of God's will for humanity in 1st Timothy 2.

857
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,640
He prays for people, lost people, to be saved.

858
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,640
He prays for God's people, those that are saved, to be strengthened and to grow spiritually.

859
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
He prays that God would give him boldness.

860
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,640
And he asks others to pray that he would share the gospel as he ought.

861
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,640
So I simply ask this morning.

862
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,640
How has knowing God's will for humanity, God's revealed will, how has it impacted our behavior?

863
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
And how is it influencing our prayer life?

864
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Because in the midst of an exhortation on prayer, God seemingly gives us this parenthetical statement and says,

865
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,640
let me reveal to you my will for humanity.

866
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,640
Number one, it's for lost people to be saved.

867
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Number two, it's for saved people to grow spiritually.

868
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,640
And number three, it's for saved people to share the gospel.

869
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,640
I hope this morning that God's will impacts us.

870
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Impacts our behavior and influences our prayer lives.

871
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
Shall we pray?

872
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,640
Father, we love you.

873
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
We thank you for loving us.

874
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
Thank you for your word.

875
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,640
I thank you this morning that we do not have to reach our own conclusions with regard to your will for humanity.

876
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,640
That we can go to the written, preserved, inspired, preserved word of God.

877
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:20,640
You have communicated to us what your will is for humanity.

878
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:28,640
God, I pray this morning that we would be impacted and influenced by these truths.

879
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,640
If there's one that's not saved, I pray this morning they'd understand that it's your will for them to be saved today.

880
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Today is the day of salvation.

881
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Maybe for some that are saved, they're just kind of floundering around.

882
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
They're not really growing spiritually.

883
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,640
God, would you help them to recognize this morning that your will is for them to grow spiritually?

884
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
It's not enough to just be saved.

885
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
I mean, yes, they're going to heaven.

886
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,640
But God, you want them to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

887
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,640
God, would you help us to recognize this morning that your will is for us to share the gospel?

888
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:09,640
Would you help us to evaluate our lives and honestly, sincerely desire to be used of them?

889
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,880
me, to share the wonderful message of the gospel with those that we come in contact

890
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,880
with.

891
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,200
I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd move and work as only you can.

892
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,040
We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's

893
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,040
name we pray.

894
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
Would you stand with me?

895
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,800
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

896
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,560
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does the altar is open.
