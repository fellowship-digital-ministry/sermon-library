00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
special music this morning, I didn't want you to be afraid that I was going to sing

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:12.720
this morning, thus I shared with you my experience yesterday in kindly declining the opportunity

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.399
even there yesterday, but I will spare you this morning as well.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:23.799
First Timothy 2, verses 4 through 7, and thankful for God's Word, the Bible says this,

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:28.760
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.139
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, notice

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:43.560
verse 6, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, whereunto I am

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.759
ordained a preacher, an apostle, I speak the truth in Christ, and, lie not, a teacher of

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.360
the Gentiles in faith and verity.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.080
In the midst of this exhortation on prayer, remember he begins in verse number 1, I exhort

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.239
therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.160
be made for all men.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And then as we looked at it last week, the Holy Spirit of God zeroed in on this truth

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.199
for kings and for all that are in authority.

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:20.800
I hope you prayed for our leaders last week, and I mentioned to you that I jotted down

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
the names.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.040
One person contacted me for the websites that I referenced, and they said, well, that just

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.680
added 12 names to my prayer list, and I said, well, praise the Lord.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.599
And I prayed for our leaders this week by name, and I hope that you have as well.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:40.360
And we find that in the midst of this exhortation that God gives us on the subject matter of

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.279
prayer, right in the midst of it we find that God reveals His will for humanity.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.839
Often we hear people talk about God's will.

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:57.319
No doubt you've mentioned at some point the will of God or God's will, and we understand

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.680
what we mean by that.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.080
And I am thankful that God has preserved His word for us so that we can know His will.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.240
See, this morning we do not have to reach our own conclusions regarding the will of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240
God.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.619
We go to the Word of God, and we understand that in the Word of God, God has revealed

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:21.039
to us who He is, who we are, and what His will is for humanity.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.020
Knowing the will of God will impact how we behave.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.720
Knowing the will of God will impact how we behave.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.000
Knowing the will of God will impact our worldview.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.679
You know, there are people today, they talk about your worldview and seeking to influence

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:42.119
your worldview or shape or mold your worldview.

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.559
They'll use that type of terminology.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.179
Listen, it's the Bible, it's the will of God that should mold and shape our worldview.

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:56.080
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, it seems very obvious to me

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.020
that knowing the will of God will influence how we pray.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.860
Right in the midst of the exhortation on prayer, it's almost like it's a parenthetical statement

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.600
in verses 4 through 7, and in the midst of this exhortation on prayer, God reveals to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.440
us His will for humanity, why?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.240
Because God's will will influence how we pray.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.559
Knowing the will of God influences your prayer life and my prayer life.

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.160
Hold your place here, let me read to you 1 John chapter number 5.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.320
In 1 John chapter 5, many of us are familiar with verse number 13, and speaking about the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.619
assurance of salvation and what a precious verse that is.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:47.679
But in 1 John chapter 5, in verse number 14, the Bible says this, and this is the confidence

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:59.460
that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.779
And if we know that He heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.380
that we desired of Him.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.759
And so we find that in 1 John 5, 14, we have this truth of we're to pray according to the

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.139
will of God.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.260
And so in the midst of this exhortation on prayer, God reveals to us His will for humanity.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.679
I've titled the message, as you see in the bulletin this morning, God's will for humanity.

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:29.820
As we look at these few verses of Scripture, I want to share three thoughts with you this

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.779
morning from this portion of Scripture that I believe God is giving us that will help

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:44.380
us shape our worldview, influence our behavior, and influence our prayer lives when we understand

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.220
this is God's will.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.299
With me this morning, notice number one, if you will.

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:55.579
God's will is for lost people to be saved.

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:59.940
God's will is for lost people to be saved.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.100
Have you ever prayed or have you ever heard someone pray, Lord, if it would be your will,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.100
would you save them?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.500
No, you don't need to pray that way.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.579
We know that it's God's will.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.619
God does not arbitrarily save them.

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.739
They have to accept the gift that He offers.

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:21.559
But we can be confident this morning that it is God's will that lost people are saved.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.059
Why do we go and preach the gospel?

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:24.500
Why do we pass out gospel tracts?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.179
Why do we, well, because we know it's God's will for lost people to be saved.

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:31.179
Remember this morning, there are two groups of people in the world.

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:34.540
There are people that are lost and there are people that are saved.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.100
As you boil it all down, if you look at it all, you come to the very end of it, you say

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.339
there are two groups of people in the world, saved people and lost people.

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.899
Those of us this morning, I'm in the category of being saved, amen?

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.700
I've been saved by the blood of Christ.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.619
Heaven is my home, no doubt about it.

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:53.820
Jesus is mine, I am His, hallelujah.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.899
I am so thankful for the truth of salvation.

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:01.739
I've been born again by the Spirit of God through the blood of Christ.

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.100
Praise the Lord for knowing that you're saved.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.380
But remember, for every one of us this morning that are saved, there was a time that we were

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.679
lost.

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:15.739
So everyone that's in that category of being saved, at one point you were in the category

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:16.739
of being lost.

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:20.619
And if you say, no, I was born saved, you need to be saved.

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.779
You need to be born again, amen?

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.820
On the authority of God's Word, why?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.820
Because you're not born saved, you're born lost.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.940
You're born at enmity with God.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.059
In fact, Ephesians chapter number two explains that in great detail with regard to we all

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.299
had our conversation in times past.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:44.799
We all were in that same condition of being lost.

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:49.700
But we notice here in this portion of Scripture, in verse number four, notice what the Bible

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.619
says in 1 Timothy 2 and verse number four, who will have, notice what it says, all men

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:01.579
to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:08.179
Why do I say this is God's will for the humanity when we look at God's will for lost people

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:09.179
to be saved?

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.940
Because it says, who will have all men to be saved.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.779
Now it doesn't mean that all men are going to be saved.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:20.019
It simply means that his will is for all men to be saved.

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:26.019
There's not one person that can stand at the great white throne judgment of God and say,

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.899
you were not willing to save me.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.179
Not one person can stand there and say that.

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:34.859
No, Jesus died for the world.

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:39.140
In fact, look at verse number six, who gave himself a ransom.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.579
What does it say?

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:41.579
For all.

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:42.579
For how many?

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:43.579
For all.

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:46.540
And we see in verse number four, who will have how many men?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.540
All men.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.059
Verse number six, who gave himself a ransom for how many?

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.459
For all to be testified in due time.

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:57.739
And so we find in verse number four, and again in verse number six, this word all that is

00:07:57.739 --> 00:08:00.059
so important for us to understand.

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:04.660
And we find that God says that he will have all men to be saved.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.859
He gave himself Jesus Christ when he hung upon the cross of Calvary.

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:12.299
He was paying for the sin of humanity.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.980
He was paying for your sin, and for my sin, and for your neighbor's sin, and for your

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.019
parents' sin, and your children's sin, and your…

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.940
He was paying for the sin of mankind.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.200
By the way, we find that Calvinism with its teaching of unconditional election and a limited

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.500
atonement are exposed as being false teaching by these simple verses of Scripture.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.580
I want you to understand this morning, and I know it's not popular, but it's biblical

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.780
that this idea of Calvinism is creeping into our churches all across this land.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.219
It's creeping into our Bible colleges, into our seminaries, and it's creeping into the

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:51.559
pews and into the pulpits of America.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:54.059
It's a problem.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:58.859
The reason that it's a problem is because Calvinism doesn't align with the Bible.

00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:03.239
And let me tell you, you can go to the internet and you can find a lot of Calvinistic preachers.

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:06.380
You can find a lot of them that align with Calvinism.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.299
And the problem is that the Bible teaches something different.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.619
The Bible doesn't teach unconditional election.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.780
The Bible doesn't teach limited atonement.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.140
We're not looking at all of the tenets, if you will, of Calvinism, but in just three

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.919
verses of Scripture, those two tenets are exposed as being false teaching.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:31.260
And we find that what happens is Calvinists have to get very creative, and they say, well,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.659
all doesn't really mean all.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.979
You'll hear that repeatedly.

00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:40.940
When you look at Ephesians chapter number one, understand with me this morning, we do

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.900
not have to be afraid of the Word that God uses in His Word.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.859
Look at it actually with me in Ephesians 1.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.859
We don't have to be fearful of this.

00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:56.219
We do not have to be fearful of using the Word predestinated.

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.700
God's Word uses that Word.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.700
But we have to be afraid of the Word that God uses in His Word.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.380
have to understand the context of what God uses it with.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.060
In Ephesians chapter one, notice the Bible says

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.140
in verse number three,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.860
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.780
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.100
and heavenly places in Christ.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.140
Notice verse four.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.540
According as he hath chosen us in him

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.220
before the foundation of the world,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.900
that we should be holy without blame before him in love.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.900
So we look at the idea of the choosing.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.460
Again, they'll use that idea of unconditional election.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.220
He says that he chose us in him

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.660
before the foundation of the world.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.580
Don't get afraid.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.500
Don't think this is unconditional election

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.660
because he says that we should be holy without blame.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.020
That is God's will for God's people.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.660
Those that get saved is that we would be holy

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.140
and without blame before him in love.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.220
Notice in verse five,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.100
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.660
notice what it says,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.820
by Jesus Christ to himself

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.020
according to the good pleasure of his will.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.900
What happens in Ephesians one

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.900
is they use the word choose and predestinate it

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.820
and they run with Calvinism.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.460
But the problem is that Ephesians one

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.220
is not talking about the who of salvation.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.660
Not at all.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.500
Ephesians one is talking about the how of salvation.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.300
You know, Tim, what God determined

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.780
before the foundation of the world,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.380
he determined there's only one way to be saved.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.740
That's through Jesus Christ.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.780
That's why Peter is able to say

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.820
that Jesus is the lamb that was slain

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.660
before the foundation of the world.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.500
Amen?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.860
Because God predetermined,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.860
he predestined the how of salvation.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.340
It would be through Jesus Christ.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.060
By the way, if you look at the Old Testament,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.300
you look at so many things that happen in the Old Testament,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.100
what's happening is it's a, really,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.780
it's a spiritual war that's going against

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.700
trying to destroy the messianic line

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.620
so that Jesus can't come.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.980
But greater is he that is in us.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.740
Listen, God is omnipotent.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.780
We have an enemy who's powerful,

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.700
but God is all powerful.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.460
And Messiah came.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.740
Aren't you thankful?

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.060
And he went to the cross

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.300
and he shed his blood for all of humanity.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.540
And God's will, we can say with confidence this morning,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.540
that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.860
And the truth, don't be afraid of Ephesians 1.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.420
Don't be afraid of Romans 9 and 10.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.620
We don't have to fear it.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.660
We just have to understand what God is saying in his word.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.980
And he's saying, listen,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.500
there's only one way to be saved, through Jesus Christ.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.700
Notice with me, though,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.740
that it's not just this portion of scripture

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.940
that reveals to us God's will for lost people to be saved.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.900
Take your Bible and turn over.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.020
Well, actually, you're probably still there

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.460
in 1 Timothy chapter two.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.420
Look at chapter one just for a moment.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.140
We mentioned this passage of scripture a few weeks ago.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.980
And look at verses 15 and 16.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.500
In 1 Timothy one, verses 15 and 16,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.860
notice what Paul says,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.700
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.860
This is a faithful saying, a truthful saying,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.020
and worthy of all acceptation.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.140
What is this saying?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.140
Well, that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.700
to save sinners.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.900
Amen?

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.980
Then he says this, of whom I am chief.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.300
Now, notice verse 16,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.860
how be it for this cause I obtain mercy

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.100
that in me first Jesus Christ

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.620
might show forth all longsuffering

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.940
for a pattern to them,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.340
which should hereafter believe on him

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.580
to life everlasting.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.540
In Ephesians one, the same portion of scripture,

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.700
we're not gonna go back there,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.340
but it says later on in chapter number one,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.380
in whom you trusted after you believed.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.500
And so they heard, or after you heard,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.620
they heard the truth of the gospel,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.060
Paul comes in and preaches,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.540
and they believe it, they accept Christ,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.420
and they're born again.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.700
They're adopted in the family of God.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.340
And so we find that Paul says

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.220
that Christ Jesus came to save sinners,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.180
of whom I am chief,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.860
and then there's this pattern

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.860
for those that would believe on him

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.820
to life everlasting.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.059
By the way, if you look at verse 16,

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:28.020
and really carry out the thought of it,

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.740
he has us in mind.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:32.900
Because we heard and we believed,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.580
if you're saved here this morning,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.059
the truth of 2 Peter chapter three in verse nine.

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:38.380
Maybe you wanna jot it down.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.140
The Bible says that the Lord

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.779
is longsuffering to us, word,

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:43.940
not willing that any should perish.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.740
It begins, the Lord is not slack

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.940
concerning his promise to us, word,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.500
as some men count slackness.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.340
What are they talking about?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.420
Well, some say, no, he's not gonna come back.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.420
Where is the promise of his coming?

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.900
That's how 2 Peter three,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.540
with those scoffers and mockers,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.940
and that's what's being dealt with.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.420
And then Peter says,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.860
the Lord is not slack

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.380
concerning his promise to us, word,

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.620
as some men count slackness.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.460
But what?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.900
He's longsuffering to us, word.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.380
Notice, not willing that any should perish,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.540
but that all should come to repentance.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.860
But I want you to see it in 1 John chapter two.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.140
Turn over there if you will.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.300
In 1 John chapter two,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.420
as you're turning there,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.140
I wanna remind you of a familiar verse of scripture

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.180
that many of us could quote this morning,

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.540
and that's John 3, 16.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.980
For God so loved, what?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.820
The world.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.779
For God so loved the world that he, what?

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:40.140
He gave his only begotten son,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.380
that whosoever, don't you like that word?

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.900
Whosoever will may come.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.740
We sing the song.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.020
What a wonderful song it is.

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:51.860
Whosoever shall believe.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.779
Right, what are they gonna have?

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:54.540
Everlasting life.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.340
For God so loved the world that he gave

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.700
his only begotten son,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.340
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.420
but have everlasting life.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.860
So again, when those that would follow

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.380
the tenets of Calvinism would say,

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.260
well, all doesn't really mean all.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.340
It just means all of the elect.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.500
So then when you say, well, John 3, 16 says,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.660
for God so loved the world,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.059
they say, yeah, it doesn't really mean world

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:19.779
as in including everybody.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.380
It just means the elect world.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.260
But I want you to notice what the Bible says in 1 John.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.340
I love God's word.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.700
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.500
And in 1 John 2, it's a precious truth

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.460
that God gives us in verse number one,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.500
that Jesus is our advocate.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.779
Praise God for that.

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:40.500
And it says this in verse number one,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.580
my little children, these things have I write unto you,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.460
that you sin not.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.860
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.620
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.540
Notice what it says, and he, who is he?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.500
Well, Jesus Christ, our advocate.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:00.340
And he is the propitiation for our sins.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.340
Literally the truth of the covering, the blood,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.420
the atonement, the mercy seat is in view,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.420
he satisfied the demand for sin, the penalty.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.620
So he is the propitiation for our sins.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.140
Now, John is writing in 1 John to save people, amen?

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.980
He's writing to save people.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.100
So he says, he is the propitiation for our sins.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.140
Now, we believe that this morning,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.620
but we believe that God's will is for all people to be saved,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.940
that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.940
Notice what he says, and not for ours only,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.260
but also for the sins of the whole world.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.500
I'm thankful this morning that God's will

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.540
is for lost people to be saved.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.580
Why am I thankful for that?

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.540
Because I used to be a lost person, amen?

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.420
And God saved me by his amazing grace.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.740
And what a blessing.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.940
And I want you to understand this morning,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.059
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:12.940
knowing the will of God will shape our worldview.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.460
It will impact our behavior,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.500
but it will also influence our prayer.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.300
It's this parenthetical statement

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.460
in 1 Timothy chapter two,

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.540
in the midst of an exhortation on prayer,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.460
that God reveals his plan, his will for humanity.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.140
And the first aspect is for lost people to be saved.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.400
How does that influence my prayer life?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.640
Paul says this in Romans chapter 10.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.600
I think it's a great example for us to know

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.320
as we think about how this parenthetical statement

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.080
of giving to us God's will for humanity

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.960
in the midst of an exhortation on prayer

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.880
reveals how knowing God's will influences my prayer life.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.880
Here's what Paul says in Romans 10 in verse one.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.679
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.520
to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600
So that's a prayer request,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.280
that's a prayer of Paul's

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.760
that's influenced by knowing the will of God.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.679
Amen?

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.720
And so when we look at this portion of scripture

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.239
this morning and we make application for our lives,

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.919
we know that God's will is for lost people to be saved.

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:37.960
But how has that influenced me?

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.880
If I know that it's God's will for lost people to be saved,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.919
then I ought to be active in sharing the gospel.

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:44.760
Amen?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.040
It means that I ought to be praying for people to be saved.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.720
Because knowing the will of God influences my prayer life.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.480
Notice with me number two this morning,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.359
not only is God's will for lost people to be saved,

00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:01.119
but number two, back in 1 Timothy chapter

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:06.960
number two, God's will for lost people to be saved.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.960
God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.040
God's will is for lost people to be saved,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.040
but then God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.900
We find in our text of scripture, again,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.280
in 1 Timothy chapter two,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.180
notice what the Bible says in verse number four,

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.780
who will have all men to be saved,

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.040
but then it says this,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.380
and to come under the knowledge of the truth.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.080
And then verse number five, again,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.420
I'm thankful for this wonderful promise or truth

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.780
that God reveals to us.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.880
Notice it says, for there's one God

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.280
and one mediator between God and men,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.000
the man, Christ, Jesus.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
This exposes the teaching

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
that you have to go through some priest to get to God.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.600
I'm thankful that we are priests of God

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.840
and we can go direct access to the throne of heaven.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.100
That is an amazing privilege, by the way.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.840
And when we look at verse four and five,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.300
and we consider the thought this morning

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.180
that God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.340
we understand two aspects here

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.980
of that growing in the knowledge of the truth.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.820
It says, and to have to come

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.420
unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.660
Where do I get that from?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.420
Well, God's word is truth.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.320
He says, sanctify them through thy word.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.360
Thy word is truth.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.700
And so we understand that we're to grow by this book

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.560
and this book will grow us up in our faith,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.220
but we also understand the aspect,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.320
according to verse number five, of prayer.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.700
Prayer.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.420
You know, as you grow spiritually,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.580
you're gonna learn more about this book

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.300
and you're gonna grow in your prayer life.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.180
And those things work together.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.780
In fact, we sing a song with our children in VBS

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.780
and in Children's Church.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.660
Read your Bible, pray every day,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.380
and you'll grow, grow, grow, right?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.480
Many of you have heard the song.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.860
Maybe you've had the opportunity

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.660
to hear us sing it at some point,

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.060
but we sing that with the children.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.900
Why?

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.020
Because we understand that reading and praying,

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.380
reading God's word and praying

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.740
helps us to grow spiritually.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.860
And it is God's will for lost people to be saved,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.040
but then not to just, okay, I'm saved.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.740
No, now God's will for you

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.220
when you leave the category of being lost

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.260
to going into the category of being saved,

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.660
God's will is for you to grow spiritually.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.900
We know that here from 1 Timothy 2,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.120
but notice with me a few other verses of Scripture.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.480
Turn over to Hebrews 5, if you will.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.480
Hebrews 5, and really,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.640
this is an interesting passage of Scripture

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.200
where Paul speaks to these.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.880
I believe Paul wrote the book of Hebrews.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.960
The Bible college answer is God wrote it

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.080
because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.160
People debate over it,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.960
but I believe Paul was the human penman.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.080
But the reality is that here,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.640
and then also in 1 Corinthians 11,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.340
two times the verbiage isn't used here,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.680
but it's as if Paul is saying

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.900
he uses this verbiage in 1 Corinthians 11.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.460
I praise you not.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.060
Like, I'm not commending you for this.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.380
This, in fact, I'm speaking really to your shame.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.460
What is it that he speaks of?

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.140
Well, notice with me in Hebrews 5 in verse number 11.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.340
He says, of whom we have many things to say

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.320
and hard to be uttered.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.860
Why are they hard to be uttered?

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.100
Well, not because I don't understand them,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.440
not because I don't know how to communicate them,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.700
but because ye are dull of hearing.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.940
So Paul says, this is difficult

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.020
because we have many things to say,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.020
we have many things to teach you,

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.900
but you're dull of hearing.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.780
And notice in verse number 12, he says,

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.520
for when for the time you ought to be teachers.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.320
That means that they'd been saved for a while.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.420
They'd left the category of being lost and being saved

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.180
and they're to grow spiritually.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.660
He says, in the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.740
ye have need that one teach you again,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.160
which be the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.400
There becomes such as have need of milk

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.320
and not of strong meat.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.560
And that reminds us of the truth of 1 Peter 2

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.400
in verse number two.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.880
The Bible says, as newborn babes,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.440
desire the sincere milk of the word

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.720
that ye may grow thereby.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720
And so listen, it's not a bad thing

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.400
to need the milk of the word.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.860
That's where we all begin.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.360
But I'm so thankful.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.220
Physically, I'm thankful I'm not still on a milk diet.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.140
Hallelujah.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.100
But spiritually, we ought not be on a milk diet.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.620
We're to grow.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.880
Amen.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.700
And so he says, notice he says,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.700
that ye have need of milk and not of strong meat.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.360
Notice verse 13, for everyone that useth milk

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.300
is unskillful in the word of righteousness,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.820
for he is a babe.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.220
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.620
even those who by reason of use

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.840
have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.440
Now here's the amazing thing spiritually.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.040
You don't have to be saved for a certain period of time

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.700
in order to be a mature Christian.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.340
So physically speaking, there are certain things

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.840
that a baby cannot eat.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.960
They have to be on a milk diet for a certain period of time,

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.800
and then everything they eat is pureed.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.400
Isn't that awful?

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.040
I mean, honestly.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.040
I am not interested in eating baby food.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.400
Julianna's been feeding some baby food to Nova.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.720
No thank you.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720
I've not offered to taste it.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.900
I don't wanna smell it.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.440
I like my food the way I eat it, amen.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.320
But physically, Nova can't handle the piece of chicken

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.760
that I eat or the green bean that I eat, right?

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.120
She can't handle it.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480
And so there's a, we understand that physically,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.600
but spiritually, you can be mature

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.140
and not be very quote-unquote old in the Lord.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.100
Why do I say that?

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.660
Well, because you're as close to God,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.760
you're as mature spiritually as you really wanna be.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.380
We, this past week, we've read our Bibles

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.020
as much as we've really wanted to.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.340
We've prayed as much as we've really wanted to.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.660
We've engaged, listen, it's a desire that we have,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.480
that we wanna grow.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.860
He says, as newborn babies, desire,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.900
this is the same miracle of the word,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.240
that ye may grow thereby.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.300
But then we are to grow beyond that.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.980
We're to get into the meat of the word of God.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.700
We find that 2 Peter 3, in verse number 18,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.660
here's what God says, and it's a great ending

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.260
to the book of 2 Peter, but grow in grace

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.060
in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.700
To him be glory, both now and forever, amen.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.820
You know what the best remedy is for false teaching?

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.280
Spiritual growth, spiritual growth.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.560
Because when you grow spiritually,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.240
when you get into this book, when you grow,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.680
you can expose false teaching.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.320
You can identify false teaching.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.660
You can see it, because you're growing spiritually.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.320
And so we find that God's will, number one,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.760
is for lost people to be saved,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.080
but God's will, number two,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.120
is for saved people to grow spiritually.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.960
So just as we made application with the first truth,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.920
we make application with the second truth.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.740
What are we doing personally to grow spiritually?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.180
How, maybe I can ask it this way,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.960
what are we doing to help someone else grow spiritually?

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.040
What are we doing to help somebody else grow spiritually?

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.780
You know, Nova can't feed herself right now.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.980
If you can't feed yourself right now,

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.020
somebody, you have, you've broken something,

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.420
you have a, but she physically cannot

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.620
feed herself right now.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.800
You know, the reality is that spiritually speaking,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.360
there's some babes in Christ that need a mature brother

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.560
or sister to come alongside and help them to grow.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.320
You ever know the phrase, we use it,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.200
they're spoon-fed, right?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.600
Why, because they can't feed themselves.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.360
So I don't know where you were when you first got saved,

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.920
but I know when I first got saved,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.640
I didn't know anything about this book.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.000
I didn't know where to begin.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.240
I didn't know what, I didn't know anything.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.620
And so I'm thankful that there were some spiritual leaders

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.220
in my life that came alongside

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.980
and helped me to grow spiritually.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.180
By the way, that's the fulfilling of the Great Commission,

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.100
not only to preach the gospel and to baptize them,

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.980
but to disciple them.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.780
And we find here that we are to be engaged in ourselves.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.940
What are we doing to grow?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.200
Don't be comfortable and content with where you are.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.140
The Christian life is very interesting.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.020
There really is no time that you're stagnant

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.380
in the Christian life.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.800
You're either going forward or you're going backward.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.160
Seriously.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.119
Don't be content with where you are.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:53.520
Desire, as Paul, I think about Paul.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.080
For many of us, in 1 Timothy, he says,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.280
I'm the chief of all sinners.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.800
But for many of us, we have Paul in our minds

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.920
as this great Christian,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.960
and he certainly was a man that followed God.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.800
He's a man that we can learn much from.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.280
But you know what Paul says in Philippians 3?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.440
That I may know him.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.520
He wasn't content with where he was.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.880
He wanted to grow more.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.679
He wanted to learn more about his Lord and his Savior.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.260
Not only did we say that we should be engaged

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.660
in seeking how God's will, how has it affected my behavior,

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.940
but we said it should affect our prayer lives.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.980
It's within this exhortation on prayer

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.940
that God reveals his will for humanity.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.100
And I want you to understand

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.200
that in Ephesians chapter number three,

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:38.900
Paul is praying for the believers in Ephesus.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.420
In Ephesians chapter number three,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.559
as Paul is praying for the believers in Ephesus,

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:46.440
it's very interesting because Paul is praying

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.160
that these believers in Ephesus

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.100
would be strengthened spiritually, that they would grow.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.280
Notice with me, beginning in verse number 14 of Ephesians 3.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.080
See, Paul is praying for these believers in Ephesus

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.040
according to the will of God.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.280
And it says in Ephesians 3 and verse 14,

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.920
for this cause I bow my knees unto the Father

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.760
of our Lord.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.720
Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is name, that

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.840
he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, notice, to be

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.200
strengthened with might by his Spirit, where? In the inner man. Listen, we need

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.040
to be praying that way one for another. So often our prayer requests one for

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.880
another are physical, but we need to be praying spiritually for our brothers and

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.960
sisters in Christ. We, listen, we're engaged in spiritual battle and

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.520
spiritual warfare, and we need to be strengthened in our inner man. We find

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.120
that he says that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.800
rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.200
the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ,

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:54.320
which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God. Why

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.240
is Paul praying this way? Well, because he understands God's will is for saved

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.320
people to grow spiritually. Paul has grown, and Paul says, I want these

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.440
believers in Ephesus to grow spiritually, so I'm praying for them. He prays for the

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.280
believers in Colossae in Colossians chapter number one. Now it's interesting

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.200
because in Ephesians chapter 3, Paul had a personal relationship with these

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.480
people. He knew the people at the church at Ephesus. He had ministered there, but

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.600
now when we come to the book of Colossians, Paul did not minister there.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.280
He did not. God didn't use Paul to start the church in Colossae, but he heard

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.000
about their faith, and what does he do? He begins to pray for them. And notice with me

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.560
in Colossians 1, how does Paul pray for these believers in Colossae? Well, in

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.280
verse number 9, it says, for this cause we also, notice what he says, since the day

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:48.000
we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.960
with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.200
ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.320
good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. I won't read the rest

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.400
of the prayer, but this is biblical praying. And it's praying according to

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.000
the will of God, because God's will is not simply that lost people are saved,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.400
but God's will is that saved people grow spiritually. We ought to be praying. You

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.880
know, sometimes, you know, God uses a variety of things to grow us. Some things,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.760
sometimes, God uses the things that we dislike the most to grow us. Amen?

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.880
Sometimes, God will put somebody in your life to grow you. The person that you

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:48.120
want to get, you understand what I'm saying? They bother you. God says, I'm

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.280
helping you grow. The psalmist says in Psalm 119, it was good for me to be

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.320
afflicted. I don't know about you, but I don't like affliction. But he says, it's good

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.680
for me, because then I learned thy statutes. I grew. Listen, David, he was, he

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:13.440
was displeased when Uzzah touched the ark and he died. But you know what

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:20.640
happened in that tragedy? David grew. David grew. He found out we better do

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:27.960
God's work God's way. And guess what? When they brought the ark the second time,

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.960
when they took it out of the house where it was stored for three months, they did

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:42.520
it the right way. They did it God's way. And so we find here that we're to pray

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.200
God. Listen, sometimes we pray someone's dealing with a trial and affliction and

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.600
we pray for them in that trial or affliction, which is great, it's

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.920
commendable, but don't stop too short. What do I mean by that? Well, maybe you need to add

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.480
this to the prayer. God, in that, would you help them to grow spiritually? Would you

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:13.720
help them to learn more about you? That's praying biblically. So God's

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:20.000
will, when we understand it, it impacts our behavior. It influences our worldview, but

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.279
it also influences how we pray. We see that Paul says, I'm praying for my

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:29.720
brethren that they would be saved. Why? Because he understands God's will is for

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.000
lost people to be saved. We find that Paul is praying for those in Ephesus and

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.839
those in Colossae that they would grow spiritually, that they'd be strengthened, they would

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:42.960
have knowledge. Why? Because he understands that God's will is for saved

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.640
people to grow spiritually. Number three in our text of Scripture in 1st

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.320
Timothy chapter 2, I want you to see number three. God's will is for saved

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.960
people to share the gospel. God's will is for saved people to share the gospel. You

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.040
understand that lost people can't share the gospel? Why? Because they don't know

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.520
the gospel. In fact, when there was one that was possessed that said of Paul that

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.520
these are the men that show us the way of salvation, we find that Paul said, get

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.360
that, cast the demon out. Why? Because it was the wrong vessel. It was the right

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.480
message, but the wrong vessel. Notice back in our text in 1st Timothy chapter 2,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.160
the Bible says in verse number 6, who gave himself a ransom for all. We

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.559
already mentioned that in our first thought this morning, that it is God's

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:32.080
will for lost people to be saved. But then notice the end of verse number 6, to

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.360
be testified in due time. The idea of this phrase here is that he would, the

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.600
Lord Jesus Christ, would be testified by those that know him at the appropriate

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.440
time. You know, God gives us opportunities, and we better be ready to share Christ,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:54.480
to speak of the hope that lieth within you. Notice in verse number 7, Paul makes

00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.640
the application personally to himself, where unto I am ordained a preacher and

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.040
an apostle. The office that he had was that of being an apostle, but he was

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.800
commissioned, just as each of us are commissioned, to be preachers of the

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.360
gospel. We find that Jesus said that we're to go and preach the gospel to

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.320
every creature. By the way, in Acts chapter number 8, at the height of the

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.839
persecution of the church in Jerusalem, they're scattered abroad because of the

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:25.320
persecution, and the Bible says, and they that were scattered abroad went

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:33.080
everywhere preaching the word. You know what's interesting about that? The

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:39.680
church leader stayed in Jerusalem. It was the people that went out and preached

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:44.000
the gospel, that preached the word. There's only so many people I come into

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.720
contact in any given week. There's only so many opportunities that I have to

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.279
preach the gospel. It is my duty, but it is your duty. Why? Because it is God's

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.720
will for saved people, not only to grow spiritually, but for saved people to

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.240
spread the gospel. We see, he says, that I am ordained a preacher and apostle. I

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.119
speak the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:12.920
verity. And so we find that it is our responsibility, we understand this

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.720
morning, that God's desire is for his people to share the gospel. In Acts

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.920
chapter 5 in verse 32, we're not going to turn there, but the Bible says of the

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.040
disciples, they say this, we are his witnesses. By the way, it's a good way

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.320
for us to refer to ourselves. We are his witnesses. We are the ones that God has

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:41.119
entrusted to take the gospel to a lost and dying world. And we know that Paul

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:45.440
said, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why? For it, the gospel of Christ,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.640
is the power of God unto salvation. Remember again, to everyone that

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.920
believeth. Why everyone? Why does he use that phrase? Well, because God's will is

00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:00.240
for lost people to be saved. For all men. He gave himself a ransom for all. So

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.480
therefore, Paul is able to say that the gospel is the power of God unto

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.600
salvation to everyone, to any man, any person that would place their faith and

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.320
trust in Christ. And so we find that the Bible tells us in 2nd Corinthians

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.400
chapter 5 and verse number 20 that we are his ambassadors. It's kind of a

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:25.400
special title that God gives us as being his ambassadors. I read an account

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:31.080
recently of a, I don't remember exactly the name of the individual. I should have

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.559
jotted it down. I thought I remember it, but I can't remember the name of the

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:39.040
individual. But he was in charge of the government office in which the

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.239
ambassadors would leave from there, from the United States, and they'd go to

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:46.200
whatever country they were going to. And the first question that this individual

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.040
would ask as they would come into his office and they were preparing for

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.960
departure to go fulfill their duties as ambassador, is he would say this, what

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.520
country do you represent? And almost every single time the individual being

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:05.200
asked would answer the country that they were going to. And he would say, no, you

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:13.479
represent the United States of America. You are going to that foreign nation to

00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:19.919
represent America. So what are we as ambassadors? Well, this world is not my

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:25.000
home. You know, as you can say, the Bible speaks about in Ephesians chapter 3

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.160
that our citizenship is in heaven. Amen? We sing, this world is not my home. I'm a

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.919
pilgrim. I'm a stranger. Hebrews chapter 3, 11. And the reality this morning is

00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:43.000
that we are ambassadors. Why? Because our citizenship is in heaven. We have

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.080
citizenship here on earth, but we are ambassadors here. We are his

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:55.400
representatives. Our kingdom is heaven. Aren't you thankful for that, by the way?

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:01.679
What a unique opportunity that we have to be his witnesses, to be his

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:06.799
ambassadors. And we find that truth in Acts 5 and verse 32, in 2 Corinthians 5

00:40:06.799 --> 00:40:09.640
and verse number 20.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:15.640
We could take the time this morning to look at the Great Commission as it's given in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:26.640
You see it over and over. God's will is for those that are saved to share the gospel, to spread the truth of the good news.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.640
It's the greatest message that's ever been told.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.640
But so often we shy away from sharing the gospel, and I'm guilty of it just as much as anyone else is,

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.640
because we're concerned of how it's going to be received.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:46.640
God never gave us the responsibility of how someone responds to the message that we give.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:53.640
In fact, the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ is when they don't listen to you, just shake off the dust and go to the next place.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.640
Is that not true?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.640
So our duty, we find, is that we would understand the will of God.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.640
In the midst of this, we've made application throughout the message this morning,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.640
but we find with this third thought that God's will is for saved people to share the gospel.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:19.640
The question this morning is how has that truth of knowing this morning God's will is for us to spread the gospel, to share the gospel,

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.640
how has that impacted our behavior?

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.640
Someone asked this very simple question.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.640
Who gives out tracts?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640
Do you know the answer to that?

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.640
The one that has them.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:39.640
Have you ever been in a situation where you thought the Holy Spirit of God was prompting you to give a tract and you didn't have one?

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.640
Can I tell you something really frustrating?

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.640
I say it's frustrating because I was in Bible college.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.640
When I was in Bible college, you had to wear a shirt and tie every day to class.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640
You had to wear a coat to chapel.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640
That was just the dress code.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.640
That's what we had to do.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:00.640
And so I wore a shirt and tie every day to class, and just as I still do today, I had gospel tracts in my pocket.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640
I like wearing dress shirts.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.640
I don't wear them all the time, but I like wearing them because it's an easy place to keep a gospel tract.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:11.640
While I was in Bible college, I had students that made fun of me for carrying gospel tracts around.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.640
Can you just kind of shake your head and say, seriously?

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.640
I mean, isn't that what we're supposed to do?

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640
Try to share the gospel.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:28.640
I understand that it doesn't end with just sharing a gospel tract, but there are some times where the only thing you might be able to do is share a gospel tract.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.640
The person that's helping you at the counter is working a job.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.640
And integrity would say that they have to be a good worker, right?

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.640
And you can't take 30 minutes of their time to try to share the gospel with them.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.640
While the line backs up and they're—that's not right.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.640
So, all you might be able to do is say, can I share this with you?

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640
And I often say this, the content of this changed my life 25 years ago.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.640
Will you read it?

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.640
I try to get them to give me a commitment that they'll read it.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.640
They have to answer the question.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:14.640
Now, some of us have all been to the same place, all being in Fairfax, where the person likes to take them and rip them up in your face.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.640
It's happened multiple times to several of our members.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.640
You know, it doesn't make me mad, it makes me sad.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.640
It makes me sad.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.640
Something happened in that man's life, and I don't know what it is, but he's mad at God.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.640
He's not really mad at me.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.640
He's not mad at the other members of our church that have had that happen.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640
Some have shared it with me.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640
Have you ever given a tract?

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.640
Have you ever been to Aldi?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.640
I have been.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640
Have you ever given a tract?

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.640
Yep, I know who you're talking about.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.640
He followed me out the door and said, you're sure this is for me?

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640
Yeah.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.640
Right in my face.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.640
It just broke my heart.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640
I'm not mad at him.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.640
He's rejecting Christ.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:09.640
But how has the truth of God's will, that saved people to spread the gospel, to share the gospel, how has it impacted your behavior and my behavior?

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.640
How has it influenced my prayer life?

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.640
Those are the two questions we've asked with each point this morning.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.640
Let me share with you again Paul's example.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.640
We've used that for the first and second point.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.640
I'll use it again for this third point this morning.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.640
Look at Ephesians chapter 6.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:39.640
I want you to see what Paul, it's very interesting that Paul, God allows for the prayers of Paul to be recorded in a number of portions.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.640
There's a few times in which we read of Paul requesting prayer.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:52.640
One of them is very basic where Paul simply says in 1 Thessalonians 5, brethren pray for us.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.640
There's no specific details with regard to the prayer request.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.640
But the example in Ephesians chapter 6, I want you to see this morning because we're going to look at Colossians as well and we'll be done.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.640
But notice in Ephesians 6, notice what the Bible says in verse number 19.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.640
He talks about in verse number 18 about the importance of praying.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.640
But then he says in verse number 19, after he says pray for all saints, but he says and for me.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:21.640
So Paul is giving the believers of Ephesus a personal prayer request in Ephesians 6.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640
And here's what the request is.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.640
That utterance may be given unto me.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.640
That I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:43.640
For which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.640
I know I've asked the question before but it begs to be asked again in this portion of scripture.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.640
Paul requesting for boldness.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:01.640
Is not Paul one of the most bold witnesses that you see as you read the New Testament?

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:09.640
I mean he stands in boldness before those in authority and he preaches the gospel.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.640
But he asked people to pray for boldness.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.640
That he would open his mouth and speak what he was supposed to speak.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.640
The gospel.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:29.640
That may be some insight as to how Paul was so bold.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.640
He had people praying for him to be bold.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.640
That was his request.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.640
In Colossians chapter number 4 he says this in verse number 2 of Colossians 4.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.640
He's speaking to these believers of Colossians.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.640
He's already said how he's praying for them.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640
Now he's saying pray for me.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640
Continue in prayer.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.640
Verse number 2 of Colossians 4.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.640
And watch in the same with thanksgiving with all.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.640
Praying also for us.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640
What's the prayer request?

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.640
That God would open us a door of utterance.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640
Can I say it in this phrase?

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.640
That God would give us an opportunity.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.640
And then he says this.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.640
To speak the mystery of Christ.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.640
For which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640
Notice what he says.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.640
As I ought to speak.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:26.640
So Paul, understanding the will of God, has his behavior impacted.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640
How do we say that?

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.640
Well, Paul gets saved.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.640
He understands that it was God's will for him to be saved.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.640
He acts nine.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.640
But then Paul is engaged in discipleship and helping people to grow.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.640
Paul then is sharing the gospel.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640
Why?

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.640
Because that's God's will.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:53.640
But his prayer life was influenced by these three thoughts that are given to us of God's will for humanity in 1st Timothy 2.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.640
He prays for people, lost people, to be saved.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.640
He prays for God's people, those that are saved, to be strengthened and to grow spiritually.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.640
He prays that God would give him boldness.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:10.640
And he asks others to pray that he would share the gospel as he ought.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.640
So I simply ask this morning.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:20.640
How has knowing God's will for humanity, God's revealed will, how has it impacted our behavior?

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.640
And how is it influencing our prayer life?

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:32.640
Because in the midst of an exhortation on prayer, God seemingly gives us this parenthetical statement and says,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.640
let me reveal to you my will for humanity.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.640
Number one, it's for lost people to be saved.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.640
Number two, it's for saved people to grow spiritually.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.640
And number three, it's for saved people to share the gospel.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.640
I hope this morning that God's will impacts us.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.640
Impacts our behavior and influences our prayer lives.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640
Shall we pray?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640
Father, we love you.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640
Thank you for your word.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:09.640
I thank you this morning that we do not have to reach our own conclusions with regard to your will for humanity.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:15.640
That we can go to the written, preserved, inspired, preserved word of God.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.640
You have communicated to us what your will is for humanity.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:28.640
God, I pray this morning that we would be impacted and influenced by these truths.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.640
If there's one that's not saved, I pray this morning they'd understand that it's your will for them to be saved today.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.640
Today is the day of salvation.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.640
Maybe for some that are saved, they're just kind of floundering around.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.640
They're not really growing spiritually.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.640
God, would you help them to recognize this morning that your will is for them to grow spiritually?

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.640
It's not enough to just be saved.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.640
I mean, yes, they're going to heaven.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.640
But God, you want them to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.640
God, would you help us to recognize this morning that your will is for us to share the gospel?

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:09.640
Would you help us to evaluate our lives and honestly, sincerely desire to be used of them?

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.880
me, to share the wonderful message of the gospel with those that we come in contact

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.880
with.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.200
I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.040
We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.040
name we pray.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.040
Would you stand with me?

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.800
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.560
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does the altar is open.
