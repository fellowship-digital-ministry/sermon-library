1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
the world in which we live and all the things that we face

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,599
and how we as the people of God must continue to go forward.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,359
Of course, you'll remember as we've studied

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,359
for so many weeks now through these two chapter

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,680
or these two books and through all of the months

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,360
of this calendar year here on Sunday mornings

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,680
that Timothy was ministering in Ephesus.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,680
And as he's ministering in Ephesus,

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,120
he's dealing with false teachers,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,440
he's dealing with pressures

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,440
and all the things that are taking place.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,799
And Paul, if we could sum it up in one simple word

13
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,079
that we've used for our theme,

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,200
Paul's encouragement to Timothy is continue.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,840
Just keep on keeping on,

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,840
keep on doing what God has called you to do.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,560
And I'm so thankful that we too have been given a charge

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,279
to continue to serve the Lord.

19
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,840
We found as we studied last week

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,400
that 2 Timothy chapter number three

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,159
begins with these words, this know also.

22
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,560
And we said that God wants his people to be informed.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,759
He wants us to understand certain things

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,759
with regard to the day in which we're living.

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,580
Here in this passage of scriptures we studied last week,

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,300
there were 20 particular characteristics that God gives us

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,160
with regard to the last days,

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,120
the perilous times that we will be living in.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,839
And we find that as God reveals to Timothy

30
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:17,000
and to the church and to us as God's word

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,059
has been preserved, that he wants us to be informed of this.

32
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,160
He wants us to have knowledge

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,519
with regard to what will be the characteristics

34
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,040
of the days in which we live.

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,040
We said this last week that we see all of these things

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,959
and we really see them increasing rapidly

37
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,919
in the day and age in which we're living.

38
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,319
And so we're reminded that we're living in the last days,

39
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,319
but we're also equally reminded that our God's on the throne

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,959
and that he knew all about it.

41
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,879
And he let us know, he informed us

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,599
and he wants us to be aware.

43
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,360
It's interesting as you begin reading

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,080
in our text of scripture this morning

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,440
in verses 10 through 12, that the Bible starts this way,

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,800
but thou hast fully known.

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,879
And it's interesting because we find that Paul begins saying

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,959
to Timothy in verse number one, this know also.

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,580
He wants them to be aware of the characteristics

50
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,520
of the last days, but then as he transitions

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
into verse number 10, he says, but thou hast fully known.

52
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,679
Timothy was being informed about the apostasy

53
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,279
of the last days in the beginning of this chapter.

54
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,039
And then he's being reminded about the life and ministry

55
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,080
of the apostle Paul, who was his mentor.

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,839
By the way, the apostle Paul, the mentor of Timothy,

57
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,880
remember Paul often refers to Timothy

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,479
as being his son in the faith.

59
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,800
And we find that as his mentor, as Paul fulfilling that role

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,639
and seeking to influence and to instruct Timothy

61
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,919
and to encourage him to continue to serve the Lord,

62
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,080
that Paul says, you have fully known.

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
You have known, and he goes through my doctrine,

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,160
manner of life, purpose, faith, long suffering,

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,279
charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions.

66
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,559
And we'll continue reading in just a moment,

67
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,699
but I want you to know that in a very bullet point

68
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,460
kind of a list that Paul says, you've known these things.

69
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,960
You have fully known.

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,160
We're once again reminded about the close relationship

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,880
that Paul and Timothy had and how Timothy was aware

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,160
of these things.

73
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,559
And we find that it serves as a great example

74
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:22,720
to Timothy with regard to what he also would deal with.

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,679
The subject of persecution is clear here

76
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,020
in our text of scripture.

77
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,839
It's in clear view based upon the truth that we see

78
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,440
in verse number 12, of course,

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,119
coupled with the references in verse number 11.

80
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,339
We'll be looking simply at verses 10 through 12 this morning

81
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,199
as we deal with this thought, the title of the message,

82
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,160
preparation for persecution.

83
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,059
Preparation for persecution.

84
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,820
The Bible says in verse number 10,

85
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,979
but thou hast fully known my doctrine,

86
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,779
manner of life, purpose, faith, long suffering,

87
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:58,100
charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions,

88
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,100
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

89
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,940
What persecutions I endured, but out of them all,

90
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
the Lord delivered me.

91
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,059
Verse 12, yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus

92
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:15,240
shall suffer persecution.

93
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,880
As we look at this thought this morning

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
and deal with the subject of preparation for persecution,

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,700
let me first make a few comments

96
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,500
with regard to the idea of preparation.

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,859
As we think about preparation,

98
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:29,320
we understand that using that term to prepare for something

99
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,619
has a broad application.

100
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:34,220
You can prepare for a lot of different things.

101
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,899
And we find that preparation, no doubt, is necessary.

102
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,579
In fact, I could say it this way,

103
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,220
I prepared for the message this morning.

104
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,000
I prepared for the message that I'll preach this evening.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
Those that taught Sunday school this morning,

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,859
they had a measure of preparation.

107
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,579
If you're gonna cook a meal, you have some preparation.

108
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,899
You do some things ahead of time, you prepare.

109
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,660
And we understand that it has a broad application

110
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,399
with regard to the subject of preparation.

111
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,660
This morning, contextually from 2 Timothy chapter three,

112
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,739
and what we're looking at is preparation for persecution.

113
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,140
Now, as I think about preparation,

114
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,899
and I understand that there's a broad category of things,

115
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,140
application in which we could prepare for,

116
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,239
I find this to be true also,

117
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,339
that there are times in which we prepare for something

118
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,820
that we actually hope never comes to pass.

119
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,779
So when I speak about preparation for persecution,

120
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,119
I'm saying prepare for something

121
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,019
that quite honestly tonight,

122
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,980
today, I'll say from this platform,

123
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,480
and I believe that you probably would agree with me,

124
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,540
I hope that I never have to face persecution.

125
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,779
But the reality is that preparation for persecution

126
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,980
is absolutely necessary.

127
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,940
And we find that though we would give this morning

128
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,059
the instruction that we ought to prepare

129
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,420
for the persecution,

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,119
that we actually would hope that it never happens.

131
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,559
What do I mean by that?

132
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,700
Well, I lived, as you know, I was born in North Carolina,

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,500
I lived a number of years in North Carolina,

134
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,299
and I remember as a young child,

135
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,059
that there are many times in which you had,

136
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,820
during hurricane season,

137
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,980
you had the threat of a storm

138
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,619
hitting the coast where we lived.

139
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:14,179
We weren't that far inland where we lived,

140
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,299
and there were several times

141
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,820
in which we had some pretty serious storms

142
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,100
that were coming, and the way that they were tracking it

143
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,820
looked like we were gonna get hit.

144
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,260
And guess what we did?

145
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,820
We made preparation.

146
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,880
But in so doing, we made the preparation,

147
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,299
but we also kind of hoped

148
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:31,260
that the storm wouldn't actually hit us,

149
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,779
that we wouldn't deal with all of the damages

150
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,220
from the storm, but we made the preparation.

151
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,059
Why?

152
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,700
In the event that the storm did follow the track

153
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,940
that the meteorologist assumed that it would.

154
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,459
Now, here's the reality.

155
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,459
When we made the preparation and the storm didn't come,

156
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,299
we weren't disappointed about the fact that we prepared.

157
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,880
You know when you're disappointed if you didn't prepare?

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,119
When the storm comes.

159
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,339
The storm comes, and you say, you know what?

160
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,100
Those guys don't know what they're talking about.

161
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,339
They've said this before,

162
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,339
and they've always followed this track,

163
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,859
but it never happens, and we've been spared,

164
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,420
and I'm not gonna waste my time preparing,

165
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,660
and then the storm comes, and guess what?

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,260
You regret that you did not prepare.

167
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,260
In a very real sense,

168
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,820
when we talk about the subject this morning

169
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,779
of preparation for persecution,

170
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,899
we find that we live and we have lived

171
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,859
in our lifetime here in the United States of America,

172
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,859
we've had great freedom and we've had great privilege.

173
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,079
We had 18 that were out on visitation yesterday.

174
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,500
We were knocking doors in our community,

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,260
and we were going out and distributing literature

176
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,179
perfectly free to do that.

177
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,299
We had no persecution whatsoever.

178
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:44,799
There was no one, we have the freedom to do it.

179
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,739
Can I tell you this morning that that's not the case

180
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,559
everywhere around the globe?

181
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,100
There are places this morning around the globe

182
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,619
that they do not have the freedoms that we have,

183
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:56,100
and they have not had the freedoms that we have,

184
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,739
and by the way, many places around the globe

185
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,640
that once had the freedoms that we enjoy today

186
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,880
no longer have those freedoms.

187
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,920
You can read in the news about various countries,

188
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,779
you can look at England and Scotland,

189
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,940
and you can look at Canada,

190
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,779
and you can read things that have happened

191
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,220
even in recent weeks where their freedoms

192
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,279
are being squeezed and they're not having

193
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,579
the level of religious liberty that they once did.

194
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:28,320
As we think about this idea of preparation for persecution,

195
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,880
I hope this morning that if persecution would come to us

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,119
in the sense in which we're gonna deal with this morning,

197
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,679
that we would be prepared for it

198
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,799
and that we'd be ready to stand.

199
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
In the face of the opposition, in the face of adversity,

200
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,919
that in the evil day, as Ephesians 6 says, we would stand.

201
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,539
We find that as Paul is writing to Timothy

202
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,799
and Timothy is ministering in Ephesus,

203
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,919
it's interesting that Ephesians 6 deals with

204
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,760
all of this instruction with regard

205
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,239
to be strong in the Lord, put on the whole armor of God,

206
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,440
and Paul is writing to Timothy about the persecution

207
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,039
and preparing for such persecution.

208
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,000
I believe this morning that if we fail to prepare

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,080
for persecution and persecution comes in your life

210
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,619
and in my life, that two things will be true.

211
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:18,520
Number one, we will regret not preparing,

212
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,559
and number two, we will be vulnerable

213
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,000
to the attack of the enemy.

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,679
And so this morning, we understand

215
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,320
that persecution is nothing new.

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,080
In fact, if you study in the book of Acts

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
in the fourth chapter, the persecution begins.

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,520
The church, of course, is born and God is working.

219
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,599
Jesus Christ said, I will build my church

220
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,960
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,

221
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,159
but we know that Satan hates the church,

222
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,320
Satan hates every child of God,

223
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,119
and he's bringing persecution, he's bringing attack,

224
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,700
and what they started to do in Acts chapter number four

225
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,059
is they tried to threaten the people of God

226
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,320
to no longer speak the name of God

227
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,140
nor to preach the word of God,

228
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,940
and we find that as they faced.

229
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,060
various levels of persecution,

230
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,100
whether that was being incarcerated,

231
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,860
whether that was being interrogated,

232
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,100
whether that was being beaten or threatened,

233
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,780
we find that they faced great levels of persecution.

234
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,180
You come to chapter number seven

235
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,860
and you find the first martyr of the New Testament church,

236
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,740
with Stephen giving his life, and as he preached,

237
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,540
and what a message he preached in Acts chapter number seven,

238
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,700
he knew the Bible, he knew the scriptures,

239
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,720
and he preached a powerful message,

240
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,160
and there was great difficulty with regard

241
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,520
to what he faced as those people

242
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
that stood there and heard that message.

243
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,080
They were cut to the heart.

244
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,920
They were dealing with the truth

245
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
that had been given to them,

246
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,920
and we find that as they responded with stoning him,

247
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,600
and he looks up and he sees

248
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,020
as Jesus would welcome him to heaven,

249
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,320
but then in chapter eight,

250
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,200
the persecution rises a whole nother level.

251
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
It increases, it intensifies,

252
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,120
and the believers, they're scattered abroad,

253
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
but here's what happened.

254
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,160
As the enemy is fighting and the enemy is persecuting,

255
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
the people of God are scattered.

256
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,720
The apostles stay there in Jerusalem

257
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,080
according to the text of scripture,

258
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,160
but we find that the people depart,

259
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,000
and you know what they do?

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
They went everywhere preaching the word,

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,660
and so through persecution,

262
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,180
you know what really happened is the church grew.

263
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,120
The church multiplied.

264
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
More people heard the gospel,

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,840
and we find that starting in Acts four,

266
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
and I gave you a very quick overview

267
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,520
of those few chapters in the book of Acts,

268
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,959
but you find that throughout the entire church age,

269
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,860
persecution is nothing new to the people of God.

270
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,000
Persecution is no new tactic.

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,420
We find that the enemy of God's people,

272
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,880
of God's church has sought to persecute,

273
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,779
to cause the people of God to stop, to cease,

274
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,240
but yet God's people are to rise up and continue.

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Notice with me in our text of scripture

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,520
in 2 Timothy chapter three this morning.

277
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,900
I want you to notice number one, the experience.

278
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,160
The experience.

279
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,880
We find that the apostle Paul,

280
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,959
he says to his son of the faith, Timothy,

281
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,000
he says, but thou hast fully known in verse number 10

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,160
my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,

283
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,680
faith, longsuffering, charity, patience.

284
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,900
I mean, that list, we could take each of those,

285
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,800
and we could develop a message just from verse number 10,

286
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,440
and dive in and see that the apostle Paul,

287
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,839
he says, you've fully known my doctrine,

288
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,479
the things that I believe, the things that I've taught,

289
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,500
the things that I've preached.

290
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,240
Remember in just a few verses that the apostle Paul

291
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,320
will say all scripture is given by inspiration of God

292
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,740
and is profitable, number one, for doctrine.

293
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,119
Doctrine is important.

294
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:43,180
Remember that Timothy was left in Ephesus,

295
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,559
and he talks to them about the fact

296
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,720
that there were those that were bringing in false teachings

297
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
and that he must stand and must give forth sound words,

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,880
sound doctrine, and we find that the apostle Paul,

299
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,600
he says, you've known my doctrine.

300
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
Not only have you known my doctrine,

301
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,279
but you've known my manner of life.

302
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,400
Now think about that, Paul's behavior.

303
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
It's interesting as you study the book of Acts

304
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,279
and you trace the steps of Paul,

305
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,800
you know what you find is that Paul had really a habit,

306
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,520
if I could use that word this morning, in a positive sense.

307
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Everywhere he went, the Bible uses this word,

308
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,680
as his manner was.

309
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,119
He'd go in, and what'd he do?

310
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,160
He'd go to the synagogue and he'd begin to preach.

311
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,520
Why'd he go to the synagogue?

312
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,600
Well, because that's where the people were gathered.

313
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,400
And so he went to where the people were gathered

314
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,080
so that he could preach the word of God,

315
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,520
so that he could reason with them out of the scriptures

316
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,360
and show them that this Jesus is Christ.

317
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,139
And he goes, and this was his manner, and guess what?

318
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,400
When he would go, he would constantly face

319
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,400
the same level of resistance, of persecution, of opposition,

320
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,479
but yet he'd leave one city and he'd go to another city

321
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,919
and he'd do the same exact thing.

322
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,919
He'd go in and he'd preach the gospel,

323
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,440
and we find that Paul says, you've known my doctrine,

324
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
but you've also known my manner of life.

325
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,080
And by the way, if the message of your lips

326
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,760
does not align with the message of your life,

327
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,600
you have a real hard time influencing people.

328
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,839
But when the message of your lips

329
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,880
and the message of your life are consistent,

330
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,320
as Paul says, you've known my doctrine,

331
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,200
but you've also known my manner of life,

332
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
you've fully known, then there's influence,

333
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,519
there's impact, you see that it's a testimony

334
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,480
where I'm living out my belief.

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,559
I've said it this way over the years,

336
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,140
my belief must impact, it will impact my behavior.

337
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:39,760
What you believe to be true will impact your behavior,

338
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,059
and how you behave will reveal what you believe.

339
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,360
It's a coin that's, you can look at both sides,

340
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,559
you can see my belief will impact my behavior,

341
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,679
but then my behavior reveals what I believe.

342
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,360
You know why I don't jump off the roof?

343
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,119
Because I believe in gravity, amen?

344
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,880
I believe that if I jump off that roof,

345
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm going down at, what is it, 9.8 meters per second,

346
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,440
or whatever it is, I'm going down quick.

347
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,679
I believe that, so I don't jump off the roof.

348
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,239
And we find here this morning that when what we believe

349
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,000
to be true about God will impact our behavior,

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,799
he says, you've fully known my doctrine,

351
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,959
my manner of life, my purpose.

352
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,160
Oh, Paul had a purpose.

353
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
You know what his purpose was?

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,760
To glorify God.

355
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,880
His purpose was to please God in all that he,

356
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,140
for me to live is Christ.

357
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,160
Is that not what Paul said in Philippians chapter number one?

358
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,239
We find that he said, you've known my faith.

359
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,279
Paul was a man of faith, he believed God.

360
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,959
He stood up and proclaimed in Acts chapter 27,

361
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,500
I believe God.

362
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,799
By the way, that's not the only time

363
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,040
that Paul demonstrated faith.

364
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,100
He was a man that believed that God was going to do

365
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,519
what God said he would do.

366
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,320
Every time he preached the gospel,

367
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
you know what he was doing?

368
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,839
He was exercising faith because he proclaimed,

369
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,480
for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

370
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,200
for it is the power of God unto salvation

371
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
to everyone that believe it,

372
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,880
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

373
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,160
And since he believed that, his exercising in preaching,

374
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,519
he was exercising faith in what he believed

375
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
was true that God said.

376
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
He was living by faith.

377
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
In fact, in that same passage of scripture

378
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,920
in Romans chapter number one, he says this,

379
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,360
for the just shall live by faith.

380
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
He's referencing back to the Old Testament

381
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,880
as he makes that declaration.

382
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,000
Notice he says long-suffering.

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,279
Oh, Paul was a man that was long-suffering.

384
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,360
He was patient.

385
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,600
He talks about his charity, his love.

386
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,959
He talks about patience again.

387
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,080
You know what's interesting?

388
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,559
As you look at some of these statements

389
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,600
that are made in verse number 10,

390
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,320
you see the alignment with the fruit of the spirit

391
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,260
in Galatians chapter number five.

392
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,080
And I'm thankful that Paul, he says,

393
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
you've known these things.

394
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,279
But then we get into verse number 11

395
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,080
and he mentions two additional things.

396
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,040
He says persecutions, afflictions.

397
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,600
The persecutions and afflictions.

398
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,519
We find that Paul faced these difficulties.

399
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,000
I mentioned a moment ago that the goal of persecution

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,320
is to cause the individual that is being persecuted

401
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,959
to cease or to flee.

402
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,480
And we find this morning that as Paul says,

403
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,839
you've known my persecutions,

404
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,080
you've known my afflictions, that contextually,

405
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,519
he says in verse 11, which came unto me at Antioch,

406
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,720
at Iconium, at Lystra.

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,940
As we begin to think about these three cities

408
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,040
that the apostle Paul mentions by name in verse number 11,

409
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
we find that this is a reference back

410
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,559
to the first missionary journey.

411
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,279
If you were to go back in your Bibles to Acts 13 and 14,

412
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,360
you find that as Paul left the church at Antioch,

413
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,440
as they were sent out, they were called of the Holy Spirit

414
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,440
to go and to enter into this ministry of taking the gospel.

415
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,480
And we find that really in Acts 13 and 14,

416
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,600
as we look at the first missionary journey,

417
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,440
if you read the book of Galatians,

418
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,080
he says unto the churches, plural, of Galatia.

419
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,399
And what he's referencing is Galatia being a region,

420
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,679
it's not the church of Galatia,

421
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,799
it's the churches in Galatia

422
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,839
because these churches were established

423
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,600
during this first missionary journey in Acts 13 and 14.

424
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
But you know what happens?

425
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,000
As he leaves Antioch, they first, as they come,

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,519
they enter into the first city.

427
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,459
And as they come to the first city, they face opposition.

428
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,920
I mean, there's opportunity that they have

429
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
to be able to stand up in verse number 16.

430
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,480
Then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hands,

431
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,239
said, men of Israel and you that fear God,

432
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,159
give audience in Acts 13 in verse number 16.

433
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,679
He begins to preach the word of God,

434
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,479
but we find that they had come to Antioch and Pisidian.

435
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,960
That's the first city where they are

436
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,880
after they went through Perga

437
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,440
as you look at the beginning of chapter number 13.

438
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,640
And he has opportunity,

439
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,039
but it's not long after the opportunity

440
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,760
that he has this opposition.

441
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,820
And we find that as they had opposition,

442
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,460
they were run really out of town.

443
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,080
In verse number 50, we're just kind of skipping through here

444
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,760
and you come to verse number 50 of Acts 13

445
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,720
and you find that the Bible says that the Jews

446
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,320
stirred up the devout and honorable women

447
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,940
and the chief men of the city

448
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,739
and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas

449
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:13,820
and expelled them out of their coast.

450
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,119
And so we find that the persecution was there

451
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,419
in chapter 14, they come to Iconium

452
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,840
and we find that is there in Iconium again,

453
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,659
there's an opportunity to be able to preach

454
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,720
the word of God.

455
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,859
In verse seven, it says there they preached the gospel.

456
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:29,419
What a blessing to be able to see what's taking place,

457
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,220
but you come to verse 19 and you find that the Bible says

458
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,020
there came certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium

459
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,820
who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul,

460
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,580
drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.

461
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,780
The Bible says that he, Paul,

462
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,119
they believe that he was dead after he faced this

463
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,539
and we're just kind of hitting a couple of highlights here

464
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,479
in Acts 13 and 14 during this first missionary journey

465
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,900
so that you can see, yes, there's opportunity,

466
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,460
but there's opposition, there's persecution,

467
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,299
there's a flip.

468
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,299
What is it that he's facing the persecution for?

469
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,899
What is it that he's facing affliction for?

470
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:09,179
For obeying God, for preaching the gospel,

471
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,339
for simply obeying the Lord.

472
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,079
God had given him a commission.

473
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,219
God had given him a call,

474
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,379
and we find that Paul is carrying forth

475
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:21,559
that call that God had placed upon his life.

476
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,759
It's interesting for we find

477
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,499
that as Paul would face that persecution

478
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,159
and he would deal with that cycle, if you will,

479
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,059
of an opportunity given followed by opposition,

480
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,959
that the Bible tells us in verse 20 of Acts 14,

481
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,359
after he'd been stoned in verse 19,

482
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,099
it says, how be it as the disciples stood round about him,

483
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,139
he rose up and came into the city,

484
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:46,099
and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

485
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,479
And it's very interesting because he goes now to Derbe

486
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,379
and notice in verse 21 that the Bible says,

487
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,379
and when they had preached the gospel

488
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,579
to that city and had taught many,

489
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:58,959
they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch.

490
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,719
And he went back to the very cities

491
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,419
in which he had faced the persecution.

492
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,259
He had boldness and he had courage

493
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,459
and he was walking with the Lord and pleasing the Lord.

494
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,059
And we find that Paul says,

495
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,939
listen, I've experienced some difficulty.

496
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,399
I've experienced some persecution and some affliction.

497
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,199
And Timothy, you know that,

498
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:21,679
you fully are aware of what I have experienced.

499
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,619
And Paul is sharing that experience.

500
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,719
We could look this morning at a variety of passages.

501
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,179
Let me just use one more in Acts 23

502
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,019
and let me show you here what's happening in Acts 23.

503
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,999
In fact, this is a portion of scripture

504
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:39,939
that causes me to laugh often as I look at the situation

505
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:42,099
that's unfolding here in Acts 23

506
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,159
and how God worked so miraculously.

507
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,659
But we find the beginning in verse number 11,

508
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,139
the Bible says in the night following,

509
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:52,519
the Lord stood by him and said, be of good cheer, Paul,

510
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,099
for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem,

511
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,399
so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

512
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,079
By the way, that right there

513
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,539
is enough to keep someone going for the Lord.

514
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,679
God spoke to him and said,

515
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,759
you've testified of me at Jerusalem

516
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,279
and you're gonna testify of me at Rome.

517
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,239
And Paul believed that God was going to bring to pass

518
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,159
what God revealed to him.

519
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,119
But it's interesting because the Bible says

520
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,519
in verse number 12, and when it was day,

521
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,059
certain of the Jews banded together

522
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,479
and bound themselves under a curse,

523
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,519
saying that they would neither eat nor drink

524
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,439
till they had killed Paul.

525
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,159
Now what's interesting to me about this

526
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,959
is the fact that God gave Paul a promise in verse number 11

527
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,699
and then in verse number 12,

528
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:42,399
these men make this covenant really with one another

529
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,299
that they're going to kill Paul.

530
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,999
I believe that they died

531
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,879
or they pulled back on their covenant

532
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,879
because they had to either eat or drink or they died

533
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,739
because they never killed Paul, amen?

534
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,059
God kept them safe.

535
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,259
Notice in verse number 13,

536
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,379
the Bible says, and they were more than 40,

537
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,819
which had made this conspiracy.

538
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,939
And they came to the chief priests and elders and said,

539
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,019
we have bound ourselves under a great curse

540
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,979
that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.

541
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:11,059
Now, therefore, ye with the council

542
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,939
signify to the chief captain

543
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,459
that he bring him down unto you tomorrow

544
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,099
as though you would inquire something

545
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,959
more perfectly concerning him.

546
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:22,979
And we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

547
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,259
And so they got their plan.

548
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,179
They say, hey, we want you to bring him out.

549
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,019
And as you bring him,

550
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:27,859
because you're going to act like

551
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:28,939
you got more questions for him,

552
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,339
man, we're going to be waiting for him

553
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,739
and we're going to take his life.

554
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,739
The Bible tells us in verse number 16

555
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:37,739
that Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait.

556
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:40,259
He went and entered into the castle and told Paul.

557
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:43,499
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him and said,

558
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,579
bring this young man under the chief captain

559
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,599
for he has a certain thing to tell him.

560
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,339
So he took him and brought him to the chief captain

561
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:54,219
and said, Paul, the prisoner called me unto him

562
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:56,459
and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee

563
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,779
who has something to say unto thee.

564
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,779
Then the chief captain took him by the hand

565
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,299
and went with him aside privately and asked him,

566
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,299
what is that thou hast to tell me?

567
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,499
And he said, the Jews have agreed to desire thee

568
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:11,019
that thou wouldest bring down Paul tomorrow

569
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:13,539
into the council as though they would inquire

570
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,539
somewhat of him more perfectly.

571
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,720
But do not thou yield unto them

572
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
for there lie in wait for him of them more than 40 men

573
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,839
which have bound themselves with an oath

574
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,440
that they will neither eat nor drink

575
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,299
till they have killed him.

576
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,639
And now are they ready looking for a promise from thee.

577
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,479
So the chief captain then let the young man depart

578
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,679
and charged him, see thou tell no man

579
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,319
that thou has showed these things to me.

580
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,159
And he called unto him two centurions saying,

581
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,199
make ready 200 soldiers to go to Caesarea

582
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:48,959
and horsemen threescore and 10 and spearmen 200

583
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,220
at the third hour of the night.

584
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,059
How many bound themselves under an oath?

585
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:53,899
40.

586
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:58,259
And here they gathered together 200 soldiers,

587
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:00,259
70 horsemen and 200 spearmen.

588
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,559
God was protecting his man.

589
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,139
And the Bible says in verse number 24,

590
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,739
and provided them beast that they may set Paul on,

591
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,119
notice these words and bring him safe

592
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,119
unto Felix the governor.

593
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,559
You know what happened?

594
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,019
Paul was brought safe.

595
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,959
Because as we look in our text of scripture,

596
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:28,679
not only did the experience of Paul include difficulty,

597
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,279
but it included deliverance.

598
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,479
The experience of Paul was one of difficulty,

599
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,599
but also of deliverance.

600
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,319
Notice in verse number 11,

601
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,759
back in our text in 2 Timothy chapter three,

602
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,739
he says, persecutions, afflictions,

603
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,359
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,

604
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,319
what persecutions I endured,

605
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,599
but notice the end of verse number 11,

606
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,159
but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

607
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,199
Listen, you might face some difficulty,

608
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,859
I might face some difficulty,

609
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:01,519
but I'm so thankful for the deliverance of our God.

610
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,079
I'm so thankful that our God is able to deliver us.

611
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,679
We sing about God's ability, he is able to deliver thee.

612
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,479
It's a great hymn that we sing.

613
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,720
And it's a reminder to us that God is able.

614
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
I'm reminded of those three Hebrew children

615
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,839
in the book of Daniel, when they stand before Nebuchadnezzar,

616
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,519
the powerful king of Babylon,

617
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,759
and they say, our God is able.

618
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,720
And if not, be it known, we're not gonna bow,

619
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,879
we're not gonna give in,

620
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,000
we'll go through that fiery furnace.

621
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,399
And they understood, and listen,

622
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:35,239
many a people have understood throughout the history

623
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,399
of the church that God will deliver his people.

624
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,799
It may be that he delivers us through the storm,

625
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,279
it may be that he delivers us from the storm,

626
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,399
but God will deliver.

627
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,819
Many people have died for the cause of Christ.

628
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,479
But can I tell you that God delivered them?

629
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,119
Because here's the deliverance,

630
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,679
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

631
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,639
Amen.

632
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,899
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

633
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,839
Paul said, for to me to live is Christ,

634
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,759
but to die is gain.

635
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,759
What is the gain?

636
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,519
You know that many people in our world today

637
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,359
do not have that perspective that death is gain.

638
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,039
Many people in our world today actually fear dying

639
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,679
because they have no idea,

640
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,519
they have no assurance or confidence

641
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,479
what will happen when they die.

642
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,039
They have the fear of death

643
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,699
that the book of Hebrews speaks of,

644
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,519
but I'm thankful that my God conquered sin,

645
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,479
death, and the grave.

646
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,000
He's alive forevermore,

647
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,599
and he's given to us the deliverance from the fear of death.

648
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,619
And we find that Paul says that I suffered these things,

649
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:40,819
I experienced great difficulty,

650
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,319
but I want you to know, Timothy,

651
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,519
that not only did I experience difficulty,

652
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,079
but I experienced deliverance.

653
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,639
I'm thankful for the full picture

654
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:51,119
that God gives us in this passage of Scripture.

655
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm thankful for the examples

656
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,319
that God has given us in his word

657
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,959
that we can go to and that we can see

658
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,379
how God delivered his people.

659
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,720
It's interesting, in Acts 25,

660
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
if you look at verses one through four,

661
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,399
that you see another, a miraculous situation

662
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,940
where the apostle Paul was dealing with people

663
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,039
that were trying to persuade those in authority

664
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,039
to cause Paul to come in order that he might be killed.

665
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,679
And in Acts chapter 25, it was Festus that came,

666
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,379
and the Bible says that he ascended

667
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:27,039
from Caesarea to Jerusalem in verse number one of Acts 25.

668
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,599
And so if you get in your mind's eye,

669
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,639
what he did is he left Caesarea and he went to Jerusalem.

670
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,559
He took this journey to go there

671
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,399
from his place in Caesarea to go to Jerusalem.

672
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,239
And so the high priest and the chief of the Jews

673
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,839
informed him against Paul and besought him.

674
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,799
Here's what they desired for him to do.

675
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,839
They desired that they would bring Paul to Jerusalem.

676
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,679
Why?

677
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,399
So that they would have opportunity to kill him.

678
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,119
You know what Festus says?

679
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,859
No, I'll go back to Caesarea and I'll hear him there.

680
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,919
You read in verse number four.

681
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,119
And this is amazing to me.

682
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,039
What's so amazing to me is that this man, Festus,

683
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,679
just left Caesarea to go to Jerusalem,

684
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,399
and then it would have been much more convenient

685
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,140
for him to simply have Paul come from Caesarea to Jerusalem

686
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,440
to hear him there.

687
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,279
By the way, those that would bring the charges against Paul

688
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,919
were already in Jerusalem,

689
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,500
and it would have been much more convenient.

690
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,339
But guess what?

691
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,279
My God was at work.

692
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,760
And God moved in the heart of Festus to say,

693
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,880
no, I'm gonna go back up there to Caesarea.

694
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,479
And if you guys wanna bring accusation against him,

695
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,080
if you wanna come for the trial,

696
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,799
you come up to Caesarea,

697
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,200
and that's where we'll have the trial.

698
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,080
Listen, our God is able.

699
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
And can I tell you that he works in ways

700
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,979
that we don't always understand.

701
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,200
But our God's always at work.

702
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,599
He's always at work.

703
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,200
And I'm thankful for that.

704
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,719
We see number one, the experience.

705
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,239
I want you to look at verse number 12

706
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,799
and see number two with me this morning, the expectation.

707
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,239
We find that there's an experience that Paul shares

708
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,080
with his son in the faith.

709
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,880
The fact that there's going to be.

710
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,220
There's going to be difficulty, there's going to be persecution and affliction.

711
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,720
He endured that, he suffered that, but he also experienced the deliverance of God.

712
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,600
And now we see the expectation in verse number 12.

713
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
It says,

714
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,720
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

715
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,680
You say, I don't like that verse.

716
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,240
It's God's Word.

717
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,840
It's God's Word.

718
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,600
And we find here this morning that I am thankful and you should be thankful this morning that

719
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,120
God lets us know what we should expect.

720
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,180
For in so doing, he gives us the opportunity to prepare for what will come.

721
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,000
And that's gracious of our God to do that.

722
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,080
It's gracious of our God to let us know what we should expect.

723
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,400
And we see it revealed to us in verse number 12.

724
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,040
Paul, listen, there's some today that are these prosperity preachers that preach heresy.

725
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,120
That tell you, oh, just give your life to Jesus and everything's going to be perfectly

726
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,920
good and you're going to have wealth and health and so on and so forth.

727
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:13,040
Listen, 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 12, Paul is telling Timothy, listen, serve

728
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,600
God, continue, don't give up in Ephesus, don't give in to the pressures.

729
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,320
I know that there are false teachers.

730
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,960
I know that you're dealing with opposition.

731
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,600
I know all that's happening.

732
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,840
But I want you to continue.

733
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,320
I want you to keep serving God.

734
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,880
I want you to be faithful where God has planted you to do what God has called you to do.

735
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,280
And yes, I've experienced some things, but Timothy, let me inform you that you too should

736
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,720
expect to suffer persecution.

737
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,840
And in so doing, Timothy would then have the opportunity just as we do this morning to

738
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,480
prepare for such a day.

739
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,400
Here in verse number 12, the Bible says, yea, and all that will live godly in Christ

740
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,120
Jesus shall suffer persecution.

741
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,320
Again, the goal of persecution is to cause the individual that's being persecuted to

742
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,840
cease, to flee, to give up, to give in under the pressures.

743
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,360
In John 15 and verse number 18, let me remind you of some words of Jesus in the gospel of

744
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
John.

745
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,520
In John chapter 15, 16, and 17, I'm going to look at a few verses in each of those chapters

746
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,919
this morning to help you be reminded of what Jesus said to his disciples.

747
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,440
In John 15 and verse number 18, the Bible says this, if the world hates you, you know

748
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,080
that it hated me before it hated you.

749
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own.

750
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,800
But because you're not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore

751
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
the world hateth you.

752
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,639
By the way, I'm thankful I'm not in the world.

753
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:51,639
Amen?

754
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm not, listen, this world is not my home.

755
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,279
I've been saved by the grace of God.

756
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,639
If you're saved this morning, then you're not of the world either.

757
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,840
Yes, I understand John 17, we're still in the world, but we're not of the world.

758
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,680
My citizenship is in heaven.

759
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,600
And so he says, if you were of the world, the world would love his own.

760
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,520
But because we're not of the world, he says, listen, if the world hates you, don't be surprised

761
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
at that.

762
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,540
Don't be surprised when you face the opposition, the persecution, why?

763
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,279
Because it hated me, Jesus says, before it's ever going to hate you.

764
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,000
John 16, verse number one, the Bible says, these things have I spoken unto you that ye

765
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
should not be offended.

766
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,040
Then they shall put you out of the synagogues, yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth

767
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,960
you will think that he doeth God's service.

768
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,360
And these things will they do unto you, why?

769
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,940
Because they have not known the Father nor me.

770
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,480
But these things I have told you that when the time shall come, you may remember that

771
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I told you of them.

772
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,639
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

773
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:56,580
But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, whither goest thou?

774
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,960
He tells him in verse number seven, nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for

775
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
you that I go away.

776
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,720
For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you.

777
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,919
But if I depart, I will send him unto you.

778
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,440
Jesus is letting the disciples know, he said, these things have I spoken unto you.

779
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,639
Listen, there's coming a day you're going to have opposition and affliction and persecution.

780
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,320
And I want you to understand these things.

781
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,880
I want you to remember that I'm telling you these things.

782
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,320
And by the way, verse seven, it's expedient that I go away.

783
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,200
It is absolutely necessary, why?

784
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,040
Because if I go away, he goes to the cross, he's buried, he rises, he ascends to heaven,

785
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,279
then he's gonna send the comforter, the Holy Spirit.

786
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:38,480
By the way, I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God indwells me today.

787
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,720
And what a gift that God has given to us.

788
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,200
And he says to us this morning that it's expedient that I go away.

789
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,839
In verse number 33 of John 16, he says, these things have I spoken unto you that you might

790
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,760
have peace.

791
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,360
In the world, you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.

792
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,920
I have overcome the world.

793
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,600
We serve the risen Christ.

794
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,160
We serve the one who is the King of kings and Lord of lords, the one that conquered

795
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,820
sin, death, and the grave.

796
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,800
He is alive forevermore.

797
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,119
And he's told us that we're to be of good cheer, that we're to have that peace that

798
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,600
he offers.

799
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:20,119
In John 17, in verse number 14, notice the Bible says this, I have given them thy word,

800
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,600
and the world hath hated them.

801
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Why?

802
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,959
Because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

803
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:31,360
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep

804
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,119
them from the evil.

805
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,160
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

806
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,320
Sanctify them through thy truth.

807
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,279
Thy word is truth.

808
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:45,559
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

809
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,239
And for their sakes, I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the

810
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,239
truth.

811
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,239
Notice this in verse number 20.

812
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,160
It's a precious verse of Scripture.

813
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,179
The Bible says, neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me

814
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:00,720
through their word.

815
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
You know, this is perpetuity.

816
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,520
This is every Christian, every person that's ever been born again, the Bible is speaking

817
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,580
of in verse 20, where Jesus says, I'm praying for them, but not for them alone.

818
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,059
He says, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.

819
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:20,040
As the gospel has been proclaimed throughout the centuries, people have been saved by the

820
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,980
grace of God, and Jesus sees that in this prayer, and he mentions that in verse 20.

821
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,320
Verse 21, that they all may be one as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they

822
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,559
also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

823
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,679
And so we find that there's Jesus, as he's teaching the disciples, as he's preparing

824
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,940
them for his soon going to the cross of Calvary, he's telling them, listen, you can expect

825
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,600
that you're going to have tribulation, you're going to have persecution, you're going to

826
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,160
have affliction, but be of good cheer, for I've overcome the world.

827
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,760
Notice in Acts 14, in verse number 22, notice what the Bible says.

828
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,880
We referenced this portion of Scripture earlier, and we find that as we look here in Acts 14

829
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,959
and verse 22 specifically, as Paul left and he goes to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,

830
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:17,440
back to those cities during the first missionary journey, notice in verse 22 what he says.

831
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,800
It says this, confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in

832
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,880
the faith.

833
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,179
And then our theme, continue.

834
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,220
Notice he's exhorting them to continue in the faith, but then notice, and that we must

835
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,619
through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

836
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,580
In this world you shall have tribulation.

837
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,380
You're going to deal with persecution, you're going to deal with affliction, yea?

838
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,760
And all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

839
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,739
So he's given us, he's revealed to us what we should expect as we live for Christ.

840
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,459
In 1 Peter chapter 4, Peter is writing to a group of people that are suffering great

841
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:58,679
persecution in 1 Peter throughout the book.

842
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,459
We find that these people are in need of comfort, we find that God in the very first chapter

843
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:11,459
of the book of 1 Peter, he's encouraging them through this truth with regard to the trying

844
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:15,300
fire of the Lord and what it produces.

845
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,339
The refining process, the refining fire, if we can use that terminology this morning.

846
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:25,480
And he says this to these believers in 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse number 6.

847
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,559
He says wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you're in heaviness

848
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,179
through manifold temptations.

849
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,020
And every time, and I know I mention it every time I read this verse of scripture, he says

850
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,479
though now for a season, what I'm thankful for is a season is not forever.

851
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:46,940
I don't know how long the season is, you don't know how long the season is, but I know that

852
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,220
the season will end.

853
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,340
It's not forever.

854
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:55,299
He says at the end of 2 Peter in chapter number 3 that you suffer for a while, again

855
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,739
a while is not forever, amen.

856
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:01,700
And you say, but it's been a long while, I understand and God knows and he knows all

857
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,859
about it and his timing is perfect and he's able, but I want you to understand this morning,

858
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,840
it's not forever.

859
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,919
He says if need be in verse number 6, listen, God knows what we need and he knows what to

860
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:18,619
bring in our lives to refine us, to cause us to be conformed to the image of his dear

861
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:19,619
son.

862
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,260
And I'm remembering in my personal devotions from Romans chapter number 8, I was reading

863
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,580
several chapters there, but in chapter number 8, in verse number 29 that God, he predestinated

864
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,179
us to be conformed to the image of his dear son.

865
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,859
I'm to be like Christ.

866
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:36,220
Christ suffered.

867
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,859
He faced great difficulty.

868
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,140
We find that there are times in which God knows, listen, he knows what we need more

869
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
than we know what we need.

870
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,539
You say, I don't need this right now.

871
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,140
God knows and God's in control and God has a purpose.

872
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,299
You say, but the storm is too much for me.

873
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,580
God's in control, rest.

874
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,220
Let God have his way, learn the lesson.

875
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,940
Notice verse 7 of 1 Peter 1, that the trial of your faith.

876
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,740
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,

877
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,200
though it be tried with fire,

878
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,940
might be found unto praise and honor and glory

879
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,320
at the appearing of Jesus Christ,

880
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,120
whom having not seen ye love,

881
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,880
in whom though now ye see him not yet believing,

882
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,880
ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."

883
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,840
Just think about the rejoicing that's mentioned here

884
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,220
in a season of great trial and difficulty.

885
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,260
In chapter number four, in verse number 12,

886
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,680
we find that Peter says to these believers,

887
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,780
again, as we understand the expectation,

888
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,900
he says, beloved, in verse number 12,

889
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,320
think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,

890
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,660
which is to try you,

891
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,360
as though some strange thing happened unto you.

892
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,180
No, think it not strange.

893
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,940
Why does he say think it not strange?

894
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,420
Well, because Jesus already told us

895
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,100
that this is what we're gonna face.

896
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,300
He already revealed to us,

897
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,780
he's already let us know that this is what we should expect.

898
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,020
We should expect these things in the world.

899
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,860
Why?

900
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,680
If the world hates you,

901
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,180
remember that it hated him first,

902
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,460
and we're not of the world.

903
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,819
And so we find that he says, think it not strange.

904
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:10,139
Yes, I know that you're in a fiery trial.

905
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,600
I know that you're dealing with this,

906
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,180
but it's not a strange thing,

907
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,100
because we find that we understand

908
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,220
that this is what we should expect.

909
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,740
He says in verse 13, but rejoice,

910
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,180
inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's suffering,

911
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,500
that when his glory shall be revealed,

912
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,700
you may be glad also with exceeding joy.

913
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,020
He tells us in verse 14,

914
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,020
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.

915
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,700
The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.

916
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,340
On their part is evil spoken of,

917
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,980
but on your part, he is glorified.

918
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm always convicted when I read of those

919
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,880
that gave their life for Christ,

920
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,779
literally those that were burned at the stake.

921
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,100
As they're literally being burned to death,

922
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,380
how they're singing and rejoicing and testifying.

923
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,959
It convicts me when I read those accounts.

924
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,139
Because truly, as we look in 1 Peter 4,

925
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,819
happy are ye.

926
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,220
They're rejoicing.

927
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
So the question really comes down to this

928
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,139
as we wrap up the message this morning.

929
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:18,300
We see the experience, we see the expectation,

930
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,660
but I want you to notice very quickly here

931
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,059
in the middle of the verse of scripture,

932
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,779
in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 11,

933
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,779
I want you to see specifically what Paul says

934
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,139
right in the midst of the verse.

935
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:33,779
And we're gonna look at this and close this morning.

936
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,500
He says, persecutions, afflictions,

937
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,320
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

938
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,720
But then notice this phrase, what persecutions I endured.

939
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:45,940
But out of them all, the Lord delivered me.

940
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,040
We talked about the experience.

941
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,419
We talked about the expectation.

942
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:51,680
Now I want you to consider the enduring.

943
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
How do I endure?

944
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,380
How did Paul, how was he able to say

945
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,020
what persecutions I endured?

946
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
What was it about the Apostle Paul?

947
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,979
What was it about his life that enabled him

948
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,380
to endure those things that he experienced,

949
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,580
that allowed him to go from city to city,

950
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,699
from place to place and preach the gospel

951
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:12,820
and face the persecution and the opposition

952
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,740
and the tribulation that he faced, but yet to continue?

953
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
What was it that allowed him to endure?

954
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,580
What is it that will enable you?

955
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,559
What is it that will enable me this morning

956
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,460
to endure when persecution comes?

957
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,460
Because truly, that's the idea

958
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,180
of preparation for persecution.

959
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,220
See, do I wanna cave in when the persecution comes,

960
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,460
when the opposition comes?

961
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,020
Do I wanna cave in and crumble and give up

962
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,699
and throw in the towel, or do I wanna continue,

963
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,139
and how can I continue?

964
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:43,580
Is it an idea that I just pull myself up

965
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,320
by my own bootstraps, that I just kinda man up?

966
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,820
No, because the outward man will perish,

967
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,260
but it's the inward man that's renewed day by day.

968
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,460
And we need to have not physical strength,

969
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,779
because we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

970
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:59,320
but we need to have spiritual strength.

971
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,919
We need to be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

972
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,740
We need to put on the whole armor of God

973
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,940
that we might be able to stand in that evil day.

974
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,380
You know, it's amazing the disciples,

975
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,740
they were able to endure.

976
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,380
We've mentioned much about the Apostle Paul this morning

977
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,220
as he's the one writing to Timothy, his son in the faith,

978
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,779
but in Acts chapter number five,

979
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:21,540
after the disciples faced some serious persecution,

980
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,339
it started in chapter four, it continues in chapter five,

981
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:27,420
and they wanna kill him, they wanna put him to death,

982
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,899
but Gamaliel stands up and says,

983
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:32,899
no, you're gonna be finding yourself to fight against God.

984
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,660
And we find that they agreed with Gamaliel,

985
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,420
so what they did is they beat the disciples,

986
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,860
and then they commanded them

987
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,239
not to speak in his name any longer.

988
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:46,739
But in verse 41, after all those things happened,

989
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:48,820
in Acts five and verse 41, the Bible says

990
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,100
that they departed from the presence of the council,

991
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,420
rejoicing that they were counted worthy

992
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,299
to suffer shame for his name,

993
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:57,179
and daily in the temple and every house,

994
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:01,059
they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

995
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,299
The disciples were able to endure

996
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,779
the persecution that they faced,

997
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:07,580
the afflictions that they dealt with, they endured,

998
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,940
they were able to continue.

999
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,580
They said that they departed from that place

1000
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,059
and they were rejoicing.

1001
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,260
They weren't rejoicing because they were delivered,

1002
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,220
they were rejoicing because they were counted worthy

1003
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,380
to suffer shame for the name of Christ.

1004
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,700
It's a perspective, it's a perspective.

1005
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Notice what Paul says in Acts chapter number 20,

1006
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,179
in verse number 24, he says this,

1007
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:31,940
as he's heading to Jerusalem,

1008
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,019
in fact, it's interesting, he's talking

1009
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:36,940
to the Ephesian church leaders in Acts chapter number 20,

1010
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,299
the very people that Timothy is now ministering there

1011
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:42,179
in that ministry, in that church,

1012
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,779
and Paul says this in Acts 20 and verse 24,

1013
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:46,820
but none of these things move me,

1014
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,820
neither count I my life dear unto myself

1015
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,980
so that I might finish my course with joy

1016
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,339
and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

1017
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:57,500
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

1018
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,260
You know what the problem is for many today

1019
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,100
is that we count our life dear unto ourselves.

1020
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,820
But Paul says, none of these things move me,

1021
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,220
neither count I my life dear unto myself.

1022
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,940
Paul says that I might know him, that I might win,

1023
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,100
that I might finish, that Paul has this perspective,

1024
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,820
Romans chapter 12, in verses one and two,

1025
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,100
Paul says this, I beseech you therefore, brethren,

1026
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,820
by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies

1027
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,779
a living sacrifice, wholly acceptable unto God,

1028
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:31,100
which is your reasonable service,

1029
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,700
and be not conformed to this world,

1030
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,940
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

1031
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,940
that ye might prove what is that good and perfect

1032
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,100
and acceptable will of God, sorry,

1033
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,899
the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

1034
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,420
And we find that Paul is giving a challenge

1035
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:46,820
to the believers in Rome, and he's saying, listen,

1036
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,619
present your bodies a living sacrifice,

1037
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,299
but I want you to understand this morning

1038
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:54,820
that the Apostle Paul was not asking other believers,

1039
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,739
he was not asking them to do something

1040
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:59,779
that he himself had not already done.

1041
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:02,220
The Apostle Paul is not encouraging Timothy

1042
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,899
to continue in the midst of persecution and affliction,

1043
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:08,339
and he himself gave up, no, he says,

1044
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,100
I've endured these things, I've suffered these things,

1045
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,179
I've seen God work.

1046
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:17,260
He says, present your bodies a living sacrifice,

1047
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,019
but here's what Paul says of himself in Galatians 2,

1048
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:23,299
in verse number 20, I am crucified with Christ.

1049
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,140
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,

1050
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,899
and the life that I now live in the flesh,

1051
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,700
I live by the faith of the Son of God

1052
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,619
who loved me and gave himself for me.

1053
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:37,700
Paul said, I'm crucified with Christ.

1054
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,940
You know what he's saying?

1055
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,059
He says it this way, I die daily, I'm dead with Christ.

1056
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,700
I'm dead, my old man is dead, I'm alive.

1057
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,100
Romans talks about being dead to the flesh,

1058
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,700
but alive unto God.

1059
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,100
And we find that Paul, as I referenced earlier,

1060
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,019
he says in Philippians 121,

1061
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:01,420
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

1062
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,059
Second Timothy, if you'll remember, in chapter two,

1063
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:09,580
one of the early on truths that we shared

1064
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,940
with regard to a good soldier,

1065
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,179
a good soldier endures hardness.

1066
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:16,260
He says in verse number three,

1067
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,700
thou therefore endure hardness

1068
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,220
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

1069
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,420
And so how can we endure?

1070
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,059
Can we endure?

1071
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,100
Listen, we are challenged this morning

1072
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,339
to prepare for persecution.

1073
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:32,500
We see the experience of the Apostle Paul,

1074
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,159
but we understand what we should expect.

1075
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:38,119
You say, pastor, I don't want to face persecution.

1076
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,640
I understand, and I'm in the same category that you're in.

1077
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,840
I don't want to face it.

1078
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,599
But what I don't want to do is have my head in the sand

1079
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,640
and pretend that it's never going to come

1080
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,919
and therefore not prepare for it.

1081
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:55,039
And then when it comes,

1082
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,280
I become vulnerable to the attack of the enemy.

1083
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,520
And I regret not preparing.

1084
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,679
As I use the illustration

1085
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,020
to start the service this morning,

1086
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,280
I'd rather prepare for the hurricane that never comes.

1087
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,239
Amen.

1088
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,200
Then to say, nah, it's not going to happen this time.

1089
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,320
And then to regret it.

1090
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,440
This morning, we have great promises in God's word

1091
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,679
with regard to his power.

1092
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,280
Romans eight, we're more than conquerors.

1093
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,000
First John chapter four,

1094
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,020
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

1095
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,299
Listen, we are overcomers.

1096
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:33,200
We are victorious, but thanks be to God,

1097
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,720
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1098
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,760
But as we live in this world,

1099
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,359
as we have the responsibility to live for Jesus,

1100
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,599
we're going to face some persecutions and some afflictions.

1101
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,679
You say, but all I was doing was obeying God.

1102
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:55,640
I just was sharing gospel tracks.

1103
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,880
I was just telling somebody about Jesus and they,

1104
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,780
yeah, yeah, that's what Paul was doing.

1105
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,880
He's just telling people about Jesus.

1106
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,880
He's just obeying God.

1107
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,280
He's just doing what God called him to do and he suffered.

1108
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:16,360
Can I tell you this morning that none of us have suffered the way Paul did or the way

1109
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,160
that many of our brothers and sisters in Christ are suffering around the globe today.

1110
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,440
And for that we ought to rejoice.

1111
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,500
God's given us an opportunity.

1112
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,400
He's given us some freedoms.

1113
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,240
But be aware this morning that the Bible is still true when it says in our text of scripture,

1114
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,120
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

1115
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:46,240
And oh that God would help us to be prepared for that day.

1116
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,040
Because we have an enemy that wants to cause you, to cause me, and to cause every child

1117
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,200
of God to quit, to stop.

1118
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,960
So he brings that persecution so that we just give up.

1119
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,480
But God says continue.

1120
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Let's pray together.

1121
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,480
Father we love you.

1122
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,480
We thank you for loving us.

1123
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,920
We thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

1124
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:19,600
God I pray this morning that you would help us to prepare properly for persecution.

1125
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:24,000
We acknowledge this morning that we hope the day never comes.

1126
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,600
That we'd suffer in the manner by which Paul and others have suffered.

1127
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,600
But God we know there are many in our world today that are suffering greatly for the cause

1128
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,520
of Christ.

1129
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,480
They're experiencing those persecutions and afflictions, those difficulties, but they're

1130
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,720
also experiencing your deliverance.

1131
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,600
And they're able to endure because of the truth that you've given to us in your word.

1132
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,120
And God I pray that you would help us this morning to prepare to endure.

1133
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,800
We thank you that you've overcome the world.

1134
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,400
We thank you this morning that you've given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

1135
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,880
That you've informed us with regard to what we should expect so that we can prepare accordingly.

1136
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,560
We pray that you'd move and work in this moment of invitation that you have your will and

1137
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,840
way through all that's said and done.

1138
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,120
In Christ's name we pray.

1139
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,120
Would you stand with me?
