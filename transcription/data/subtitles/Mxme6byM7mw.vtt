WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
the world in which we live and all the things that we face

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.599
and how we as the people of God must continue to go forward.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.359
Of course, you'll remember as we've studied

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
for so many weeks now through these two chapter

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.680
or these two books and through all of the months

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.360
of this calendar year here on Sunday mornings

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.680
that Timothy was ministering in Ephesus.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.680
And as he's ministering in Ephesus,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.120
he's dealing with false teachers,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.440
he's dealing with pressures

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
and all the things that are taking place.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.799
And Paul, if we could sum it up in one simple word

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.079
that we've used for our theme,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.200
Paul's encouragement to Timothy is continue.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.840
Just keep on keeping on,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
keep on doing what God has called you to do.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.560
And I'm so thankful that we too have been given a charge

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.279
to continue to serve the Lord.

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:45.840
We found as we studied last week

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.400
that 2 Timothy chapter number three

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.159
begins with these words, this know also.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.560
And we said that God wants his people to be informed.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.759
He wants us to understand certain things

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.759
with regard to the day in which we're living.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.580
Here in this passage of scriptures we studied last week,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
there were 20 particular characteristics that God gives us

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.160
with regard to the last days,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.120
the perilous times that we will be living in.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.839
And we find that as God reveals to Timothy

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:17.000
and to the church and to us as God's word

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.059
has been preserved, that he wants us to be informed of this.

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.160
He wants us to have knowledge

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.519
with regard to what will be the characteristics

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.040
of the days in which we live.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
We said this last week that we see all of these things

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.959
and we really see them increasing rapidly

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.919
in the day and age in which we're living.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:37.319
And so we're reminded that we're living in the last days,

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.319
but we're also equally reminded that our God's on the throne

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.959
and that he knew all about it.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.879
And he let us know, he informed us

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:46.599
and he wants us to be aware.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.360
It's interesting as you begin reading

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.080
in our text of scripture this morning

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.440
in verses 10 through 12, that the Bible starts this way,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.800
but thou hast fully known.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.879
And it's interesting because we find that Paul begins saying

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.959
to Timothy in verse number one, this know also.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.580
He wants them to be aware of the characteristics

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.520
of the last days, but then as he transitions

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.520
into verse number 10, he says, but thou hast fully known.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.679
Timothy was being informed about the apostasy

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.279
of the last days in the beginning of this chapter.

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.039
And then he's being reminded about the life and ministry

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.080
of the apostle Paul, who was his mentor.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.839
By the way, the apostle Paul, the mentor of Timothy,

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.880
remember Paul often refers to Timothy

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.479
as being his son in the faith.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.800
And we find that as his mentor, as Paul fulfilling that role

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.639
and seeking to influence and to instruct Timothy

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.919
and to encourage him to continue to serve the Lord,

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.080
that Paul says, you have fully known.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.360
You have known, and he goes through my doctrine,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.160
manner of life, purpose, faith, long suffering,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.279
charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions.

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.559
And we'll continue reading in just a moment,

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.699
but I want you to know that in a very bullet point

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.460
kind of a list that Paul says, you've known these things.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.960
You have fully known.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.160
We're once again reminded about the close relationship

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.880
that Paul and Timothy had and how Timothy was aware

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.160
of these things.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.559
And we find that it serves as a great example

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.720
to Timothy with regard to what he also would deal with.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.679
The subject of persecution is clear here

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.020
in our text of scripture.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.839
It's in clear view based upon the truth that we see

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.440
in verse number 12, of course,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.119
coupled with the references in verse number 11.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.339
We'll be looking simply at verses 10 through 12 this morning

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.199
as we deal with this thought, the title of the message,

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.160
preparation for persecution.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.059
Preparation for persecution.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.820
The Bible says in verse number 10,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.979
but thou hast fully known my doctrine,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.779
manner of life, purpose, faith, long suffering,

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:58.100
charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.100
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.940
What persecutions I endured, but out of them all,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.460
the Lord delivered me.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.059
Verse 12, yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.240
shall suffer persecution.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.880
As we look at this thought this morning

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.000
and deal with the subject of preparation for persecution,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.700
let me first make a few comments

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.500
with regard to the idea of preparation.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.859
As we think about preparation,

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:29.320
we understand that using that term to prepare for something

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.619
has a broad application.

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:34.220
You can prepare for a lot of different things.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.899
And we find that preparation, no doubt, is necessary.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:39.579
In fact, I could say it this way,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.220
I prepared for the message this morning.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.000
I prepared for the message that I'll preach this evening.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.700
Those that taught Sunday school this morning,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.859
they had a measure of preparation.

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:51.579
If you're gonna cook a meal, you have some preparation.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.899
You do some things ahead of time, you prepare.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.660
And we understand that it has a broad application

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.399
with regard to the subject of preparation.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:05.660
This morning, contextually from 2 Timothy chapter three,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.739
and what we're looking at is preparation for persecution.

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:12.140
Now, as I think about preparation,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.899
and I understand that there's a broad category of things,

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.140
application in which we could prepare for,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.239
I find this to be true also,

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:23.339
that there are times in which we prepare for something

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.820
that we actually hope never comes to pass.

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:30.779
So when I speak about preparation for persecution,

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.119
I'm saying prepare for something

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.019
that quite honestly tonight,

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:35.980
today, I'll say from this platform,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.480
and I believe that you probably would agree with me,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.540
I hope that I never have to face persecution.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.779
But the reality is that preparation for persecution

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.980
is absolutely necessary.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.940
And we find that though we would give this morning

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.059
the instruction that we ought to prepare

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:53.420
for the persecution,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.119
that we actually would hope that it never happens.

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.559
What do I mean by that?

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.700
Well, I lived, as you know, I was born in North Carolina,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.500
I lived a number of years in North Carolina,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.299
and I remember as a young child,

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:06.059
that there are many times in which you had,

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.820
during hurricane season,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.980
you had the threat of a storm

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.619
hitting the coast where we lived.

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.179
We weren't that far inland where we lived,

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:15.299
and there were several times

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:17.820
in which we had some pretty serious storms

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.100
that were coming, and the way that they were tracking it

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.820
looked like we were gonna get hit.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.260
And guess what we did?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.820
We made preparation.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.880
But in so doing, we made the preparation,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.299
but we also kind of hoped

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:31.260
that the storm wouldn't actually hit us,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.779
that we wouldn't deal with all of the damages

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.220
from the storm, but we made the preparation.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.059
Why?

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.700
In the event that the storm did follow the track

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.940
that the meteorologist assumed that it would.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.459
Now, here's the reality.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.459
When we made the preparation and the storm didn't come,

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.299
we weren't disappointed about the fact that we prepared.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.880
You know when you're disappointed if you didn't prepare?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.119
When the storm comes.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.339
The storm comes, and you say, you know what?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.100
Those guys don't know what they're talking about.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.339
They've said this before,

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.339
and they've always followed this track,

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.859
but it never happens, and we've been spared,

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.420
and I'm not gonna waste my time preparing,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.660
and then the storm comes, and guess what?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.260
You regret that you did not prepare.

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.260
In a very real sense,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.820
when we talk about the subject this morning

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.779
of preparation for persecution,

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.899
we find that we live and we have lived

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.859
in our lifetime here in the United States of America,

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:29.859
we've had great freedom and we've had great privilege.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.079
We had 18 that were out on visitation yesterday.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.500
We were knocking doors in our community,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.260
and we were going out and distributing literature

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.179
perfectly free to do that.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:41.299
We had no persecution whatsoever.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:44.799
There was no one, we have the freedom to do it.

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:46.739
Can I tell you this morning that that's not the case

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:48.559
everywhere around the globe?

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:51.100
There are places this morning around the globe

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.619
that they do not have the freedoms that we have,

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:56.100
and they have not had the freedoms that we have,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.739
and by the way, many places around the globe

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:01.640
that once had the freedoms that we enjoy today

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.880
no longer have those freedoms.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.920
You can read in the news about various countries,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.779
you can look at England and Scotland,

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.940
and you can look at Canada,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.779
and you can read things that have happened

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:16.220
even in recent weeks where their freedoms

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.279
are being squeezed and they're not having

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.579
the level of religious liberty that they once did.

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:28.320
As we think about this idea of preparation for persecution,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.880
I hope this morning that if persecution would come to us

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.119
in the sense in which we're gonna deal with this morning,

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.679
that we would be prepared for it

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.799
and that we'd be ready to stand.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.919
In the face of the opposition, in the face of adversity,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.919
that in the evil day, as Ephesians 6 says, we would stand.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.539
We find that as Paul is writing to Timothy

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:52.799
and Timothy is ministering in Ephesus,

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.919
it's interesting that Ephesians 6 deals with

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.760
all of this instruction with regard

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.239
to be strong in the Lord, put on the whole armor of God,

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:04.440
and Paul is writing to Timothy about the persecution

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.039
and preparing for such persecution.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:10.000
I believe this morning that if we fail to prepare

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.080
for persecution and persecution comes in your life

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.619
and in my life, that two things will be true.

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:18.520
Number one, we will regret not preparing,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.559
and number two, we will be vulnerable

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.000
to the attack of the enemy.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.679
And so this morning, we understand

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:28.320
that persecution is nothing new.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.080
In fact, if you study in the book of Acts

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.200
in the fourth chapter, the persecution begins.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.520
The church, of course, is born and God is working.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.599
Jesus Christ said, I will build my church

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:41.960
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.159
but we know that Satan hates the church,

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.320
Satan hates every child of God,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.119
and he's bringing persecution, he's bringing attack,

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:51.700
and what they started to do in Acts chapter number four

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.059
is they tried to threaten the people of God

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:56.320
to no longer speak the name of God

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.140
nor to preach the word of God,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.940
and we find that as they faced.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.060
various levels of persecution,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.100
whether that was being incarcerated,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.860
whether that was being interrogated,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.100
whether that was being beaten or threatened,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.780
we find that they faced great levels of persecution.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.180
You come to chapter number seven

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.860
and you find the first martyr of the New Testament church,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.740
with Stephen giving his life, and as he preached,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.540
and what a message he preached in Acts chapter number seven,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.700
he knew the Bible, he knew the scriptures,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.720
and he preached a powerful message,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.160
and there was great difficulty with regard

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.520
to what he faced as those people

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.520
that stood there and heard that message.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.080
They were cut to the heart.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.920
They were dealing with the truth

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.600
that had been given to them,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.920
and we find that as they responded with stoning him,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.600
and he looks up and he sees

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.020
as Jesus would welcome him to heaven,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.320
but then in chapter eight,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.200
the persecution rises a whole nother level.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.400
It increases, it intensifies,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.120
and the believers, they're scattered abroad,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.120
but here's what happened.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.160
As the enemy is fighting and the enemy is persecuting,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
the people of God are scattered.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.720
The apostles stay there in Jerusalem

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.080
according to the text of scripture,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.160
but we find that the people depart,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.000
and you know what they do?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.400
They went everywhere preaching the word,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.660
and so through persecution,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.180
you know what really happened is the church grew.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.120
The church multiplied.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.200
More people heard the gospel,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.840
and we find that starting in Acts four,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.200
and I gave you a very quick overview

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.520
of those few chapters in the book of Acts,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.959
but you find that throughout the entire church age,

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:35.860
persecution is nothing new to the people of God.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.000
Persecution is no new tactic.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.420
We find that the enemy of God's people,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.880
of God's church has sought to persecute,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.779
to cause the people of God to stop, to cease,

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:52.240
but yet God's people are to rise up and continue.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000
Notice with me in our text of scripture

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.520
in 2 Timothy chapter three this morning.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.900
I want you to notice number one, the experience.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.160
The experience.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.880
We find that the apostle Paul,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.959
he says to his son of the faith, Timothy,

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.000
he says, but thou hast fully known in verse number 10

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.160
my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.680
faith, longsuffering, charity, patience.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.900
I mean, that list, we could take each of those,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.800
and we could develop a message just from verse number 10,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.440
and dive in and see that the apostle Paul,

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.839
he says, you've fully known my doctrine,

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:28.479
the things that I believe, the things that I've taught,

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:29.500
the things that I've preached.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.240
Remember in just a few verses that the apostle Paul

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.320
will say all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.740
and is profitable, number one, for doctrine.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.119
Doctrine is important.

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:43.180
Remember that Timothy was left in Ephesus,

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.559
and he talks to them about the fact

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:47.720
that there were those that were bringing in false teachings

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.720
and that he must stand and must give forth sound words,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.880
sound doctrine, and we find that the apostle Paul,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.600
he says, you've known my doctrine.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.040
Not only have you known my doctrine,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.279
but you've known my manner of life.

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:03.400
Now think about that, Paul's behavior.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.400
It's interesting as you study the book of Acts

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.279
and you trace the steps of Paul,

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:11.800
you know what you find is that Paul had really a habit,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.520
if I could use that word this morning, in a positive sense.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.520
Everywhere he went, the Bible uses this word,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.680
as his manner was.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.119
He'd go in, and what'd he do?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.160
He'd go to the synagogue and he'd begin to preach.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.520
Why'd he go to the synagogue?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.600
Well, because that's where the people were gathered.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.400
And so he went to where the people were gathered

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.080
so that he could preach the word of God,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.520
so that he could reason with them out of the scriptures

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.360
and show them that this Jesus is Christ.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.139
And he goes, and this was his manner, and guess what?

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:43.400
When he would go, he would constantly face

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.400
the same level of resistance, of persecution, of opposition,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.479
but yet he'd leave one city and he'd go to another city

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:52.919
and he'd do the same exact thing.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.919
He'd go in and he'd preach the gospel,

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:58.440
and we find that Paul says, you've known my doctrine,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.240
but you've also known my manner of life.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.080
And by the way, if the message of your lips

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.760
does not align with the message of your life,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.600
you have a real hard time influencing people.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.839
But when the message of your lips

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:13.880
and the message of your life are consistent,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.320
as Paul says, you've known my doctrine,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.200
but you've also known my manner of life,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.200
you've fully known, then there's influence,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.519
there's impact, you see that it's a testimony

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.480
where I'm living out my belief.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.559
I've said it this way over the years,

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:34.140
my belief must impact, it will impact my behavior.

00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:39.760
What you believe to be true will impact your behavior,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.059
and how you behave will reveal what you believe.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.360
It's a coin that's, you can look at both sides,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.559
you can see my belief will impact my behavior,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:53.679
but then my behavior reveals what I believe.

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.360
You know why I don't jump off the roof?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.119
Because I believe in gravity, amen?

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:00.880
I believe that if I jump off that roof,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.920
I'm going down at, what is it, 9.8 meters per second,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.440
or whatever it is, I'm going down quick.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.679
I believe that, so I don't jump off the roof.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:12.239
And we find here this morning that when what we believe

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:15.000
to be true about God will impact our behavior,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.799
he says, you've fully known my doctrine,

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.959
my manner of life, my purpose.

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.160
Oh, Paul had a purpose.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.000
You know what his purpose was?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.760
To glorify God.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.880
His purpose was to please God in all that he,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.140
for me to live is Christ.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.160
Is that not what Paul said in Philippians chapter number one?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.239
We find that he said, you've known my faith.

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:35.279
Paul was a man of faith, he believed God.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.959
He stood up and proclaimed in Acts chapter 27,

00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:40.500
I believe God.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.799
By the way, that's not the only time

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:43.040
that Paul demonstrated faith.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.100
He was a man that believed that God was going to do

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.519
what God said he would do.

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.320
Every time he preached the gospel,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.160
you know what he was doing?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.839
He was exercising faith because he proclaimed,

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.480
for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.200
for it is the power of God unto salvation

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.080
to everyone that believe it,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.880
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.160
And since he believed that, his exercising in preaching,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.519
he was exercising faith in what he believed

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.600
was true that God said.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.880
He was living by faith.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.880
In fact, in that same passage of scripture

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.920
in Romans chapter number one, he says this,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.360
for the just shall live by faith.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.480
He's referencing back to the Old Testament

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.880
as he makes that declaration.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.000
Notice he says long-suffering.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.279
Oh, Paul was a man that was long-suffering.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:26.360
He was patient.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.600
He talks about his charity, his love.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.959
He talks about patience again.

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:31.080
You know what's interesting?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.559
As you look at some of these statements

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.600
that are made in verse number 10,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.320
you see the alignment with the fruit of the spirit

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.260
in Galatians chapter number five.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.080
And I'm thankful that Paul, he says,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.600
you've known these things.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.279
But then we get into verse number 11

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.080
and he mentions two additional things.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:51.040
He says persecutions, afflictions.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.600
The persecutions and afflictions.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.519
We find that Paul faced these difficulties.

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:58.000
I mentioned a moment ago that the goal of persecution

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.320
is to cause the individual that is being persecuted

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.959
to cease or to flee.

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:06.480
And we find this morning that as Paul says,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.839
you've known my persecutions,

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.080
you've known my afflictions, that contextually,

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.519
he says in verse 11, which came unto me at Antioch,

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:18.720
at Iconium, at Lystra.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.940
As we begin to think about these three cities

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.040
that the apostle Paul mentions by name in verse number 11,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.640
we find that this is a reference back

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.559
to the first missionary journey.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.279
If you were to go back in your Bibles to Acts 13 and 14,

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:33.360
you find that as Paul left the church at Antioch,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.440
as they were sent out, they were called of the Holy Spirit

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.440
to go and to enter into this ministry of taking the gospel.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.480
And we find that really in Acts 13 and 14,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.600
as we look at the first missionary journey,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.440
if you read the book of Galatians,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.080
he says unto the churches, plural, of Galatia.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.399
And what he's referencing is Galatia being a region,

00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:01.679
it's not the church of Galatia,

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.799
it's the churches in Galatia

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:06.839
because these churches were established

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:10.600
during this first missionary journey in Acts 13 and 14.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.880
But you know what happens?

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.000
As he leaves Antioch, they first, as they come,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.519
they enter into the first city.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:20.459
And as they come to the first city, they face opposition.

00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:22.920
I mean, there's opportunity that they have

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920
to be able to stand up in verse number 16.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.480
Then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hands,

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.239
said, men of Israel and you that fear God,

00:18:29.239 --> 00:18:32.159
give audience in Acts 13 in verse number 16.

00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:34.679
He begins to preach the word of God,

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:38.479
but we find that they had come to Antioch and Pisidian.

00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:39.960
That's the first city where they are

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.880
after they went through Perga

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.440
as you look at the beginning of chapter number 13.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.640
And he has opportunity,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.039
but it's not long after the opportunity

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:50.760
that he has this opposition.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.820
And we find that as they had opposition,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.460
they were run really out of town.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.080
In verse number 50, we're just kind of skipping through here

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.760
and you come to verse number 50 of Acts 13

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.720
and you find that the Bible says that the Jews

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.320
stirred up the devout and honorable women

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.940
and the chief men of the city

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.739
and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas

00:19:10.739 --> 00:19:13.820
and expelled them out of their coast.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.119
And so we find that the persecution was there

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:18.419
in chapter 14, they come to Iconium

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:20.840
and we find that is there in Iconium again,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.659
there's an opportunity to be able to preach

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:23.720
the word of God.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.859
In verse seven, it says there they preached the gospel.

00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:29.419
What a blessing to be able to see what's taking place,

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.220
but you come to verse 19 and you find that the Bible says

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.020
there came certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.820
who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul,

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.580
drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.780
The Bible says that he, Paul,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.119
they believe that he was dead after he faced this

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:51.539
and we're just kind of hitting a couple of highlights here

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:54.479
in Acts 13 and 14 during this first missionary journey

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:56.900
so that you can see, yes, there's opportunity,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.460
but there's opposition, there's persecution,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.299
there's a flip.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.299
What is it that he's facing the persecution for?

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:04.899
What is it that he's facing affliction for?

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:09.179
For obeying God, for preaching the gospel,

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:12.339
for simply obeying the Lord.

00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:14.079
God had given him a commission.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.219
God had given him a call,

00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:18.379
and we find that Paul is carrying forth

00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:21.559
that call that God had placed upon his life.

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:23.759
It's interesting for we find

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:26.499
that as Paul would face that persecution

00:20:26.499 --> 00:20:29.159
and he would deal with that cycle, if you will,

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.059
of an opportunity given followed by opposition,

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:35.959
that the Bible tells us in verse 20 of Acts 14,

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:38.359
after he'd been stoned in verse 19,

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:41.099
it says, how be it as the disciples stood round about him,

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:43.139
he rose up and came into the city,

00:20:43.139 --> 00:20:46.099
and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:48.479
And it's very interesting because he goes now to Derbe

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:50.379
and notice in verse 21 that the Bible says,

00:20:50.379 --> 00:20:52.379
and when they had preached the gospel

00:20:52.379 --> 00:20:54.579
to that city and had taught many,

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:58.959
they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:00.719
And he went back to the very cities

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.419
in which he had faced the persecution.

00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:04.259
He had boldness and he had courage

00:21:04.259 --> 00:21:07.459
and he was walking with the Lord and pleasing the Lord.

00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:09.059
And we find that Paul says,

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.939
listen, I've experienced some difficulty.

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:15.399
I've experienced some persecution and some affliction.

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:17.199
And Timothy, you know that,

00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:21.679
you fully are aware of what I have experienced.

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:23.619
And Paul is sharing that experience.

00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:26.719
We could look this morning at a variety of passages.

00:21:26.739 --> 00:21:29.179
Let me just use one more in Acts 23

00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:33.019
and let me show you here what's happening in Acts 23.

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:34.999
In fact, this is a portion of scripture

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:39.939
that causes me to laugh often as I look at the situation

00:21:39.939 --> 00:21:42.099
that's unfolding here in Acts 23

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:45.159
and how God worked so miraculously.

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:47.659
But we find the beginning in verse number 11,

00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:49.139
the Bible says in the night following,

00:21:49.139 --> 00:21:52.519
the Lord stood by him and said, be of good cheer, Paul,

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:55.099
for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem,

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:58.399
so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

00:21:58.399 --> 00:22:01.079
By the way, that right there

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:03.539
is enough to keep someone going for the Lord.

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.679
God spoke to him and said,

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.759
you've testified of me at Jerusalem

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.279
and you're gonna testify of me at Rome.

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:14.239
And Paul believed that God was going to bring to pass

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:16.159
what God revealed to him.

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:18.119
But it's interesting because the Bible says

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:20.519
in verse number 12, and when it was day,

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:23.059
certain of the Jews banded together

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:25.479
and bound themselves under a curse,

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:27.519
saying that they would neither eat nor drink

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:30.439
till they had killed Paul.

00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:32.159
Now what's interesting to me about this

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:36.959
is the fact that God gave Paul a promise in verse number 11

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:38.699
and then in verse number 12,

00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:42.399
these men make this covenant really with one another

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:44.299
that they're going to kill Paul.

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:45.999
I believe that they died

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:48.879
or they pulled back on their covenant

00:22:48.879 --> 00:22:51.879
because they had to either eat or drink or they died

00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.739
because they never killed Paul, amen?

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.059
God kept them safe.

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:56.259
Notice in verse number 13,

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.379
the Bible says, and they were more than 40,

00:22:58.379 --> 00:23:00.819
which had made this conspiracy.

00:23:00.819 --> 00:23:02.939
And they came to the chief priests and elders and said,

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:05.019
we have bound ourselves under a great curse

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:07.979
that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.

00:23:07.979 --> 00:23:11.059
Now, therefore, ye with the council

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:12.939
signify to the chief captain

00:23:12.939 --> 00:23:15.459
that he bring him down unto you tomorrow

00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:17.099
as though you would inquire something

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:18.959
more perfectly concerning him.

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:22.979
And we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:24.259
And so they got their plan.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.179
They say, hey, we want you to bring him out.

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:27.019
And as you bring him,

00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:27.859
because you're going to act like

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:28.939
you got more questions for him,

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:30.339
man, we're going to be waiting for him

00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:32.739
and we're going to take his life.

00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:34.739
The Bible tells us in verse number 16

00:23:34.739 --> 00:23:37.739
that Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait.

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:40.259
He went and entered into the castle and told Paul.

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:43.499
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him and said,

00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:45.579
bring this young man under the chief captain

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:48.599
for he has a certain thing to tell him.

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:51.339
So he took him and brought him to the chief captain

00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:54.219
and said, Paul, the prisoner called me unto him

00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:56.459
and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee

00:23:56.459 --> 00:23:58.779
who has something to say unto thee.

00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:00.779
Then the chief captain took him by the hand

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:03.299
and went with him aside privately and asked him,

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:06.299
what is that thou hast to tell me?

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:08.499
And he said, the Jews have agreed to desire thee

00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:11.019
that thou wouldest bring down Paul tomorrow

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:13.539
into the council as though they would inquire

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:16.539
somewhat of him more perfectly.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.720
But do not thou yield unto them

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.440
for there lie in wait for him of them more than 40 men

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.839
which have bound themselves with an oath

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:25.440
that they will neither eat nor drink

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.299
till they have killed him.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:30.639
And now are they ready looking for a promise from thee.

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:34.479
So the chief captain then let the young man depart

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:36.679
and charged him, see thou tell no man

00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:38.319
that thou has showed these things to me.

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:41.159
And he called unto him two centurions saying,

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:45.199
make ready 200 soldiers to go to Caesarea

00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:48.959
and horsemen threescore and 10 and spearmen 200

00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:51.220
at the third hour of the night.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.059
How many bound themselves under an oath?

00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:53.899
40.

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:58.259
And here they gathered together 200 soldiers,

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:00.259
70 horsemen and 200 spearmen.

00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:05.559
God was protecting his man.

00:25:07.179 --> 00:25:09.139
And the Bible says in verse number 24,

00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:12.739
and provided them beast that they may set Paul on,

00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:16.119
notice these words and bring him safe

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:19.119
unto Felix the governor.

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:20.559
You know what happened?

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.019
Paul was brought safe.

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:24.959
Because as we look in our text of scripture,

00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:28.679
not only did the experience of Paul include difficulty,

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:32.279
but it included deliverance.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:34.479
The experience of Paul was one of difficulty,

00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:35.599
but also of deliverance.

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:37.319
Notice in verse number 11,

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:39.759
back in our text in 2 Timothy chapter three,

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:41.739
he says, persecutions, afflictions,

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:45.359
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:47.319
what persecutions I endured,

00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.599
but notice the end of verse number 11,

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:54.159
but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

00:25:55.059 --> 00:25:57.199
Listen, you might face some difficulty,

00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:58.859
I might face some difficulty,

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:01.519
but I'm so thankful for the deliverance of our God.

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:04.079
I'm so thankful that our God is able to deliver us.

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:07.679
We sing about God's ability, he is able to deliver thee.

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:09.479
It's a great hymn that we sing.

00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:12.720
And it's a reminder to us that God is able.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.799
I'm reminded of those three Hebrew children

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:17.839
in the book of Daniel, when they stand before Nebuchadnezzar,

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:20.519
the powerful king of Babylon,

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:23.759
and they say, our God is able.

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:27.720
And if not, be it known, we're not gonna bow,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.879
we're not gonna give in,

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:31.000
we'll go through that fiery furnace.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.399
And they understood, and listen,

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:35.239
many a people have understood throughout the history

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:38.399
of the church that God will deliver his people.

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:40.799
It may be that he delivers us through the storm,

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.279
it may be that he delivers us from the storm,

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:45.399
but God will deliver.

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:49.819
Many people have died for the cause of Christ.

00:26:49.819 --> 00:26:53.479
But can I tell you that God delivered them?

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:55.119
Because here's the deliverance,

00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:58.679
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:26:58.679 --> 00:26:59.639
Amen.

00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:01.899
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:03.839
Paul said, for to me to live is Christ,

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:07.759
but to die is gain.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.759
What is the gain?

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:10.519
You know that many people in our world today

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.359
do not have that perspective that death is gain.

00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:16.039
Many people in our world today actually fear dying

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:17.679
because they have no idea,

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.519
they have no assurance or confidence

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:21.479
what will happen when they die.

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:23.039
They have the fear of death

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:24.699
that the book of Hebrews speaks of,

00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:27.519
but I'm thankful that my God conquered sin,

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:28.479
death, and the grave.

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:30.000
He's alive forevermore,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.599
and he's given to us the deliverance from the fear of death.

00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:38.619
And we find that Paul says that I suffered these things,

00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:40.819
I experienced great difficulty,

00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:42.319
but I want you to know, Timothy,

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:44.519
that not only did I experience difficulty,

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:47.079
but I experienced deliverance.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:48.639
I'm thankful for the full picture

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:51.119
that God gives us in this passage of Scripture.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.500
I'm thankful for the examples

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.319
that God has given us in his word

00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:56.959
that we can go to and that we can see

00:27:56.959 --> 00:27:59.379
how God delivered his people.

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:01.720
It's interesting, in Acts 25,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720
if you look at verses one through four,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.399
that you see another, a miraculous situation

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.940
where the apostle Paul was dealing with people

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.039
that were trying to persuade those in authority

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:18.039
to cause Paul to come in order that he might be killed.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.679
And in Acts chapter 25, it was Festus that came,

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.379
and the Bible says that he ascended

00:28:23.379 --> 00:28:27.039
from Caesarea to Jerusalem in verse number one of Acts 25.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.599
And so if you get in your mind's eye,

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:31.639
what he did is he left Caesarea and he went to Jerusalem.

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:33.559
He took this journey to go there

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:36.399
from his place in Caesarea to go to Jerusalem.

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:39.239
And so the high priest and the chief of the Jews

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:41.839
informed him against Paul and besought him.

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:43.799
Here's what they desired for him to do.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:47.839
They desired that they would bring Paul to Jerusalem.

00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:48.679
Why?

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:51.399
So that they would have opportunity to kill him.

00:28:51.399 --> 00:28:53.119
You know what Festus says?

00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:57.859
No, I'll go back to Caesarea and I'll hear him there.

00:28:57.859 --> 00:28:58.919
You read in verse number four.

00:28:58.919 --> 00:29:00.119
And this is amazing to me.

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:03.039
What's so amazing to me is that this man, Festus,

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:05.679
just left Caesarea to go to Jerusalem,

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:08.399
and then it would have been much more convenient

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:12.140
for him to simply have Paul come from Caesarea to Jerusalem

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.440
to hear him there.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.279
By the way, those that would bring the charges against Paul

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:17.919
were already in Jerusalem,

00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:19.500
and it would have been much more convenient.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.339
But guess what?

00:29:20.339 --> 00:29:22.279
My God was at work.

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:24.760
And God moved in the heart of Festus to say,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.880
no, I'm gonna go back up there to Caesarea.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.479
And if you guys wanna bring accusation against him,

00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:32.080
if you wanna come for the trial,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.799
you come up to Caesarea,

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:36.200
and that's where we'll have the trial.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.080
Listen, our God is able.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.080
And can I tell you that he works in ways

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.979
that we don't always understand.

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:45.200
But our God's always at work.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.599
He's always at work.

00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:48.200
And I'm thankful for that.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.719
We see number one, the experience.

00:29:49.719 --> 00:29:51.239
I want you to look at verse number 12

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:54.799
and see number two with me this morning, the expectation.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:57.239
We find that there's an experience that Paul shares

00:29:57.599 --> 00:29:59.080
with his son in the faith.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.880
The fact that there's going to be.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.220
There's going to be difficulty, there's going to be persecution and affliction.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.720
He endured that, he suffered that, but he also experienced the deliverance of God.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.600
And now we see the expectation in verse number 12.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600
It says,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:20.720
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.680
You say, I don't like that verse.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.240
It's God's Word.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.840
It's God's Word.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.600
And we find here this morning that I am thankful and you should be thankful this morning that

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.120
God lets us know what we should expect.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.180
For in so doing, he gives us the opportunity to prepare for what will come.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.000
And that's gracious of our God to do that.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.080
It's gracious of our God to let us know what we should expect.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.400
And we see it revealed to us in verse number 12.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.040
Paul, listen, there's some today that are these prosperity preachers that preach heresy.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.120
That tell you, oh, just give your life to Jesus and everything's going to be perfectly

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.920
good and you're going to have wealth and health and so on and so forth.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:13.040
Listen, 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 12, Paul is telling Timothy, listen, serve

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.600
God, continue, don't give up in Ephesus, don't give in to the pressures.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.320
I know that there are false teachers.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.960
I know that you're dealing with opposition.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.600
I know all that's happening.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.840
But I want you to continue.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.320
I want you to keep serving God.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.880
I want you to be faithful where God has planted you to do what God has called you to do.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.280
And yes, I've experienced some things, but Timothy, let me inform you that you too should

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:42.720
expect to suffer persecution.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.840
And in so doing, Timothy would then have the opportunity just as we do this morning to

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.480
prepare for such a day.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.400
Here in verse number 12, the Bible says, yea, and all that will live godly in Christ

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.120
Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.320
Again, the goal of persecution is to cause the individual that's being persecuted to

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.840
cease, to flee, to give up, to give in under the pressures.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.360
In John 15 and verse number 18, let me remind you of some words of Jesus in the gospel of

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.520
John.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.520
In John chapter 15, 16, and 17, I'm going to look at a few verses in each of those chapters

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.919
this morning to help you be reminded of what Jesus said to his disciples.

00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:33.440
In John 15 and verse number 18, the Bible says this, if the world hates you, you know

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.080
that it hated me before it hated you.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.840
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.800
But because you're not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.800
the world hateth you.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.639
By the way, I'm thankful I'm not in the world.

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:51.639
Amen?

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:54.120
I'm not, listen, this world is not my home.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.279
I've been saved by the grace of God.

00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:59.639
If you're saved this morning, then you're not of the world either.

00:32:59.639 --> 00:33:03.840
Yes, I understand John 17, we're still in the world, but we're not of the world.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.680
My citizenship is in heaven.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.600
And so he says, if you were of the world, the world would love his own.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.520
But because we're not of the world, he says, listen, if the world hates you, don't be surprised

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520
at that.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.540
Don't be surprised when you face the opposition, the persecution, why?

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.279
Because it hated me, Jesus says, before it's ever going to hate you.

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:27.000
John 16, verse number one, the Bible says, these things have I spoken unto you that ye

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.400
should not be offended.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.040
Then they shall put you out of the synagogues, yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.960
you will think that he doeth God's service.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.360
And these things will they do unto you, why?

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.940
Because they have not known the Father nor me.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.480
But these things I have told you that when the time shall come, you may remember that

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.480
I told you of them.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.639
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:56.580
But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, whither goest thou?

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.960
He tells him in verse number seven, nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960
you that I go away.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.720
For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.919
But if I depart, I will send him unto you.

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:11.440
Jesus is letting the disciples know, he said, these things have I spoken unto you.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.639
Listen, there's coming a day you're going to have opposition and affliction and persecution.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.320
And I want you to understand these things.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.880
I want you to remember that I'm telling you these things.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.320
And by the way, verse seven, it's expedient that I go away.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.200
It is absolutely necessary, why?

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.040
Because if I go away, he goes to the cross, he's buried, he rises, he ascends to heaven,

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.279
then he's gonna send the comforter, the Holy Spirit.

00:34:34.279 --> 00:34:38.480
By the way, I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God indwells me today.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.720
And what a gift that God has given to us.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.200
And he says to us this morning that it's expedient that I go away.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.839
In verse number 33 of John 16, he says, these things have I spoken unto you that you might

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:50.760
have peace.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.360
In the world, you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.920
I have overcome the world.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.600
We serve the risen Christ.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.160
We serve the one who is the King of kings and Lord of lords, the one that conquered

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.820
sin, death, and the grave.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.800
He is alive forevermore.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.119
And he's told us that we're to be of good cheer, that we're to have that peace that

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:12.600
he offers.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:20.119
In John 17, in verse number 14, notice the Bible says this, I have given them thy word,

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:22.600
and the world hath hated them.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.600
Why?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.959
Because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:31.360
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.119
them from the evil.

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:37.160
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.320
Sanctify them through thy truth.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.279
Thy word is truth.

00:35:40.279 --> 00:35:45.559
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:50.239
And for their sakes, I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:51.239
truth.

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:52.239
Notice this in verse number 20.

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:54.160
It's a precious verse of Scripture.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.179
The Bible says, neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:00.720
through their word.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.480
You know, this is perpetuity.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.520
This is every Christian, every person that's ever been born again, the Bible is speaking

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.580
of in verse 20, where Jesus says, I'm praying for them, but not for them alone.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.059
He says, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:20.040
As the gospel has been proclaimed throughout the centuries, people have been saved by the

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.980
grace of God, and Jesus sees that in this prayer, and he mentions that in verse 20.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:31.320
Verse 21, that they all may be one as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.559
also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:41.679
And so we find that there's Jesus, as he's teaching the disciples, as he's preparing

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:46.940
them for his soon going to the cross of Calvary, he's telling them, listen, you can expect

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.600
that you're going to have tribulation, you're going to have persecution, you're going to

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.160
have affliction, but be of good cheer, for I've overcome the world.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.760
Notice in Acts 14, in verse number 22, notice what the Bible says.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:04.880
We referenced this portion of Scripture earlier, and we find that as we look here in Acts 14

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.959
and verse 22 specifically, as Paul left and he goes to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,

00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:17.440
back to those cities during the first missionary journey, notice in verse 22 what he says.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:23.800
It says this, confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.880
the faith.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.179
And then our theme, continue.

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:31.220
Notice he's exhorting them to continue in the faith, but then notice, and that we must

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:35.619
through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:38.580
In this world you shall have tribulation.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.380
You're going to deal with persecution, you're going to deal with affliction, yea?

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.760
And all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.739
So he's given us, he's revealed to us what we should expect as we live for Christ.

00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:54.459
In 1 Peter chapter 4, Peter is writing to a group of people that are suffering great

00:37:54.459 --> 00:37:58.679
persecution in 1 Peter throughout the book.

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:04.459
We find that these people are in need of comfort, we find that God in the very first chapter

00:38:04.459 --> 00:38:11.459
of the book of 1 Peter, he's encouraging them through this truth with regard to the trying

00:38:11.459 --> 00:38:15.300
fire of the Lord and what it produces.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:21.339
The refining process, the refining fire, if we can use that terminology this morning.

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:25.480
And he says this to these believers in 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse number 6.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:31.559
He says wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you're in heaviness

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:34.179
through manifold temptations.

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:38.020
And every time, and I know I mention it every time I read this verse of scripture, he says

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:42.479
though now for a season, what I'm thankful for is a season is not forever.

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:46.940
I don't know how long the season is, you don't know how long the season is, but I know that

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.220
the season will end.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.340
It's not forever.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.299
He says at the end of 2 Peter in chapter number 3 that you suffer for a while, again

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.739
a while is not forever, amen.

00:38:57.739 --> 00:39:01.700
And you say, but it's been a long while, I understand and God knows and he knows all

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.859
about it and his timing is perfect and he's able, but I want you to understand this morning,

00:39:06.859 --> 00:39:08.840
it's not forever.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.919
He says if need be in verse number 6, listen, God knows what we need and he knows what to

00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:18.619
bring in our lives to refine us, to cause us to be conformed to the image of his dear

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:19.619
son.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.260
And I'm remembering in my personal devotions from Romans chapter number 8, I was reading

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.580
several chapters there, but in chapter number 8, in verse number 29 that God, he predestinated

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.179
us to be conformed to the image of his dear son.

00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:33.859
I'm to be like Christ.

00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:36.220
Christ suffered.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.859
He faced great difficulty.

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:42.140
We find that there are times in which God knows, listen, he knows what we need more

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.140
than we know what we need.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.539
You say, I don't need this right now.

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:50.140
God knows and God's in control and God has a purpose.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.299
You say, but the storm is too much for me.

00:39:52.299 --> 00:39:54.580
God's in control, rest.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.220
Let God have his way, learn the lesson.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.940
Notice verse 7 of 1 Peter 1, that the trial of your faith.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.740
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.200
though it be tried with fire,

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.940
might be found unto praise and honor and glory

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.320
at the appearing of Jesus Christ,

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.120
whom having not seen ye love,

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.880
in whom though now ye see him not yet believing,

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.880
ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.840
Just think about the rejoicing that's mentioned here

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.220
in a season of great trial and difficulty.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.260
In chapter number four, in verse number 12,

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.680
we find that Peter says to these believers,

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.780
again, as we understand the expectation,

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.900
he says, beloved, in verse number 12,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.320
think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.660
which is to try you,

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.360
as though some strange thing happened unto you.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.180
No, think it not strange.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.940
Why does he say think it not strange?

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.420
Well, because Jesus already told us

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.100
that this is what we're gonna face.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.300
He already revealed to us,

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.780
he's already let us know that this is what we should expect.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.020
We should expect these things in the world.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.860
Why?

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.680
If the world hates you,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.180
remember that it hated him first,

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.460
and we're not of the world.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.819
And so we find that he says, think it not strange.

00:41:07.819 --> 00:41:10.139
Yes, I know that you're in a fiery trial.

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:11.600
I know that you're dealing with this,

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.180
but it's not a strange thing,

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.100
because we find that we understand

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.220
that this is what we should expect.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.740
He says in verse 13, but rejoice,

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.180
inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's suffering,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.500
that when his glory shall be revealed,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.700
you may be glad also with exceeding joy.

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:32.020
He tells us in verse 14,

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:37.020
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.700
The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.340
On their part is evil spoken of,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.980
but on your part, he is glorified.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.060
I'm always convicted when I read of those

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.880
that gave their life for Christ,

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.779
literally those that were burned at the stake.

00:41:53.779 --> 00:41:56.100
As they're literally being burned to death,

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.380
how they're singing and rejoicing and testifying.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.959
It convicts me when I read those accounts.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.139
Because truly, as we look in 1 Peter 4,

00:42:07.139 --> 00:42:08.819
happy are ye.

00:42:08.819 --> 00:42:10.220
They're rejoicing.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.220
So the question really comes down to this

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.139
as we wrap up the message this morning.

00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:18.300
We see the experience, we see the expectation,

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.660
but I want you to notice very quickly here

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.059
in the middle of the verse of scripture,

00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:25.779
in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 11,

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.779
I want you to see specifically what Paul says

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:31.139
right in the midst of the verse.

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:33.779
And we're gonna look at this and close this morning.

00:42:33.779 --> 00:42:35.500
He says, persecutions, afflictions,

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.320
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.720
But then notice this phrase, what persecutions I endured.

00:42:44.279 --> 00:42:45.940
But out of them all, the Lord delivered me.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.040
We talked about the experience.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.419
We talked about the expectation.

00:42:49.419 --> 00:42:51.680
Now I want you to consider the enduring.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.440
How do I endure?

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.380
How did Paul, how was he able to say

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.020
what persecutions I endured?

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.020
What was it about the Apostle Paul?

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.979
What was it about his life that enabled him

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:05.380
to endure those things that he experienced,

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.580
that allowed him to go from city to city,

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.699
from place to place and preach the gospel

00:43:09.699 --> 00:43:12.820
and face the persecution and the opposition

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.740
and the tribulation that he faced, but yet to continue?

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.740
What was it that allowed him to endure?

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.580
What is it that will enable you?

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.559
What is it that will enable me this morning

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:24.460
to endure when persecution comes?

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.460
Because truly, that's the idea

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.180
of preparation for persecution.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.220
See, do I wanna cave in when the persecution comes,

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.460
when the opposition comes?

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.020
Do I wanna cave in and crumble and give up

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.699
and throw in the towel, or do I wanna continue,

00:43:39.699 --> 00:43:41.139
and how can I continue?

00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:43.580
Is it an idea that I just pull myself up

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.320
by my own bootstraps, that I just kinda man up?

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.820
No, because the outward man will perish,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.260
but it's the inward man that's renewed day by day.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.460
And we need to have not physical strength,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.779
because we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:43:57.779 --> 00:43:59.320
but we need to have spiritual strength.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.919
We need to be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:04.740
We need to put on the whole armor of God

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.940
that we might be able to stand in that evil day.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.380
You know, it's amazing the disciples,

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.740
they were able to endure.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.380
We've mentioned much about the Apostle Paul this morning

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.220
as he's the one writing to Timothy, his son in the faith,

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.779
but in Acts chapter number five,

00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:21.540
after the disciples faced some serious persecution,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.339
it started in chapter four, it continues in chapter five,

00:44:24.339 --> 00:44:27.420
and they wanna kill him, they wanna put him to death,

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.899
but Gamaliel stands up and says,

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:32.899
no, you're gonna be finding yourself to fight against God.

00:44:32.899 --> 00:44:35.660
And we find that they agreed with Gamaliel,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.420
so what they did is they beat the disciples,

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.860
and then they commanded them

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.239
not to speak in his name any longer.

00:44:43.739 --> 00:44:46.739
But in verse 41, after all those things happened,

00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:48.820
in Acts five and verse 41, the Bible says

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.100
that they departed from the presence of the council,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.420
rejoicing that they were counted worthy

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.299
to suffer shame for his name,

00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:57.179
and daily in the temple and every house,

00:44:57.179 --> 00:45:01.059
they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:02.299
The disciples were able to endure

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:04.779
the persecution that they faced,

00:45:04.779 --> 00:45:07.580
the afflictions that they dealt with, they endured,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.940
they were able to continue.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.580
They said that they departed from that place

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.059
and they were rejoicing.

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:16.260
They weren't rejoicing because they were delivered,

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.220
they were rejoicing because they were counted worthy

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.380
to suffer shame for the name of Christ.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.700
It's a perspective, it's a perspective.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.700
Notice what Paul says in Acts chapter number 20,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.179
in verse number 24, he says this,

00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:31.940
as he's heading to Jerusalem,

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.019
in fact, it's interesting, he's talking

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:36.940
to the Ephesian church leaders in Acts chapter number 20,

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.299
the very people that Timothy is now ministering there

00:45:40.299 --> 00:45:42.179
in that ministry, in that church,

00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:44.779
and Paul says this in Acts 20 and verse 24,

00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:46.820
but none of these things move me,

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.820
neither count I my life dear unto myself

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.980
so that I might finish my course with joy

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.339
and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

00:45:54.339 --> 00:45:57.500
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:00.260
You know what the problem is for many today

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.100
is that we count our life dear unto ourselves.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.820
But Paul says, none of these things move me,

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.220
neither count I my life dear unto myself.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.940
Paul says that I might know him, that I might win,

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.100
that I might finish, that Paul has this perspective,

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.820
Romans chapter 12, in verses one and two,

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.100
Paul says this, I beseech you therefore, brethren,

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.820
by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.779
a living sacrifice, wholly acceptable unto God,

00:46:29.779 --> 00:46:31.100
which is your reasonable service,

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.700
and be not conformed to this world,

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.940
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.940
that ye might prove what is that good and perfect

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.100
and acceptable will of God, sorry,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.899
the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.420
And we find that Paul is giving a challenge

00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:46.820
to the believers in Rome, and he's saying, listen,

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.619
present your bodies a living sacrifice,

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:51.299
but I want you to understand this morning

00:46:51.299 --> 00:46:54.820
that the Apostle Paul was not asking other believers,

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.739
he was not asking them to do something

00:46:56.739 --> 00:46:59.779
that he himself had not already done.

00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:02.220
The Apostle Paul is not encouraging Timothy

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.899
to continue in the midst of persecution and affliction,

00:47:05.899 --> 00:47:08.339
and he himself gave up, no, he says,

00:47:08.339 --> 00:47:11.100
I've endured these things, I've suffered these things,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.179
I've seen God work.

00:47:15.059 --> 00:47:17.260
He says, present your bodies a living sacrifice,

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.019
but here's what Paul says of himself in Galatians 2,

00:47:20.019 --> 00:47:23.299
in verse number 20, I am crucified with Christ.

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:26.140
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.899
and the life that I now live in the flesh,

00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:29.700
I live by the faith of the Son of God

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.619
who loved me and gave himself for me.

00:47:33.619 --> 00:47:37.700
Paul said, I'm crucified with Christ.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.940
You know what he's saying?

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:43.059
He says it this way, I die daily, I'm dead with Christ.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.700
I'm dead, my old man is dead, I'm alive.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.100
Romans talks about being dead to the flesh,

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.700
but alive unto God.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.100
And we find that Paul, as I referenced earlier,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.019
he says in Philippians 121,

00:47:58.019 --> 00:48:01.420
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.059
Second Timothy, if you'll remember, in chapter two,

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:09.580
one of the early on truths that we shared

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.940
with regard to a good soldier,

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.179
a good soldier endures hardness.

00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:16.260
He says in verse number three,

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.700
thou therefore endure hardness

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:21.220
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.420
And so how can we endure?

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.059
Can we endure?

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:28.100
Listen, we are challenged this morning

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.339
to prepare for persecution.

00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:32.500
We see the experience of the Apostle Paul,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.159
but we understand what we should expect.

00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:38.119
You say, pastor, I don't want to face persecution.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.640
I understand, and I'm in the same category that you're in.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.840
I don't want to face it.

00:48:44.119 --> 00:48:48.599
But what I don't want to do is have my head in the sand

00:48:48.599 --> 00:48:50.640
and pretend that it's never going to come

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.919
and therefore not prepare for it.

00:48:52.919 --> 00:48:55.039
And then when it comes,

00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:58.280
I become vulnerable to the attack of the enemy.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.520
And I regret not preparing.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.679
As I use the illustration

00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:04.020
to start the service this morning,

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.280
I'd rather prepare for the hurricane that never comes.

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:11.239
Amen.

00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:14.200
Then to say, nah, it's not going to happen this time.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.320
And then to regret it.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.440
This morning, we have great promises in God's word

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.679
with regard to his power.

00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:25.280
Romans eight, we're more than conquerors.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.000
First John chapter four,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.020
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.299
Listen, we are overcomers.

00:49:31.299 --> 00:49:33.200
We are victorious, but thanks be to God,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.720
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:42.760
But as we live in this world,

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.359
as we have the responsibility to live for Jesus,

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:51.599
we're going to face some persecutions and some afflictions.

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:53.679
You say, but all I was doing was obeying God.

00:49:53.679 --> 00:49:55.640
I just was sharing gospel tracks.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.880
I was just telling somebody about Jesus and they,

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.780
yeah, yeah, that's what Paul was doing.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.880
He's just telling people about Jesus.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880
He's just obeying God.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.280
He's just doing what God called him to do and he suffered.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:16.360
Can I tell you this morning that none of us have suffered the way Paul did or the way

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.160
that many of our brothers and sisters in Christ are suffering around the globe today.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.440
And for that we ought to rejoice.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.500
God's given us an opportunity.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.400
He's given us some freedoms.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:35.240
But be aware this morning that the Bible is still true when it says in our text of scripture,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:40.120
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:46.240
And oh that God would help us to be prepared for that day.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.040
Because we have an enemy that wants to cause you, to cause me, and to cause every child

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.200
of God to quit, to stop.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.960
So he brings that persecution so that we just give up.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.480
But God says continue.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480
Let's pray together.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480
Father we love you.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480
We thank you for loving us.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.920
We thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:19.600
God I pray this morning that you would help us to prepare properly for persecution.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.000
We acknowledge this morning that we hope the day never comes.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.600
That we'd suffer in the manner by which Paul and others have suffered.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.600
But God we know there are many in our world today that are suffering greatly for the cause

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.520
of Christ.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.480
They're experiencing those persecutions and afflictions, those difficulties, but they're

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.720
also experiencing your deliverance.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:52.600
And they're able to endure because of the truth that you've given to us in your word.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:59.120
And God I pray that you would help us this morning to prepare to endure.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.800
We thank you that you've overcome the world.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:08.400
We thank you this morning that you've given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:14.880
That you've informed us with regard to what we should expect so that we can prepare accordingly.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.560
We pray that you'd move and work in this moment of invitation that you have your will and

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.840
way through all that's said and done.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.120
In Christ's name we pray.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.120
Would you stand with me?
