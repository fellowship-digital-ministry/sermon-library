1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,079
chapter number two this evening, Revelation chapter two,

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,679
and we're looking at verses 20 through 29.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,159
It's really part two.

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:10,779
Last Sunday evening, we had the Lord's Supper,

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,640
and so I preached from 1 Corinthians chapter number 11.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,279
And so you gotta go a couple of weeks back

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,680
in your memory bank in order to remember the first part

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,459
of the church in Thyatira.

9
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,739
And that message was preached a couple of weeks ago.

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,879
And in that study, we examined, if you will,

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,819
the praise for the church in Thyatira.

12
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,579
We mentioned some things about the church,

13
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,020
but then we got to verse number 19, excuse me,

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,659
and the Bible says, I know thy works.

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,599
And we've mentioned that each of these churches

16
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,900
that are addressed in the book of Revelation,

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,700
they're literal churches, they're local churches

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,060
that are existing at the time of the writing.

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,740
And to each of them, the Lord Jesus Christ,

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,099
the head of the church, the one who is to have preeminence,

21
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,900
says, I know thy works.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,520
And we said this about the church in Thyatira,

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,720
that as the Lord commends this church

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,959
and offers praise with regard to their works,

25
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,879
you find in verse number 19 that it ends by saying,

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,599
and the last to be more than the first.

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,639
And we made note that the church was a church

28
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:14,239
that was growing, and a church ought to be growing.

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,519
And we mentioned five particular areas

30
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,519
that are referenced in verse 19 of Revelation 2

31
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,160
in which this church was growing.

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,040
They were growing in their works.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
They were growing in charity.

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,760
They were growing in service.

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,199
They were growing in faith.

36
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,480
And they were growing in patience.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,360
And we looked at each of those areas specifically,

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
and we were rejoicing in the fact

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
that a church was growing.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It is God's design for individual believers to grow.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,559
A church is made up of individual believers,

42
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:50,279
and therefore, it is God's design that a local church,

43
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,120
that the members of that church are growing.

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,239
And we mention often about the truth

45
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,919
of 1 Peter chapter two and verse number two

46
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:01,680
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,800
that ye may what?

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
That ye may grow thereby.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,679
We find that 2 Peter chapter three and verse number 18,

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,279
that book ends, but grow in grace and knowledge

51
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,759
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

52
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,399
And we are to be growing.

53
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,360
And you can examine your own life.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,919
You can, and you should regularly

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,839
take inventory on your own life.

56
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,520
How am I doing in my Christian walk?

57
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:31,000
How am I doing growing in grace and knowledge

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,479
of my Lord and Savior?

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,039
Am I loving as I ought to love?

60
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,039
Am I serving as I ought to serve?

61
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,960
Am I having belief, faith, trust

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
in the manner in which I am?

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,160
How does my faith increase?

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,759
The Bible speaks about the church in Thessalonica

65
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,720
that their faith was increasing.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,639
And we understand this evening that my faith

67
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,720
and your faith will increase

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,360
as we have an understanding of God's word.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
So then faith cometh by hearing

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and hearing by the word of God.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,399
And we understand this evening that there are some,

72
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,360
we look at Hebrews 11 and we say, look,

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,039
they had great faith, the hall of faith chapter,

74
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,639
they believed God.

75
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,240
And we too this evening are to believe God.

76
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,559
Our focus tonight will shift,

77
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:18,240
not dealing any longer with the praise

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,880
of this church in Thyatira,

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,199
but now looking at the judgment that God pronounces

80
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,880
against this local church.

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,960
It's important that we understand

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,880
and we remember this evening that the Lord sees all things,

83
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,520
he knows all things and he judges all things.

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
It's important for us to understand this evening

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,000
that though there might be some areas of good,

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,279
though there might be some areas in which

87
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,000
as we look at Thyatira they were growing,

88
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,800
that will not lead to the just judge

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
overlooking the deficiencies.

90
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,440
It's important for us to understand that

91
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,399
because there are times in our lives

92
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,759
that we think, well, I'm doing really good over here

93
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,960
and I'm gonna ignore this section over here

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,000
or this part over here, this area of my life,

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
but the reality is that God sees all and he judges all

96
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,399
and he's not gonna give us a pass over here

97
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,000
because we're doing something good over here.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,679
And it's important that we acknowledge that

99
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,839
and recognize that this evening.

100
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
So to begin studying in verse number 20,

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,839
the Bible says this, notwithstanding,

102
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,519
I have a few things against thee.

103
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,940
Now those are words, of course,

104
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,079
that are never exciting to hear.

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,119
You like to hear I know thy works

106
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,119
and you like to hear the praise

107
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,920
and those words of commendation that are offered,

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,640
but then as Jesus says I have a few things against thee,

109
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,839
notice, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,

110
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,279
which calleth herself a prophetess to teach

111
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,679
and to seduce my servants to commit fornication

112
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:57,000
and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,839
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication

114
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,440
and she repented not.

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,760
Behold, I will cast her into a bed

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,200
and them that commit adultery with her

117
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,040
into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds.

118
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
And I will kill her children with death

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,440
and all the churches shall know

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,920
that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

121
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,640
And I will give unto every one of you

122
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,279
according to your works.

123
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,160
But unto you I say and unto the rest and Thyatira,

124
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,440
as many as have not this doctrine

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,260
and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak,

126
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,359
I will put upon you none other burden,

127
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,679
but that which you have already.

128
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,679
Hold fast till I come.

129
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:45,279
And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end,

130
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,399
to him will I give power over the nations

131
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,019
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron.

132
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,279
As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers

133
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,079
even as I received of my father.

134
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,059
And I will give him the morning star,

135
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,880
he that hath an ear,

136
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,559
let him hear what the Spirit sayeth unto the churches.

137
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,880
What a heavy message that's delivered to the church

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
in Thyatira.

139
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,440
We find that though there might be some there in Thyatira

140
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,239
that thought everything was going fine

141
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,279
and they're only focusing on the good things,

142
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,359
again, the Lord Jesus Christ examines all things.

143
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,760
And by the way, I would think

144
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,480
that it's our human tendency in nature

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,399
to focus our examination on areas

146
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,760
in which we know we're doing fairly well.

147
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,320
And we like to ignore the areas in which we may know

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,140
that we're having deficiencies.

149
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,940
But the Lord Jesus Christ writes to the church

150
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,540
and we find that this message is delivered.

151
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,019
And though there may be some

152
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,739
that have thought these things weren't going on,

153
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,260
maybe they wanted to ignore them

154
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,100
and pretend that they did not exist,

155
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,899
they are fully exposed through this letter

156
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,459
that is written to the church in Thyatira.

157
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,299
We note, number one, if you're taking notes,

158
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:01,059
the problems in Thyatira, again, the evil is exposed.

159
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,380
And what is that evil?

160
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,220
Well, we notice in verse number 20,

161
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,899
the Bible says that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,

162
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,179
which calleth herself a prophetess.

163
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,899
Notice it says to teach and to seduce my servants,

164
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,459
to commit fornication, to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

165
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,739
He'll continue in verse 22 and speak about the way

166
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,220
in which he says, I will cast her into a bed

167
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,100
and them that committed adultery with her

168
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,859
into great tribulation.

169
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:30,640
And so we find that the evil that's being exposed

170
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,140
is what we would refer to as being spiritual adultery.

171
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:37,299
We find the Bible, if you read the book of Hosea,

172
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:41,380
God gives a very clear picture and illustration

173
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,339
between Hosea and Gomer and illustrating

174
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,100
the truth of God and Israel and how Israel

175
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,100
would continually leave the God that really delivered them

176
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
and that provided everything for them

177
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
and they would chase after these little G gods, these idols.

178
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,380
And here we find that in the church in Thyatira,

179
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,140
this evil is being fully exposed.

180
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,859
It's of interest that he uses the name Jezebel.

181
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,339
And of course, if you know anything about the Old Testament,

182
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,459
your mind immediately goes back to Ahab and Jezebel.

183
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,820
And there's something about Jezebel and her reputation

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,619
that causes the people of God and even for that sake,

185
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,619
many other people that do not name their daughters Jezebel.

186
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,980
Amen?

187
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,780
I'm being serious.

188
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,059
You got Elizabeth's and you got Sarah's and you got,

189
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,020
but you don't have Jezebel's, why?

190
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Well, because it carries a thought,

191
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,380
a truth with regard to her great wickedness.

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,500
And we find that the Bible uses the same Jezebel,

193
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,419
but then also you find that it says that she's teaching

194
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,940
and look, it says to teach and to seduce my servants,

195
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,179
to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed

196
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,179
unto idols.

197
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,820
Now, this is very interesting because we go back

198
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,140
to previous letters that have been written

199
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,940
to these churches and we see the reference

200
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,059
with regard to the doctrine of Balaam.

201
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,020
And we begin to see this phraseology

202
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,700
at the end of verse number 20 of committing fornication

203
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,539
and eating things that were sacrificed unto idols.

204
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,219
This is that doctrine of Balaam

205
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:26,859
that has been previously spoken of in these churches

206
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,619
and what was going on.

207
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,500
And we go back and we think about the truth

208
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,739
of Numbers chapter 25 and all that was going on.

209
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,859
In fact, turn there just for a moment

210
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:38,380
as you hold your place here in Revelation chapter three

211
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,659
and notice in Numbers chapter 25,

212
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,700
the Bible tells us, of course,

213
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Balak had hired Balaam to come and to curse Israel

214
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,260
and he was not able to do that.

215
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,700
And there's a whole couple of chapters

216
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,859
that are given to record for us what has taken place,

217
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,580
but we find that we come to chapter 25

218
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,419
and it's.

219
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:06,339
It's the end of chapter 24 where Balaam rises up and he returns to his own place, and Balak

220
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,099
also went his way.

221
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:14,419
Now what God doesn't record for us prior to chapter 25, but records for us later in chapter

222
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:24,099
31, is the counsel that Balaam gave with regard to how to cause the children of Israel to

223
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:29,739
face this judgment and to face the judgment of God, because we find that it was Balak

224
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:36,539
that wanted Balaam to curse the people of God, and he could not curse them, but he could

225
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:43,139
give counsel on how they would corrupt themselves and thus stand in judgment.

226
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,019
Notice in chapter 25, in verse number 1, and Israel bowed and chit them, and the people

227
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,779
began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

228
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:55,179
And they called the people unto the sacrifice of their gods, and the people did eat and

229
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:01,059
bowed down to their gods, and Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor, and the anger of

230
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:05,219
the Lord was kindled against Israel.

231
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:11,779
Though Balaam could not curse the children of Israel, the reality is that God has set

232
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:18,819
in place throughout his word that obedience leads to blessing and disobedience leads to

233
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:19,819
cursing.

234
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:26,099
And we find that God will judge, and what we find is that through the counsel of Balaam,

235
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,739
that the people corrupted themselves.

236
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:35,559
They disobeyed God, and therefore God's anger was kindled against them.

237
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,939
Notice if you will, in verse number 4, the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses,

238
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:44,059
Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that

239
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:48,859
the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.

240
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,019
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined

241
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,019
unto Baal-peor.

242
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,179
And behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish

243
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,259
woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of

244
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,499
Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

245
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:12,659
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw it, he rose

246
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,099
up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand, and he went after the

247
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:22,259
man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the

248
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,899
woman through her belly.

249
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,499
So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

250
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:34,979
But then notice verse 9, and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

251
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:39,659
That's serious judgment, twenty-four thousand.

252
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,739
We find that here as we look in Revelation chapter number 2 and begin to think about

253
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:50,979
the church in Thyatira and the evil being exposed, we find that here in verse 20 and

254
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,059
21 and 22, he's exposing this evil.

255
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:00,359
He does mention to us as we read in verse 21, and I gave her space to repent of her

256
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,859
fornication and she repented not.

257
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:06,819
I'm thankful that our God is gracious and he's long-suffering.

258
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:12,739
We find that the judgment did not come immediately upon the church in Thyatira, but the reality

259
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:19,899
was that judgment was certain, and judgment would be severe if they refused the counsel

260
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,619
of the Lord, if they refused to deal with this evil, if they continued to allow these

261
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,339
things to be present in the local church.

262
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,619
We find that God's judgment would come, it was certain, and God's judgment would be severe.

263
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:42,059
You know, there are many people today, I feel, as not only a church, but I think of individuals,

264
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,939
and I want to focus just for a moment more on the individual.

265
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:49,539
There are many people today, individuals, people that claim to be saved by the grace

266
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:57,199
of God, that live lives of sin and wickedness, and they live hiding and covering, and they

267
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,599
think that they're getting away with something because God is gracious and long-suffering.

268
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,999
Can I tell you this evening that the way of the transgressor is hard?

269
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:13,999
Can I tell you this evening that the Bible says, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

270
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:19,999
And if you're living and you're behaving in a manner which is not appropriate for God's

271
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:24,479
people, He says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

272
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,999
He says, be holy for I am holy.

273
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,959
And we understand this evening that God is gracious and He's long-suffering, and I'm

274
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,999
so grateful for that truth.

275
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:39,959
But if there's no chastening in our lives, we have to ask ourselves why.

276
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,959
Because the Bible says, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

277
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,759
Do you know that chastisement is a birthmark of being a Christian?

278
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,759
It's what it is.

279
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,759
It's a birthmark of being a Christian.

280
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,759
Do you know why?

281
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,599
He doesn't chasten those that are not His.

282
00:14:54,599 --> 00:15:00,319
You say, well, how can that lost person live like that?

283
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,959
Because they don't belong to God.

284
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,519
And He chastens His own.

285
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,679
And here, the Bible says, I gave her space to repent.

286
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,799
And the reality is that God is so gracious and He's so long-suffering.

287
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,039
And how does God deliver to us opportunities to repent?

288
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,679
He uses His Word.

289
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,999
He uses the preaching of His Word, the teaching of His Word.

290
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,719
There's devotionals that you can have.

291
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,639
There's personal Bible reading.

292
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,599
And God will graciously, through His Holy Spirit, convict us.

293
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,479
And I say to you this evening that conviction is a good thing.

294
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:43,339
It is a good thing when the Holy Spirit of God convicts us of sin in our lives.

295
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,599
Sometimes we don't respond to that conviction because we don't want someone else to think

296
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,599
we're a sinner.

297
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:51,399
And the reality is that we all know that we're all sinners.

298
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,879
Amen?

299
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,219
We all know that we're all sinners.

300
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,359
We know the truth of God's Word.

301
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,799
If we say that we have no sin, His truth's not in us.

302
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,479
We make Him a liar, 1 John 1.

303
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:08,239
And so we find this evening that God is so gracious and He's so long-suffering, but the

304
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:13,079
Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to convict.

305
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,039
And I'm not sure exactly in every person's life, every individual's life, how the Holy

306
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,119
Spirit works specifically, but I know that He works.

307
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:30,399
And I know this truth of God's Word as well, that the believer has the ability to quench

308
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,759
and to grieve the Holy Spirit.

309
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,039
We find that the Holy Spirit of God, one of His ministries with regard to lost people,

310
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,279
according to John 16, one of the ministries is that He would reprove the world of sin

311
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,839
and of righteousness and of judgment to come.

312
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,519
I think about those that the Apostle Paul stood before and preached the gospel, and

313
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,079
they were under great conviction.

314
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,639
And they were so under conviction that they said, Paul, you're mad.

315
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,959
You're beside yourself.

316
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:02,959
Get out.

317
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,919
I'm not going to listen to you any longer.

318
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,679
Almost, Agrippa said, thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

319
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,959
They were under conviction, but they resisted the conviction.

320
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,119
And as a child of God, we can grieve and quench the Holy Spirit.

321
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:26,439
And it's a dangerous thing to grieve and to quench the Holy Spirit.

322
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:32,359
Oh, when the Holy Spirit of God takes the Word of God and convicts us of sin in our

323
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,759
lives, oh, how we ought to respond.

324
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,479
He says, I gave her space to repent.

325
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:45,999
But obviously, though at this time, in the time of the writing, there was no repentance,

326
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:51,239
and therefore the judgment is given, and it's explained to us, again, the severity

327
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,359
of the judgment.

328
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:59,559
We read already in Numbers 25, and we referenced historically the severity of that judgment.

329
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,279
But notice here, the Bible says, behold, verse 22, I will cast her into a bed, and them that

330
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:13,439
commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

331
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,599
So again, there's still this offer of repenting.

332
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,179
You know, throughout the Old Testament, especially the minor prophets, you'll read regularly

333
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:28,519
where the Bible says that God says, return, return, return, turn to me.

334
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,279
God is pleading with His people.

335
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,139
God is so longsuffering to His people.

336
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:38,200
Think about the nation of Israel, and think about Judah and all of their wickedness and

337
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,959
all of their idolatry.

338
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:47,919
We find that God continuously raised up the prophets to come and to deliver a message,

339
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,839
and that message was, think about Isaiah 1, come and let us reason together.

340
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,200
Though your sins be as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.

341
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,279
God is calling these people within the church here that they've allowed this false teacher,

342
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,119
this one that called herself a prophetess, and those that have been caught up with this

343
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,339
false teaching, He says they need to repent.

344
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:18,039
Notice in verse 23, and I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know

345
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,919
that I and He would search at the reins and hearts.

346
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,279
Now notice when He says I will kill her children with death, He's referring here not to children

347
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,079
as little kids, He's referring to those that have been influenced and instructed by the

348
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,599
way of this false teaching.

349
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,639
In other words, we would call them the followers of this way.

350
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:47,399
And God says they're going to be judged, judgment's going to come.

351
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:50,599
Our God is a just judge.

352
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,719
He doeth all things well and all things right.

353
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:59,079
But we must understand this evening that as gracious and loving and merciful as He is,

354
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,119
that He's still just.

355
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,839
And He's perfect in harmony with all of those attributes.

356
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,919
And we find that this judgment, the severity of it is clearly given to us here in the text

357
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,919
of Scripture.

358
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,439
Can I tell you this evening, I have no desire to stand under the judgment of God.

359
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:26,239
I mean honestly, when we know the judgment hand of God, the chastening hand of God, I

360
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,719
pray regularly, God, help me to respond to the conviction so that it doesn't have to

361
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,339
go beyond that.

362
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:38,319
Because if I don't respond to the conviction, then the chastening will come.

363
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,399
And I don't want to deal with chastening.

364
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,159
I know that it's because God loves me and I know that it's for my good.

365
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,479
But oh, how we would learn to respond to the conviction, that we'd listen for the voice

366
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:57,559
of God and that we would take and follow the precepts that God has given to us so

367
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,399
that we might please Him, honor Him, and glorify Him.

368
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:08,659
The reality is that the judgment in Thyatira should have had an impact not only upon those

369
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:13,999
that would receive the message in Thyatira, but upon all churches, the other churches

370
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:18,319
here in the book of Revelation, but even the churches throughout the church age.

371
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,119
Notice the Bible says in verse number 23,

372
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:27,359
And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know, shall know what?

373
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,479
That I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

374
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,319
And I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

375
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:42,319
You know, the Bible says in Jeremiah 17 and verse number 9 that the heart is just deceitful

376
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,919
and it's desperately wicked.

377
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,239
Who can know it?

378
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:48,479
And verse number 10 says, I the Lord try the hearts.

379
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,799
He knows.

380
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,759
And here the Lord Jesus Christ says, I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

381
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,079
And he knows.

382
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,199
He knows.

383
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:06,439
We find this evening that this message of judgment with regard to the problems in Thyatira

384
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:13,000
should have had an impact on others, should have an impact on us tonight.

385
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,959
Because God is serious about holiness.

386
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,519
God is serious about holiness.

387
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,519
I want you to notice over in the book of Proverbs in chapter 19, you don't need to turn there.

388
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,239
I'm going to have you look at a passage in the book of Acts.

389
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,039
But in Proverbs 19, you might want to jot it down.

390
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,159
Proverbs 19 and verse 25, the Bible says this,

391
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,000
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware.

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,319
And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

393
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,119
I think about the first part of that verse, smite a scorner, and the simple will beware.

394
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,000
You ever watch somebody else get punished for something, and you're like, I take note.

395
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,319
I see someone face some consequence for an action, and I realize that that action results

396
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,440
in that consequence, and I don't want the consequence, so I learn through what they

397
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
experienced.

398
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,039
I actually preached a series of messages about learning lessons that God would teach us

399
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,000
on a Wednesday evening series a few years ago.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,399
And I mentioned that we can learn from our own failures.

401
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,879
David did.

402
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:23,159
David learned from his own mistakes.

403
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,839
He tried to move the ark, and he didn't follow the way that God said to have it done.

404
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:33,039
And he went back and he found out how it was to be done, and he did it the right way.

405
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,599
He learned from his mistakes.

406
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,679
And then I preached a follow-up message of that on a Wednesday evening.

407
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,959
Not only can we learn from our own mistakes, but we can learn from the mistakes of others.

408
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,039
You know, there's some people that make the same mistake multiple times because they're

409
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,720
slow learners, and there are others that learn from the mistakes of others because they don't

410
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,559
want to have to experience themselves.

411
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,539
Notice Acts chapter 5.

412
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:04,440
Even as we're turning there, many of you would be familiar with the account that begins in

413
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,679
Acts chapter 5 with Ananias and Sapphira.

414
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,239
We read this account, and we are familiar with it, and we find that the Bible says in

415
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:20,919
verse number 1 of Acts 5, but a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold

416
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,160
a possession and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought

417
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,479
a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

418
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:34,760
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to

419
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,279
keep back part of the price of the land?

420
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,079
Whilst it remained, was it not thine own?

421
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,880
And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?

422
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,399
Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

423
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,119
Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

424
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,320
And Ananias, hearing these words, notice verse 5, fell down and gave up the ghost.

425
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,559
Do you know what that means?

426
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,199
It means he died.

427
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:05,639
And great fear came on all them that heard these things.

428
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:11,639
You know, I read the end of verse number 5, and I say, rightly so.

429
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:17,359
If you heard what took place, if you heard about what had just happened in Ananias, you

430
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,720
too would have great fear.

431
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Verse number 6, the Bible says, and the young man arose and wound him up and carried him

432
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
out and buried him.

433
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,479
It was about the space of three hours after when his wife, not knowing what was done,

434
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,479
came in.

435
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,600
And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?

436
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,079
And she said, Yea, for so much.

437
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,000
And Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of

438
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the Lord?

439
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,320
Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry

440
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
thee out.

441
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,479
Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.

442
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:56,479
And the young man came in, and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her

443
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:57,479
by her husband.

444
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:02,440
I read the ten verses so that I could read verse 11.

445
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Verse 11 says, And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these

446
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,239
things.

447
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,579
Why was there great fear?

448
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,119
Because they saw the severe judgment.

449
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,040
They saw the importance of holiness, that God was serious.

450
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,880
Peter said to Ananias, I mean, the reality is that he didn't have to sell the possession,

451
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,600
and after selling it, he didn't have to give all the proceeds from the sale.

452
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
But what happened is he lied.

453
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,279
He lied.

454
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,959
I mentioned last week, as we took the Lord's Supper, that it's so sad in our society today

455
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:49,799
how commonplace it has become for people to lie.

456
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,760
Little, little regard for truth.

457
00:26:52,760 --> 00:27:00,399
So much so that in national polls over the last several decade or so, that nearing 50%

458
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:05,479
of the American population just expect that people are lying to them and are okay with

459
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,479
it.

460
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:12,479
That just doesn't make sense to me.

461
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:18,359
We mentioned that because of looking at that put on and put off truth that God gives us

462
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,959
in Ephesians chapter number 4, put off the old, put on the new.

463
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:31,399
One of the things he says, we're to speak the truth with every man.

464
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,600
And we notice in Acts chapter number 5, and we get to verse number 11, after reading all

465
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,239
that took place, that that great fear came upon the church.

466
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:44,040
Our God is a consuming fire.

467
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
He is.

468
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,279
He's a consuming fire.

469
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,079
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

470
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,919
It's what the Bible tells us.

471
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,619
And I understand that we live in an era today, and it's so much more comfortable and encouraging

472
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:04,239
to talk about the grace of God and the love of God, and I'm thankful for all of those

473
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:12,199
attributes, but we cannot, we cannot, we must not fail to acknowledge that our God

474
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:18,720
is a just judge, and He is a consuming fire.

475
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,199
You think about that great message that was preached in yesteryear about those that really

476
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:31,059
kind of was so instrumental in the great awakening, and the message, sinners in the hands of an

477
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,799
angry God.

478
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,919
It's my understanding, and many of you have read the accounts as well, that the message

479
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,760
was just simply read in a monotone type of a voice.

480
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,580
But he had been and he'd spent so much time with God leading up to that message.

481
00:28:50,580 --> 00:29:00,279
He was so overwhelmed with the truth of the holiness of God, and it had such a profound

482
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,039
impact.

483
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,760
I'm thankful that God is love, He is.

484
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,179
Thankful that He's merciful, He is rich in mercy.

485
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,020
Thankful that He's gracious.

486
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,279
But we must not forget tonight that He's the judge.

487
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:24,080
And He says to the church in Thyatira, you're doing some good things, there's some growth.

488
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,339
Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, and He announces judgment.

489
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,359
What's the prescription number two?

490
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,119
What's the prescription for Thyatira?

491
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,679
What are they to do?

492
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:41,559
As we read verses 24 and 25, it seems that there was a portion of people within the church

493
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,640
there who had not compromised.

494
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,919
And it seems quite obvious as you read verses 24 and 25 that the Lord Jesus Christ begins

495
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,239
to talk specifically to this group of people, and He gives instruction.

496
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:00,119
We find in verse 24, He says, but unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira.

497
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:06,399
If many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they

498
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,999
speak, I will put upon you none other burden.

499
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:18,219
But that which you have already, notice what he says, hold fast till I come.

500
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:23,599
Just notice just those two words, hold fast in verse 25.

501
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,999
And really it carries with it the idea of remaining faithful.

502
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:31,559
It carries with it the idea of continuing.

503
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,559
And the reality is that what God is saying to these that have not known the depths of

504
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,839
Satan and they've not been wrapped up in this doctrine, he says, listen, you need to continue

505
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:48,319
and you need to be careful that you do not allow the wickedness to impact you.

506
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,039
Notice in verse 26, he says, and he that overcometh, and then notice this phrase, and keepeth my

507
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,079
works unto the end.

508
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,639
Listen, there's some things that God has instructed us to do.

509
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,759
There's some things that we're to be engaged in.

510
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,239
And he says, hold fast and keep my works.

511
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:10,479
And this is the prescription for this segment, if you will, of the church and how important

512
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:15,559
it is that we acknowledge this evening the importance of holding fast.

513
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,079
Listen, compromise is all around us.

514
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:28,199
It seems as if every week there's temptation after temptation for you as an individual

515
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:36,159
and for our church collectively and corporately to go down the path of some level of compromise.

516
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,799
And we have to just determine, am I going to please God or man?

517
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,359
What am I going to do?

518
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,519
Am I going to please God, please man?

519
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,119
We find that God gives, number three, the promise for Thyatira.

520
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,039
I want you to notice three things that God reminds them of.

521
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,959
In verse 25, the verse ends with that phrase, till I come.

522
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:06,559
What a great promise that we have, a reminder of Christ's return.

523
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,080
When we observed the Lord's Supper last week, we mentioned that the Bible says that as often

524
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,039
as you do this, you do it in remembrance of me.

525
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,419
And we find that it talks about that we do show his death till he come.

526
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:24,199
And now we find the Lord Jesus Christ is saying to these there in Thyatira, but that which

527
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,879
you have already, hold fast till I come.

528
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:31,720
Listen, the reality this evening is that Jesus is coming.

529
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,559
I don't know when, you don't know when, but we can rest assured that he's coming.

530
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,919
And we can also rest assured that he's going to be right on time.

531
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,279
It may not be your timetable.

532
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,119
It may not be my timetable, but it will be God's perfect time.

533
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,299
We find this evening that for us and for the church in Thyatira, the reality is that we

534
00:32:53,299 --> 00:33:00,360
must keep our eyes on the truth that our Savior is coming and that we must be found when he

535
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:08,399
returns faithful in doing what he's called us to do, not being ashamed of him it is appearing.

536
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,599
I mean, as individuals or even corporately as a church, that we would not be ashamed

537
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,619
of him at his appearing.

538
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,599
Why are you doing the things that you're doing?

539
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,979
I was questioned last week about a particular idea and thought, and I said, listen, one

540
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:27,879
of the realities is that as a church, a church has a responsibility, and as I look at our

541
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:32,080
church, a responsibility that we have with any ministry that we might seek to be in,

542
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,199
in just seeking to endeavor in a particular area, that we have to, how does this fit into

543
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,199
the mission of the church?

544
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,039
How does this bring glory to God?

545
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,399
How does this edify the believer?

546
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,039
How does this evangelize the lost?

547
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:53,360
How does this fit into the purpose of the church?

548
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,639
Because the church is not a club.

549
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,279
The church is a living organism.

550
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:06,399
It's the bride of Christ, and we have a purpose, and everything that we do must fit in somehow

551
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,479
to the fulfillment of that purpose that God has given to us.

552
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:16,639
We find that he reminds them, till I come.

553
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,679
Can I encourage you this evening to allow those words to resonate in your heart and

554
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,040
your mind, till I come.

555
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,160
Jesus is coming.

556
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,799
Jesus is coming.

557
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,799
Will he find us faithful?

558
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:33,160
Will he find us faithful?

559
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:39,799
Notice he says in verse 26, and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him

560
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:44,760
will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the

561
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,160
vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.

562
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,320
And I will give him the morning star, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit

563
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,119
sayeth unto the churches.

564
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,919
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ mentions about his coming, but then we find also that

565
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,799
he mentions about his millennial reign.

566
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:07,119
We understand that really as we come to the fourth chapter of the book of Revelation,

567
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,600
I believe it's a picture, we'll deal with it in great detail as we get to that chapter

568
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,679
as we're studying through this book, it's a great picture, the rapture of the church.

569
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,040
I believe that God's word is very clear, that the rapture of the church will take place

570
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,000
followed by seven years of tribulation, and then at the end of that seven years of tribulation

571
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,880
there's the battle of Armageddon, and then there is the millennial reign of Christ.

572
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,239
The literal millennial reign of Christ, when the Lord Jesus Christ will rule and reign

573
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,000
on earth for a thousand years.

574
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,079
And he says, and the encouragement, the promise to these that would keep, hold fast, and keep

575
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,040
his words, works, the reality is that we will rule and reign with him, we'll rule and reign

576
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
with him.

577
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,839
He speaks of position and he speaks of rulership, and what privilege and responsibility is ours

578
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,139
that we can rule and reign with the Lord Jesus Christ.

579
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:07,679
Notice if you will, skip over to Revelation chapter 20 as we look here at this portion

580
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,639
of scripture that records for us this part of the millennial reign of Christ, and Satan

581
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,760
is bound for a thousand years.

582
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,559
At the end of the thousand years he'll be loosed for a little season according to the

583
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:26,639
scriptures, and then thereafter he will be smitten and he'll be cast in a lake of fire

584
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,760
where he'll suffer forever and ever.

585
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,079
It says that he'll be tormented day and night forever and ever.

586
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,639
But I want you to notice in Revelation chapter 20, and notice in verse number four, the Bible

587
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,040
says, and I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them.

588
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,820
And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word

589
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,519
of God and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his

590
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,459
mark upon their foreheads or in their hands.

591
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:58,500
And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years, but the rest of the dead live

592
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,940
not again until the thousand years were finished.

593
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,339
This is the first resurrection.

594
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:07,100
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.

595
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:13,019
On such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ

596
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:19,500
and shall reign with him a thousand years.

597
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,500
But the reality is that as the letter to the church in Thyatira ends, it's interesting

598
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:33,940
how that the letter ends with pointing the people to having an eternal perspective.

599
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,579
You know what the danger is for us is to have a temporal perspective.

600
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:46,299
It's a danger for the church in Thyatira, it's a danger for us to think temporally,

601
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:52,100
to think just about right now and well, if we want to grow, we have to do this.

602
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,540
There are all kinds of church growth seminars and various things that take place and they

603
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,899
say, oh, you got to do this and you got to change this and one of the things that they'll

604
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:04,940
say is get rid of this Bible and use a different Bible and get rid of this pulpit and use a

605
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,000
different kind of pulpit and get rid of this piano and get some drums up here.

606
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,660
That's what they'll tell you.

607
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,979
And there's a danger in thinking temporally that that's what's needed.

608
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:24,380
But can I tell you that there are churches just like our church that are standing for

609
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:30,380
truth, that are preaching the truth of God's Word, that are using the right Bible, singing

610
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,419
the right music, having the right standards and they're growing, why?

611
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,419
Because they're doing God's work God's way.

612
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,419
And God's work must be done God's way.

613
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:43,940
Listen, the gospel still works.

614
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,700
The gospel still works.

615
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,739
Jesus still saves.

616
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:48,739
Do you believe that tonight?

617
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,820
I believe that.

618
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,979
The gospel still works.

619
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:53,339
Jesus still saves.

620
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:59,359
We have just the opportunity to rejoice and to know that the Lord as He closes out this

621
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,539
letter is helping these individuals, this church, to have an eternal perspective.

622
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:15,859
This evening is absolutely imperative for us to see beyond this day and to see the blessings

623
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:24,299
that are in store for eternity because we've pleased our Lord.

624
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:31,500
I don't want to find myself, I don't want you to find yourself in a position where you've

625
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,299
displeased the Lord.

626
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,779
The Bible says with many of them, God was not well pleased.

627
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:41,580
Paul says this in the book of Colossians and I'll finish with this tonight.

628
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,580
The book of Colossians in chapter number 1, Paul says of a group of people that he's never

629
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:53,539
met personally but he's seeking to minister to and he has a heart for them and he says

630
00:39:53,539 --> 00:40:00,099
to them in Colossians 1 and verse 28, as he kind of outlines and summarizes his...

631
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:08,219
ministry. He says, whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

632
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:15,019
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. See, one day we're going to stand before

633
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:21,219
Christ. We're going to stand before Christ one day. If you're saved tonight, you'll stand

634
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:28,539
at the bima, the judgment seat of Christ. The second death has no power over us. The

635
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:33,379
great white throne judgment is not for me. The great white throne judgment is for lost people.

636
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:40,059
If you're saved tonight, it's the bima, the judgment seat of Christ. And here Paul says

637
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,059
that we're doing this, we're actively engaged in this, why? That we may present every man

638
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:53,499
perfect in Christ Jesus, knowing that every believer will stand before Christ and having

639
00:40:53,499 --> 00:41:00,539
that eternal perspective, not just focusing on the temporal. The church in Thyatira is

640
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,659
corrected. God knew all that was going on. Oh, they had a lot of activity, they had a

641
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:13,739
lot of things. God mentions and He praises them for the areas of growth. He says, notwithstanding,

642
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:21,419
there's some problems. And I'm giving you counsel on what needs to be done and I'm letting

643
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:30,139
you know that judgment will come for those that would hold fast, the great promises.

644
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:36,139
Just keep on keeping on. Keep your eyes on Jesus because He's coming. And you'll rule

645
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:42,939
and reign with Him for a thousand years. It's a wonderful truth of God's Word. This evening,

646
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:49,699
I don't know if the Holy Spirit may have touched some part of your life and convicted you of

647
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:55,339
something, but if so, I would encourage you, respond. Don't be like the ones there in Thyatira

648
00:41:55,339 --> 00:42:01,699
that God says, I gave them space to repent. But judgment was going to come because they

649
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:07,099
did not repent. How many times we find in the Old Testament, how many times we find

650
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:11,219
even in the New Testament, the book of Revelation, we'll get there in a few chapters, how they

651
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:20,019
would not repent. They would not. Hardened hearts. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing

652
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:24,859
and I'm thinking I'm getting away with it. You're never going to get away with it. God

653
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:30,099
sees all and He judges all. The church in Thyatira, let's pray. Father, we love You.

654
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:35,219
We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word and the truth contained therein.

655
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:46,259
God, I pray that You would help us tonight. He that hath ears, let him hear. God, I pray

656
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:56,299
that as the churches that are represented there would learn, be impacted by this message,

657
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:03,859
You would help us tonight by way of Bible preservation to be impacted and influenced

658
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:10,819
by the message to the church in Thyatira. God, help us to have an eternal perspective.

659
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:16,099
Help us, Lord, to hold fast and to continue in Your works. Lord, help us to seek to please

660
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:21,679
You and honor You through all that we say and do. Help us to search our own hearts knowing

661
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:29,059
that You search the hearts. Help us, Lord, to be clean and to be pure and to be holy.

662
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:32,699
Help us to be right with You and we'll thank You for it. Would you stand with me? Heads

663
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:34,099
are bowed, eyes are closed.
