00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
chapter number two this evening, Revelation chapter two,

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.679
and we're looking at verses 20 through 29.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.159
It's really part two.

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.779
Last Sunday evening, we had the Lord's Supper,

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.640
and so I preached from 1 Corinthians chapter number 11.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.279
And so you gotta go a couple of weeks back

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.680
in your memory bank in order to remember the first part

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.459
of the church in Thyatira.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:23.739
And that message was preached a couple of weeks ago.

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.879
And in that study, we examined, if you will,

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.819
the praise for the church in Thyatira.

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.579
We mentioned some things about the church,

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.020
but then we got to verse number 19, excuse me,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.659
and the Bible says, I know thy works.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.599
And we've mentioned that each of these churches

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:40.900
that are addressed in the book of Revelation,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.700
they're literal churches, they're local churches

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.060
that are existing at the time of the writing.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.740
And to each of them, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.099
the head of the church, the one who is to have preeminence,

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:54.900
says, I know thy works.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.520
And we said this about the church in Thyatira,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.720
that as the Lord commends this church

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.959
and offers praise with regard to their works,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.879
you find in verse number 19 that it ends by saying,

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.599
and the last to be more than the first.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.639
And we made note that the church was a church

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.239
that was growing, and a church ought to be growing.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.519
And we mentioned five particular areas

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.519
that are referenced in verse 19 of Revelation 2

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.160
in which this church was growing.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.040
They were growing in their works.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.080
They were growing in charity.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.760
They were growing in service.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.199
They were growing in faith.

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:30.480
And they were growing in patience.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.360
And we looked at each of those areas specifically,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480
and we were rejoicing in the fact

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.000
that a church was growing.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It is God's design for individual believers to grow.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.559
A church is made up of individual believers,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:50.279
and therefore, it is God's design that a local church,

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.120
that the members of that church are growing.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.239
And we mention often about the truth

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.919
of 1 Peter chapter two and verse number two

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.680
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.800
that ye may what?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.400
That ye may grow thereby.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.679
We find that 2 Peter chapter three and verse number 18,

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.279
that book ends, but grow in grace and knowledge

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.759
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.399
And we are to be growing.

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.360
And you can examine your own life.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.919
You can, and you should regularly

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.839
take inventory on your own life.

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.520
How am I doing in my Christian walk?

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:31.000
How am I doing growing in grace and knowledge

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.479
of my Lord and Savior?

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.039
Am I loving as I ought to love?

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.039
Am I serving as I ought to serve?

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.960
Am I having belief, faith, trust

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.320
in the manner in which I am?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.160
How does my faith increase?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.759
The Bible speaks about the church in Thessalonica

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.720
that their faith was increasing.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.639
And we understand this evening that my faith

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.720
and your faith will increase

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.360
as we have an understanding of God's word.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.000
So then faith cometh by hearing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and hearing by the word of God.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.399
And we understand this evening that there are some,

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.360
we look at Hebrews 11 and we say, look,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.039
they had great faith, the hall of faith chapter,

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.639
they believed God.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.240
And we too this evening are to believe God.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.559
Our focus tonight will shift,

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.240
not dealing any longer with the praise

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.880
of this church in Thyatira,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.199
but now looking at the judgment that God pronounces

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.880
against this local church.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.960
It's important that we understand

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.880
and we remember this evening that the Lord sees all things,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.520
he knows all things and he judges all things.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.240
It's important for us to understand this evening

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.000
that though there might be some areas of good,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.279
though there might be some areas in which

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.000
as we look at Thyatira they were growing,

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.800
that will not lead to the just judge

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
overlooking the deficiencies.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.440
It's important for us to understand that

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.399
because there are times in our lives

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.759
that we think, well, I'm doing really good over here

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.960
and I'm gonna ignore this section over here

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.000
or this part over here, this area of my life,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.080
but the reality is that God sees all and he judges all

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.399
and he's not gonna give us a pass over here

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.000
because we're doing something good over here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.679
And it's important that we acknowledge that

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.839
and recognize that this evening.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.600
So to begin studying in verse number 20,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.839
the Bible says this, notwithstanding,

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:26.519
I have a few things against thee.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.940
Now those are words, of course,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.079
that are never exciting to hear.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.119
You like to hear I know thy works

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.119
and you like to hear the praise

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.920
and those words of commendation that are offered,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.640
but then as Jesus says I have a few things against thee,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.839
notice, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.279
which calleth herself a prophetess to teach

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.679
and to seduce my servants to commit fornication

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:57.000
and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.839
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.440
and she repented not.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.760
Behold, I will cast her into a bed

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.200
and them that commit adultery with her

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.040
into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040
And I will kill her children with death

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.440
and all the churches shall know

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.920
that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.640
And I will give unto every one of you

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.279
according to your works.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:29.160
But unto you I say and unto the rest and Thyatira,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.440
as many as have not this doctrine

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.260
and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.359
I will put upon you none other burden,

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:39.679
but that which you have already.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.679
Hold fast till I come.

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:45.279
And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.399
to him will I give power over the nations

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.019
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron.

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:54.279
As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.079
even as I received of my father.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.059
And I will give him the morning star,

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.880
he that hath an ear,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.559
let him hear what the Spirit sayeth unto the churches.

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.880
What a heavy message that's delivered to the church

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.200
in Thyatira.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.440
We find that though there might be some there in Thyatira

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.239
that thought everything was going fine

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.279
and they're only focusing on the good things,

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.359
again, the Lord Jesus Christ examines all things.

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:23.760
And by the way, I would think

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.480
that it's our human tendency in nature

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.399
to focus our examination on areas

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.760
in which we know we're doing fairly well.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.320
And we like to ignore the areas in which we may know

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.140
that we're having deficiencies.

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:39.940
But the Lord Jesus Christ writes to the church

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.540
and we find that this message is delivered.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.019
And though there may be some

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:46.739
that have thought these things weren't going on,

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.260
maybe they wanted to ignore them

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.100
and pretend that they did not exist,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.899
they are fully exposed through this letter

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.459
that is written to the church in Thyatira.

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.299
We note, number one, if you're taking notes,

00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:01.059
the problems in Thyatira, again, the evil is exposed.

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.380
And what is that evil?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.220
Well, we notice in verse number 20,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.899
the Bible says that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.179
which calleth herself a prophetess.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.899
Notice it says to teach and to seduce my servants,

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:17.459
to commit fornication, to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.739
He'll continue in verse 22 and speak about the way

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.220
in which he says, I will cast her into a bed

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.100
and them that committed adultery with her

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.859
into great tribulation.

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:30.640
And so we find that the evil that's being exposed

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.140
is what we would refer to as being spiritual adultery.

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:37.299
We find the Bible, if you read the book of Hosea,

00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:41.380
God gives a very clear picture and illustration

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.339
between Hosea and Gomer and illustrating

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:48.100
the truth of God and Israel and how Israel

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.100
would continually leave the God that really delivered them

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.500
and that provided everything for them

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.500
and they would chase after these little G gods, these idols.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.380
And here we find that in the church in Thyatira,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.140
this evil is being fully exposed.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.859
It's of interest that he uses the name Jezebel.

00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.339
And of course, if you know anything about the Old Testament,

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:17.459
your mind immediately goes back to Ahab and Jezebel.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:21.820
And there's something about Jezebel and her reputation

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.619
that causes the people of God and even for that sake,

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:29.619
many other people that do not name their daughters Jezebel.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.980
Amen?

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.780
I'm being serious.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.059
You got Elizabeth's and you got Sarah's and you got,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.020
but you don't have Jezebel's, why?

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.020
Well, because it carries a thought,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.380
a truth with regard to her great wickedness.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.500
And we find that the Bible uses the same Jezebel,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.419
but then also you find that it says that she's teaching

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:56.940
and look, it says to teach and to seduce my servants,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.179
to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.179
unto idols.

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.820
Now, this is very interesting because we go back

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.140
to previous letters that have been written

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.940
to these churches and we see the reference

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.059
with regard to the doctrine of Balaam.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:16.020
And we begin to see this phraseology

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.700
at the end of verse number 20 of committing fornication

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.539
and eating things that were sacrificed unto idols.

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:23.219
This is that doctrine of Balaam

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:26.859
that has been previously spoken of in these churches

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.619
and what was going on.

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:30.500
And we go back and we think about the truth

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.739
of Numbers chapter 25 and all that was going on.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.859
In fact, turn there just for a moment

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:38.380
as you hold your place here in Revelation chapter three

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.659
and notice in Numbers chapter 25,

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:43.700
the Bible tells us, of course,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.700
Balak had hired Balaam to come and to curse Israel

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.260
and he was not able to do that.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.700
And there's a whole couple of chapters

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:56.859
that are given to record for us what has taken place,

00:09:56.859 --> 00:09:59.580
but we find that we come to chapter 25

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.419
and it's.

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:06.339
It's the end of chapter 24 where Balaam rises up and he returns to his own place, and Balak

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.099
also went his way.

00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:14.419
Now what God doesn't record for us prior to chapter 25, but records for us later in chapter

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:24.099
31, is the counsel that Balaam gave with regard to how to cause the children of Israel to

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:29.739
face this judgment and to face the judgment of God, because we find that it was Balak

00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:36.539
that wanted Balaam to curse the people of God, and he could not curse them, but he could

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:43.139
give counsel on how they would corrupt themselves and thus stand in judgment.

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:47.019
Notice in chapter 25, in verse number 1, and Israel bowed and chit them, and the people

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:50.779
began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:55.179
And they called the people unto the sacrifice of their gods, and the people did eat and

00:10:55.179 --> 00:11:01.059
bowed down to their gods, and Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor, and the anger of

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:05.219
the Lord was kindled against Israel.

00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:11.779
Though Balaam could not curse the children of Israel, the reality is that God has set

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:18.819
in place throughout his word that obedience leads to blessing and disobedience leads to

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:19.819
cursing.

00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:26.099
And we find that God will judge, and what we find is that through the counsel of Balaam,

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:28.739
that the people corrupted themselves.

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:35.559
They disobeyed God, and therefore God's anger was kindled against them.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:39.939
Notice if you will, in verse number 4, the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses,

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:44.059
Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:48.859
the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:54.019
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:55.019
unto Baal-peor.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:12:00.179
And behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:04.259
woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:08.499
Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:12.659
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw it, he rose

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:17.099
up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand, and he went after the

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:22.259
man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:23.899
woman through her belly.

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:26.499
So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:34.979
But then notice verse 9, and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:39.659
That's serious judgment, twenty-four thousand.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:44.739
We find that here as we look in Revelation chapter number 2 and begin to think about

00:12:44.739 --> 00:12:50.979
the church in Thyatira and the evil being exposed, we find that here in verse 20 and

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:55.059
21 and 22, he's exposing this evil.

00:12:55.059 --> 00:13:00.359
He does mention to us as we read in verse 21, and I gave her space to repent of her

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.859
fornication and she repented not.

00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:06.819
I'm thankful that our God is gracious and he's long-suffering.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:12.739
We find that the judgment did not come immediately upon the church in Thyatira, but the reality

00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:19.899
was that judgment was certain, and judgment would be severe if they refused the counsel

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:25.619
of the Lord, if they refused to deal with this evil, if they continued to allow these

00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:29.339
things to be present in the local church.

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:35.619
We find that God's judgment would come, it was certain, and God's judgment would be severe.

00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:42.059
You know, there are many people today, I feel, as not only a church, but I think of individuals,

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.939
and I want to focus just for a moment more on the individual.

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:49.539
There are many people today, individuals, people that claim to be saved by the grace

00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:57.199
of God, that live lives of sin and wickedness, and they live hiding and covering, and they

00:13:57.199 --> 00:14:03.599
think that they're getting away with something because God is gracious and long-suffering.

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:07.999
Can I tell you this evening that the way of the transgressor is hard?

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:13.999
Can I tell you this evening that the Bible says, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:19.999
And if you're living and you're behaving in a manner which is not appropriate for God's

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:24.479
people, He says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:26.999
He says, be holy for I am holy.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:30.959
And we understand this evening that God is gracious and He's long-suffering, and I'm

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.999
so grateful for that truth.

00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:39.959
But if there's no chastening in our lives, we have to ask ourselves why.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.959
Because the Bible says, whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:48.759
Do you know that chastisement is a birthmark of being a Christian?

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.759
It's what it is.

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.759
It's a birthmark of being a Christian.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:51.759
Do you know why?

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.599
He doesn't chasten those that are not His.

00:14:54.599 --> 00:15:00.319
You say, well, how can that lost person live like that?

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:02.959
Because they don't belong to God.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:05.519
And He chastens His own.

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:09.679
And here, the Bible says, I gave her space to repent.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:13.799
And the reality is that God is so gracious and He's so long-suffering.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:18.039
And how does God deliver to us opportunities to repent?

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:19.679
He uses His Word.

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.999
He uses the preaching of His Word, the teaching of His Word.

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:24.719
There's devotionals that you can have.

00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:26.639
There's personal Bible reading.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:32.599
And God will graciously, through His Holy Spirit, convict us.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:36.479
And I say to you this evening that conviction is a good thing.

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:43.339
It is a good thing when the Holy Spirit of God convicts us of sin in our lives.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:46.599
Sometimes we don't respond to that conviction because we don't want someone else to think

00:15:46.599 --> 00:15:47.599
we're a sinner.

00:15:47.599 --> 00:15:51.399
And the reality is that we all know that we're all sinners.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.879
Amen?

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:55.219
We all know that we're all sinners.

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:57.359
We know the truth of God's Word.

00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:00.799
If we say that we have no sin, His truth's not in us.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:03.479
We make Him a liar, 1 John 1.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:08.239
And so we find this evening that God is so gracious and He's so long-suffering, but the

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:13.079
Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to convict.

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:19.039
And I'm not sure exactly in every person's life, every individual's life, how the Holy

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:23.119
Spirit works specifically, but I know that He works.

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:30.399
And I know this truth of God's Word as well, that the believer has the ability to quench

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:33.759
and to grieve the Holy Spirit.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:39.039
We find that the Holy Spirit of God, one of His ministries with regard to lost people,

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:45.279
according to John 16, one of the ministries is that He would reprove the world of sin

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:48.839
and of righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:53.519
I think about those that the Apostle Paul stood before and preached the gospel, and

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:56.079
they were under great conviction.

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:00.639
And they were so under conviction that they said, Paul, you're mad.

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.959
You're beside yourself.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:02.959
Get out.

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.919
I'm not going to listen to you any longer.

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:10.679
Almost, Agrippa said, thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:15.959
They were under conviction, but they resisted the conviction.

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:21.119
And as a child of God, we can grieve and quench the Holy Spirit.

00:17:21.159 --> 00:17:26.439
And it's a dangerous thing to grieve and to quench the Holy Spirit.

00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:32.359
Oh, when the Holy Spirit of God takes the Word of God and convicts us of sin in our

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:35.759
lives, oh, how we ought to respond.

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:40.479
He says, I gave her space to repent.

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:45.999
But obviously, though at this time, in the time of the writing, there was no repentance,

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:51.239
and therefore the judgment is given, and it's explained to us, again, the severity

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:52.359
of the judgment.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:59.559
We read already in Numbers 25, and we referenced historically the severity of that judgment.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:05.279
But notice here, the Bible says, behold, verse 22, I will cast her into a bed, and them that

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:13.439
commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:16.599
So again, there's still this offer of repenting.

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:21.179
You know, throughout the Old Testament, especially the minor prophets, you'll read regularly

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:28.519
where the Bible says that God says, return, return, return, turn to me.

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:31.279
God is pleading with His people.

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:34.139
God is so longsuffering to His people.

00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:38.200
Think about the nation of Israel, and think about Judah and all of their wickedness and

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.959
all of their idolatry.

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:47.919
We find that God continuously raised up the prophets to come and to deliver a message,

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:53.839
and that message was, think about Isaiah 1, come and let us reason together.

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:59.200
Though your sins be as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:07.279
God is calling these people within the church here that they've allowed this false teacher,

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:11.119
this one that called herself a prophetess, and those that have been caught up with this

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.339
false teaching, He says they need to repent.

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:18.039
Notice in verse 23, and I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:20.919
that I and He would search at the reins and hearts.

00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:26.279
Now notice when He says I will kill her children with death, He's referring here not to children

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:32.079
as little kids, He's referring to those that have been influenced and instructed by the

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:33.599
way of this false teaching.

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:39.639
In other words, we would call them the followers of this way.

00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:47.399
And God says they're going to be judged, judgment's going to come.

00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:50.599
Our God is a just judge.

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:53.719
He doeth all things well and all things right.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:59.079
But we must understand this evening that as gracious and loving and merciful as He is,

00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:00.119
that He's still just.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:04.839
And He's perfect in harmony with all of those attributes.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:10.919
And we find that this judgment, the severity of it is clearly given to us here in the text

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:11.919
of Scripture.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:19.439
Can I tell you this evening, I have no desire to stand under the judgment of God.

00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:26.239
I mean honestly, when we know the judgment hand of God, the chastening hand of God, I

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:31.719
pray regularly, God, help me to respond to the conviction so that it doesn't have to

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:34.339
go beyond that.

00:20:34.339 --> 00:20:38.319
Because if I don't respond to the conviction, then the chastening will come.

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:41.399
And I don't want to deal with chastening.

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:46.159
I know that it's because God loves me and I know that it's for my good.

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:51.479
But oh, how we would learn to respond to the conviction, that we'd listen for the voice

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:57.559
of God and that we would take and follow the precepts that God has given to us so

00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:02.399
that we might please Him, honor Him, and glorify Him.

00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:08.659
The reality is that the judgment in Thyatira should have had an impact not only upon those

00:21:08.659 --> 00:21:13.999
that would receive the message in Thyatira, but upon all churches, the other churches

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:18.319
here in the book of Revelation, but even the churches throughout the church age.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.119
Notice the Bible says in verse number 23,

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:27.359
And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know, shall know what?

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:32.479
That I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:36.319
And I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:42.319
You know, the Bible says in Jeremiah 17 and verse number 9 that the heart is just deceitful

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.919
and it's desperately wicked.

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:45.239
Who can know it?

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:48.479
And verse number 10 says, I the Lord try the hearts.

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:49.799
He knows.

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:55.759
And here the Lord Jesus Christ says, I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:58.079
And he knows.

00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:00.199
He knows.

00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:06.439
We find this evening that this message of judgment with regard to the problems in Thyatira

00:22:06.439 --> 00:22:13.000
should have had an impact on others, should have an impact on us tonight.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.959
Because God is serious about holiness.

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:20.519
God is serious about holiness.

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:26.519
I want you to notice over in the book of Proverbs in chapter 19, you don't need to turn there.

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:29.239
I'm going to have you look at a passage in the book of Acts.

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:32.039
But in Proverbs 19, you might want to jot it down.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:35.159
Proverbs 19 and verse 25, the Bible says this,

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:40.000
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.319
And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:49.119
I think about the first part of that verse, smite a scorner, and the simple will beware.

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:54.000
You ever watch somebody else get punished for something, and you're like, I take note.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.319
I see someone face some consequence for an action, and I realize that that action results

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:05.440
in that consequence, and I don't want the consequence, so I learn through what they

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440
experienced.

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:12.039
I actually preached a series of messages about learning lessons that God would teach us

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:15.000
on a Wednesday evening series a few years ago.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.399
And I mentioned that we can learn from our own failures.

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:20.879
David did.

00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:23.159
David learned from his own mistakes.

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:28.839
He tried to move the ark, and he didn't follow the way that God said to have it done.

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:33.039
And he went back and he found out how it was to be done, and he did it the right way.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.599
He learned from his mistakes.

00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:37.679
And then I preached a follow-up message of that on a Wednesday evening.

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:41.959
Not only can we learn from our own mistakes, but we can learn from the mistakes of others.

00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:45.039
You know, there's some people that make the same mistake multiple times because they're

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:50.720
slow learners, and there are others that learn from the mistakes of others because they don't

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.559
want to have to experience themselves.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:58.539
Notice Acts chapter 5.

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:04.440
Even as we're turning there, many of you would be familiar with the account that begins in

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.679
Acts chapter 5 with Ananias and Sapphira.

00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:15.239
We read this account, and we are familiar with it, and we find that the Bible says in

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:20.919
verse number 1 of Acts 5, but a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:26.160
a possession and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.479
a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:34.760
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.279
keep back part of the price of the land?

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:40.079
Whilst it remained, was it not thine own?

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:43.880
And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.399
Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:51.119
Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:56.320
And Ananias, hearing these words, notice verse 5, fell down and gave up the ghost.

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.559
Do you know what that means?

00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:00.199
It means he died.

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:05.639
And great fear came on all them that heard these things.

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:11.639
You know, I read the end of verse number 5, and I say, rightly so.

00:25:11.639 --> 00:25:17.359
If you heard what took place, if you heard about what had just happened in Ananias, you

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:20.720
too would have great fear.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.720
Verse number 6, the Bible says, and the young man arose and wound him up and carried him

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.760
out and buried him.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.479
It was about the space of three hours after when his wife, not knowing what was done,

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:32.479
came in.

00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:35.600
And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.079
And she said, Yea, for so much.

00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:42.000
And Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
the Lord?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.320
Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.320
thee out.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.479
Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:56.479
And the young man came in, and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her

00:25:56.479 --> 00:25:57.479
by her husband.

00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:02.440
I read the ten verses so that I could read verse 11.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:12.440
Verse 11 says, And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.239
things.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.579
Why was there great fear?

00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:18.119
Because they saw the severe judgment.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:23.040
They saw the importance of holiness, that God was serious.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.880
Peter said to Ananias, I mean, the reality is that he didn't have to sell the possession,

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.600
and after selling it, he didn't have to give all the proceeds from the sale.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.279
But what happened is he lied.

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.279
He lied.

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:42.959
I mentioned last week, as we took the Lord's Supper, that it's so sad in our society today

00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:49.799
how commonplace it has become for people to lie.

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:52.760
Little, little regard for truth.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:27:00.399
So much so that in national polls over the last several decade or so, that nearing 50%

00:27:00.399 --> 00:27:05.479
of the American population just expect that people are lying to them and are okay with

00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:06.479
it.

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:12.479
That just doesn't make sense to me.

00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:18.359
We mentioned that because of looking at that put on and put off truth that God gives us

00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:23.959
in Ephesians chapter number 4, put off the old, put on the new.

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:31.399
One of the things he says, we're to speak the truth with every man.

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:35.600
And we notice in Acts chapter number 5, and we get to verse number 11, after reading all

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.239
that took place, that that great fear came upon the church.

00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:44.040
Our God is a consuming fire.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040
He is.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.279
He's a consuming fire.

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:51.079
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:53.919
It's what the Bible tells us.

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:59.619
And I understand that we live in an era today, and it's so much more comfortable and encouraging

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:04.239
to talk about the grace of God and the love of God, and I'm thankful for all of those

00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:12.199
attributes, but we cannot, we cannot, we must not fail to acknowledge that our God

00:28:12.199 --> 00:28:18.720
is a just judge, and He is a consuming fire.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:24.199
You think about that great message that was preached in yesteryear about those that really

00:28:24.199 --> 00:28:31.059
kind of was so instrumental in the great awakening, and the message, sinners in the hands of an

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:33.799
angry God.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:37.919
It's my understanding, and many of you have read the accounts as well, that the message

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:43.760
was just simply read in a monotone type of a voice.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.580
But he had been and he'd spent so much time with God leading up to that message.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:29:00.279
He was so overwhelmed with the truth of the holiness of God, and it had such a profound

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.039
impact.

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:05.760
I'm thankful that God is love, He is.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.179
Thankful that He's merciful, He is rich in mercy.

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:11.020
Thankful that He's gracious.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.279
But we must not forget tonight that He's the judge.

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:24.080
And He says to the church in Thyatira, you're doing some good things, there's some growth.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.339
Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, and He announces judgment.

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:31.359
What's the prescription number two?

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:33.119
What's the prescription for Thyatira?

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:34.679
What are they to do?

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:41.559
As we read verses 24 and 25, it seems that there was a portion of people within the church

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:43.640
there who had not compromised.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.919
And it seems quite obvious as you read verses 24 and 25 that the Lord Jesus Christ begins

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:55.239
to talk specifically to this group of people, and He gives instruction.

00:29:55.239 --> 00:30:00.119
We find in verse 24, He says, but unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:06.399
If many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:10.999
speak, I will put upon you none other burden.

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:18.219
But that which you have already, notice what he says, hold fast till I come.

00:30:18.219 --> 00:30:23.599
Just notice just those two words, hold fast in verse 25.

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:27.999
And really it carries with it the idea of remaining faithful.

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:31.559
It carries with it the idea of continuing.

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:37.559
And the reality is that what God is saying to these that have not known the depths of

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:42.839
Satan and they've not been wrapped up in this doctrine, he says, listen, you need to continue

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:48.319
and you need to be careful that you do not allow the wickedness to impact you.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:53.039
Notice in verse 26, he says, and he that overcometh, and then notice this phrase, and keepeth my

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:56.079
works unto the end.

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:59.639
Listen, there's some things that God has instructed us to do.

00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:01.759
There's some things that we're to be engaged in.

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:05.239
And he says, hold fast and keep my works.

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:10.479
And this is the prescription for this segment, if you will, of the church and how important

00:31:10.479 --> 00:31:15.559
it is that we acknowledge this evening the importance of holding fast.

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:21.079
Listen, compromise is all around us.

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:28.199
It seems as if every week there's temptation after temptation for you as an individual

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:36.159
and for our church collectively and corporately to go down the path of some level of compromise.

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:40.799
And we have to just determine, am I going to please God or man?

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:43.359
What am I going to do?

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:47.519
Am I going to please God, please man?

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:53.119
We find that God gives, number three, the promise for Thyatira.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:57.039
I want you to notice three things that God reminds them of.

00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:01.959
In verse 25, the verse ends with that phrase, till I come.

00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:06.559
What a great promise that we have, a reminder of Christ's return.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:11.080
When we observed the Lord's Supper last week, we mentioned that the Bible says that as often

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.039
as you do this, you do it in remembrance of me.

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:18.419
And we find that it talks about that we do show his death till he come.

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:24.199
And now we find the Lord Jesus Christ is saying to these there in Thyatira, but that which

00:32:24.199 --> 00:32:26.879
you have already, hold fast till I come.

00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:31.720
Listen, the reality this evening is that Jesus is coming.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.559
I don't know when, you don't know when, but we can rest assured that he's coming.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:40.919
And we can also rest assured that he's going to be right on time.

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:42.279
It may not be your timetable.

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:48.119
It may not be my timetable, but it will be God's perfect time.

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:53.299
We find this evening that for us and for the church in Thyatira, the reality is that we

00:32:53.299 --> 00:33:00.360
must keep our eyes on the truth that our Savior is coming and that we must be found when he

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:08.399
returns faithful in doing what he's called us to do, not being ashamed of him it is appearing.

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:13.599
I mean, as individuals or even corporately as a church, that we would not be ashamed

00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:15.619
of him at his appearing.

00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:17.599
Why are you doing the things that you're doing?

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:21.979
I was questioned last week about a particular idea and thought, and I said, listen, one

00:33:21.979 --> 00:33:27.879
of the realities is that as a church, a church has a responsibility, and as I look at our

00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:32.080
church, a responsibility that we have with any ministry that we might seek to be in,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:38.199
in just seeking to endeavor in a particular area, that we have to, how does this fit into

00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:41.199
the mission of the church?

00:33:41.199 --> 00:33:43.039
How does this bring glory to God?

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:45.399
How does this edify the believer?

00:33:45.399 --> 00:33:48.039
How does this evangelize the lost?

00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:53.360
How does this fit into the purpose of the church?

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.639
Because the church is not a club.

00:33:56.639 --> 00:33:58.279
The church is a living organism.

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:06.399
It's the bride of Christ, and we have a purpose, and everything that we do must fit in somehow

00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:11.479
to the fulfillment of that purpose that God has given to us.

00:34:11.479 --> 00:34:16.639
We find that he reminds them, till I come.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.679
Can I encourage you this evening to allow those words to resonate in your heart and

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.040
your mind, till I come.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.160
Jesus is coming.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.799
Jesus is coming.

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.799
Will he find us faithful?

00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:33.160
Will he find us faithful?

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:39.799
Notice he says in verse 26, and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him

00:34:39.799 --> 00:34:44.760
will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:50.160
vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.320
And I will give him the morning star, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.119
sayeth unto the churches.

00:34:56.119 --> 00:35:00.919
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ mentions about his coming, but then we find also that

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:03.799
he mentions about his millennial reign.

00:35:03.799 --> 00:35:07.119
We understand that really as we come to the fourth chapter of the book of Revelation,

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:11.600
I believe it's a picture, we'll deal with it in great detail as we get to that chapter

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.679
as we're studying through this book, it's a great picture, the rapture of the church.

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:20.040
I believe that God's word is very clear, that the rapture of the church will take place

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.000
followed by seven years of tribulation, and then at the end of that seven years of tribulation

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.880
there's the battle of Armageddon, and then there is the millennial reign of Christ.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:35.239
The literal millennial reign of Christ, when the Lord Jesus Christ will rule and reign

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:38.000
on earth for a thousand years.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:46.079
And he says, and the encouragement, the promise to these that would keep, hold fast, and keep

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:53.040
his words, works, the reality is that we will rule and reign with him, we'll rule and reign

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040
with him.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.839
He speaks of position and he speaks of rulership, and what privilege and responsibility is ours

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:03.139
that we can rule and reign with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:07.679
Notice if you will, skip over to Revelation chapter 20 as we look here at this portion

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:13.639
of scripture that records for us this part of the millennial reign of Christ, and Satan

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:17.760
is bound for a thousand years.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.559
At the end of the thousand years he'll be loosed for a little season according to the

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:26.639
scriptures, and then thereafter he will be smitten and he'll be cast in a lake of fire

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:29.760
where he'll suffer forever and ever.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.079
It says that he'll be tormented day and night forever and ever.

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:37.639
But I want you to notice in Revelation chapter 20, and notice in verse number four, the Bible

00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:42.040
says, and I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.820
And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.519
of God and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:53.459
mark upon their foreheads or in their hands.

00:36:53.459 --> 00:36:58.500
And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years, but the rest of the dead live

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.940
not again until the thousand years were finished.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.339
This is the first resurrection.

00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:07.100
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:13.019
On such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:19.500
and shall reign with him a thousand years.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:26.500
But the reality is that as the letter to the church in Thyatira ends, it's interesting

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:33.940
how that the letter ends with pointing the people to having an eternal perspective.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:39.579
You know what the danger is for us is to have a temporal perspective.

00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:46.299
It's a danger for the church in Thyatira, it's a danger for us to think temporally,

00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:52.100
to think just about right now and well, if we want to grow, we have to do this.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.540
There are all kinds of church growth seminars and various things that take place and they

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.899
say, oh, you got to do this and you got to change this and one of the things that they'll

00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:04.940
say is get rid of this Bible and use a different Bible and get rid of this pulpit and use a

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.000
different kind of pulpit and get rid of this piano and get some drums up here.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.660
That's what they'll tell you.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.979
And there's a danger in thinking temporally that that's what's needed.

00:38:18.979 --> 00:38:24.380
But can I tell you that there are churches just like our church that are standing for

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.380
truth, that are preaching the truth of God's Word, that are using the right Bible, singing

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:35.419
the right music, having the right standards and they're growing, why?

00:38:35.419 --> 00:38:38.419
Because they're doing God's work God's way.

00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:40.419
And God's work must be done God's way.

00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:43.940
Listen, the gospel still works.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.700
The gospel still works.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.739
Jesus still saves.

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:48.739
Do you believe that tonight?

00:38:48.739 --> 00:38:50.820
I believe that.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.979
The gospel still works.

00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:53.339
Jesus still saves.

00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:59.359
We have just the opportunity to rejoice and to know that the Lord as He closes out this

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:06.539
letter is helping these individuals, this church, to have an eternal perspective.

00:39:06.539 --> 00:39:15.859
This evening is absolutely imperative for us to see beyond this day and to see the blessings

00:39:15.859 --> 00:39:24.299
that are in store for eternity because we've pleased our Lord.

00:39:24.299 --> 00:39:31.500
I don't want to find myself, I don't want you to find yourself in a position where you've

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.299
displeased the Lord.

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:37.779
The Bible says with many of them, God was not well pleased.

00:39:37.779 --> 00:39:41.580
Paul says this in the book of Colossians and I'll finish with this tonight.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:46.580
The book of Colossians in chapter number 1, Paul says of a group of people that he's never

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:53.539
met personally but he's seeking to minister to and he has a heart for them and he says

00:39:53.539 --> 00:40:00.099
to them in Colossians 1 and verse 28, as he kind of outlines and summarizes his...

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:08.219
ministry. He says, whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:15.019
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. See, one day we're going to stand before

00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:21.219
Christ. We're going to stand before Christ one day. If you're saved tonight, you'll stand

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:28.539
at the bima, the judgment seat of Christ. The second death has no power over us. The

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:33.379
great white throne judgment is not for me. The great white throne judgment is for lost people.

00:40:33.379 --> 00:40:40.059
If you're saved tonight, it's the bima, the judgment seat of Christ. And here Paul says

00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:45.059
that we're doing this, we're actively engaged in this, why? That we may present every man

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:53.499
perfect in Christ Jesus, knowing that every believer will stand before Christ and having

00:40:53.499 --> 00:41:00.539
that eternal perspective, not just focusing on the temporal. The church in Thyatira is

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:05.659
corrected. God knew all that was going on. Oh, they had a lot of activity, they had a

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:13.739
lot of things. God mentions and He praises them for the areas of growth. He says, notwithstanding,

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:21.419
there's some problems. And I'm giving you counsel on what needs to be done and I'm letting

00:41:21.419 --> 00:41:30.139
you know that judgment will come for those that would hold fast, the great promises.

00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:36.139
Just keep on keeping on. Keep your eyes on Jesus because He's coming. And you'll rule

00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:42.939
and reign with Him for a thousand years. It's a wonderful truth of God's Word. This evening,

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:49.699
I don't know if the Holy Spirit may have touched some part of your life and convicted you of

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:55.339
something, but if so, I would encourage you, respond. Don't be like the ones there in Thyatira

00:41:55.339 --> 00:42:01.699
that God says, I gave them space to repent. But judgment was going to come because they

00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:07.099
did not repent. How many times we find in the Old Testament, how many times we find

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:11.219
even in the New Testament, the book of Revelation, we'll get there in a few chapters, how they

00:42:11.219 --> 00:42:20.019
would not repent. They would not. Hardened hearts. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing

00:42:20.019 --> 00:42:24.859
and I'm thinking I'm getting away with it. You're never going to get away with it. God

00:42:24.859 --> 00:42:30.099
sees all and He judges all. The church in Thyatira, let's pray. Father, we love You.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:35.219
We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word and the truth contained therein.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:46.259
God, I pray that You would help us tonight. He that hath ears, let him hear. God, I pray

00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:56.299
that as the churches that are represented there would learn, be impacted by this message,

00:42:56.299 --> 00:43:03.859
You would help us tonight by way of Bible preservation to be impacted and influenced

00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:10.819
by the message to the church in Thyatira. God, help us to have an eternal perspective.

00:43:10.819 --> 00:43:16.099
Help us, Lord, to hold fast and to continue in Your works. Lord, help us to seek to please

00:43:16.099 --> 00:43:21.679
You and honor You through all that we say and do. Help us to search our own hearts knowing

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:29.059
that You search the hearts. Help us, Lord, to be clean and to be pure and to be holy.

00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:32.699
Help us to be right with You and we'll thank You for it. Would you stand with me? Heads

00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:34.099
are bowed, eyes are closed.
