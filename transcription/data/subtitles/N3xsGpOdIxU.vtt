WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
to have a Bible, and what a blessing.

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.119
Numbers 14, we're gonna be jumping right in the middle

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:07.559
of a text of scripture, verses 11 through 20

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.359
will be our text this morning.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.920
In Numbers 14, verses 11 through 20,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.239
I wanna read to you by way of introduction,

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.159
verse 18 and 19, and then we'll get

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.920
into the message this morning.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.239
But notice in Numbers 14, verse number 18,

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.000
the Bible says this, this is Moses now talking back

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to the Lord, the Lord is long-suffering,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.639
is recalling what God has said, and of great mercy,

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:30.120
forgiving iniquity and transgression,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.200
and by no means clearing the guilty,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.659
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.000
unto the third and fourth generation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.740
Notice this in verse 19, pardon, I beseech thee,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.279
the iniquity of this people, according

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:47.279
unto the greatness of thy mercy,

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.319
and as thou hast forgiven this people

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.279
from Egypt even until now.

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:53.880
You'll notice there right in the midst

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.799
of verse number 19, according unto the greatness

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.200
of thy mercy, and I've used that as the title

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.459
for the message this morning.

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.480
We've spent the calendar year of 2023

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.519
talking about the truth that our God is great,

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.099
and I'm so thankful that his greatness

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.680
is revealed to us in the pages of this precious book,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.559
and what a blessing it is to know great is the Lord

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:22.199
and greatly to be praised, as we sang from Psalm 48,

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.099
verses one and two this morning,

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.440
and every service of this year, we've had the opportunity

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.879
to sing that wonderful song and be reminded,

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.680
as you come in, you see the banners on the wall,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.760
and understanding that great is the Lord,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.120
and what is it about God that makes him great?

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.040
Well, there's several things, many things,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.160
and we've been studying those things,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.080
and we've kind of, as we've kind of taken

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.919
the first part of 2023, to kind of categorize it this way,

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.160
let's discover God's greatness.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.319
What is it that would cause you,

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.319
that would cause me to say God is great?

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.160
And then, as we enter into the latter part of the year,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.639
we'll deal with the subject of declaring his greatness.

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.039
Of course, that was the theme for our missions conference

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.119
just a couple of weeks ago, and we'll spend several messages

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.360
at the end of this year.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.000
Now that we have discovered the greatness of God,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.380
we ought to be declaring the greatness of God.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.259
This morning in this text of scripture,

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.580
we find that Moses makes reference

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.500
to the greatness of God's mercy,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
and it's a blessing to consider that our God is merciful.

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.339
As we begin to think about the text of scripture

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.100
that we're in here this morning in Numbers 14,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.820
and we're looking at just the center section, if you will,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.660
of this particular chapter, but I wanna remind you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.419
of what's taking place historically

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.619
in the events of this particular chapter.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.039
It was in Numbers chapter 13 that God had given

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.020
the instruction to Moses to send those 12 spies

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.539
into the land, and we understand that God

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.740
had given the direction and their responsibility,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.220
these 12 individuals that were to go

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.619
and to spy out the land.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.320
Their job was not to come back and say whether they could

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.440
or could not take the land.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.339
Their job was simply to bring a report,

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.800
and we find that they came, and as we sing the song

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.919
with the children, and we sing in our Sunday school,

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.479
12 men went to spy on Canaan, 10 were bad.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.240
What is it about those 10 that cause us in that song

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.360
to say 10 were bad?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.800
Well, they brought an evil report.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.100
The Bible tells us that they brought that report

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.500
about the walled cities, about the defense

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.440
of the inhabitants of the land.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.639
They brought a report about the stature,

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.520
the giants that are in the land,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.600
and they reached this conclusion

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.199
that we are not able, it's an evil report,

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.759
it's a faithless report.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.080
There are two, as you enter into the 14th chapter

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.639
here in Numbers, you find that there are two

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.639
that stand up, and after they receive that evil report,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.759
the people, they are persuaded by the evil report,

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.800
and they're actually ready to go back to Egypt.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.200
There are two that stand up, Joshua and Caleb.

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:19.359
They try to steal the people.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.959
They bring that report.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.519
They did not deny the fact that the cities

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.540
were defensed, walled.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.320
They did not deny the fact that there were giants

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.880
in the land, but they said God is greater.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.540
They said God is able.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.720
They said that God is able to do what God said he would do.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.760
Well, that wasn't very well received, was it?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.000
The people were gonna take up stones,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.359
and they were gonna stone Joshua and Caleb.

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.480
They were gonna kill them because of this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.760
particular report, and we find that they rejected

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.480
the plea of Joshua and Caleb, and as we look

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.399
in the text of Scripture and we understand

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.399
contextually all that's taken place,

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:04.920
we know, and as Joshua and Caleb made it very clear,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.679
that God had given a promise to the children of Israel.

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.760
God had faithfully brought them out of Egypt,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.040
and he brought them out with the purpose

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.920
of bringing them in to that land of promise.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.880
He did not bring them out so that they could wander around,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.720
so that they could be aimless and hopeless and helpless.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.640
No, he brought them out that he might bring them in,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.380
and we find that the people, they did not believe the Lord.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.880
They did not believe the Lord.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.519
God had already revealed his great power

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.320
to this people, the children of Israel.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.720
In fact, we know that as we've studied

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.959
even in previous weeks about the greatness

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.679
of God revealed to Moses, and the way in which

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:52.480
God revealed his greatness in Horeb,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.839
when he first started that interaction with Moses,

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.339
and then how he displayed his power in Egypt,

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:02.839
and then as he brought them out and through the Red Sea,

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.720
and what a blessing to think about all

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.200
that the children of Israel had witnessed, had experienced,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.200
and yet they continue to walk by sight, and not by faith.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.679
We come to our text of scripture this morning,

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:19.760
and we find that in verse number 10,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.679
the Bible tells us of number 14,

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.959
that the people are gonna stone Joshua and Caleb,

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.600
and the Bible tells us that the Lord

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.640
then speaks to Moses in verse 11,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.000
and notice what God says,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.839
how long will this people provoke me?

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:39.839
And how long will it be ere they believe me

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.559
for all the signs which I have showed among them?

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:47.320
God wants his people to believe him.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.279
God wants us to trust him.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.200
The just shall live by faith.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.640
We find that God had revealed his power,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.640
and God had demonstrated on countless occasions

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.920
for the children of Israel what he was able to do,

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.239
and yet they're ready to return to Egypt,

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:11.200
a place where they were enslaved,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.200
a place where they cried out for deliverance from that place.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:22.279
God so graciously, powerfully delivered them.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.959
Egypt is a picture of the world in the Bible, the typology.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.200
And so we're going back to Egypt,

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:31.880
and God says, how long, Moses?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.359
How long will it be ere my people believe me?

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:38.920
Notice what God says in verse number 12.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.119
I will smite them with the pestilence,

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:49.720
and disinherit them, and will make of thee

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.600
a greater nation and mightier than they.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.200
Now can you imagine Moses hearing this?

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:04.179
For most people today, this would be a message

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:05.859
that would be gladly received.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:08.320
Oh yeah, deal with all those people,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.399
and then make of me a better, mightier nation.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.079
Moses was not a prideful man.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.720
Moses was a humble servant of the Lord, meek.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.559
He understood that God had placed him

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:27.040
in the place that he did, and we find that God,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.959
by the way, our God is a righteous judge.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.559
We understand even in previous weeks,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.799
and this morning I'm gonna preach on God's mercy.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.359
In the past couple of Sundays, we've dealt with God's love,

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.320
and I'm thankful that God is love,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.359
and I'm thankful that he's merciful.

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:45.979
We understand this morning that God is holy,

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:48.559
and God is just, and he is righteous.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.460
And I believe this morning that as we look at the nation

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.960
in which the children of Israel look at their history,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.559
but then even as we look at our own nation,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.000
I fear that sometimes there's too much of an emphasis

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.080
maybe on the positive attributes of God,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.599
and not an understanding that our God is holy,

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.760
and he's just, and he's righteous.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.880
And we find that in verse number 12,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.320
when God says, I will smite them with the pestilence

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.780
and disinherit them, listen, they deserve judgment.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.380
God always does what's right, always.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.859
Notice as we look at our text of scripture,

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:31.219
in verse 13, Moses said unto the Lord,

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:34.020
Moses the great intercessor,

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.260
standing between the people and the Lord.

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:40.820
Notice where he says, then the Egyptians shall hear it,

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.340
for thou broughtest up this people in thy might

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.460
from among them, and they will tell it

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.859
to the inhabitants of this land,

00:09:46.859 --> 00:09:51.059
for they have heard that thou, Lord, art among this people,

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:53.380
and thou, Lord, art seen face to face,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.359
and that thy clouds standeth over them,

00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:57.820
and that thou goest before them by day,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.900
time, and a pillar of cloud, and a pillar of rain.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.460
or a fire by night, now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.100
which have heard the fame of thee shall speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to bring

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.780
this people into the land, which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.340
the wilderness."

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:25.300
Moses says, now the people are going to begin to talk.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.160
If you kill all this people, they're going to reach the conclusion that it's because

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.440
you were not able, but Moses knows that God is able.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:41.040
Moses is fully convinced and persuaded that God is able to do what God said he would do,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.060
and we find that Moses stands there as an intercessor, and he is standing between the

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.140
people and God, and the people, they've already believed the evil report, they've already

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.680
prepared for returning to Egypt.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.400
They say in verse number four to one another, let us make a captain and let us return to

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.600
Egypt, but Moses stands there.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.720
As we look at this passage of scripture, if you're taking notes this morning, I want you

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.560
to notice first of all with me what Moses recalled, notice what Moses recalled.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.640
We set the scene this morning, we understand what's taking place and we find how God has

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.720
spoken to Moses and Moses has responded to the Lord, and now notice in verse 17, as we

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.160
notice what God had previously revealed and now Moses recalling this, it says in verse

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.120
17, and now I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.200
Notice what he says, according as thou hast spoken, saying, so we're noticing here what

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.720
Moses recalled.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.920
In verse number 18 and 19, I read it by way of introduction, but Moses is recalling what

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.440
God had previously said to him in Exodus 34.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.440
We'll go there in just a moment, but let me read it again.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:09.800
The Bible says this, this is Moses recalling what God has said, the Lord is long-suffering.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.180
Aren't you thankful that God's long-suffering?

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.700
Many times in our lives, I've said this over the years, I rejoice in God's long-suffering

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.860
in my life more than I do in God's long-suffering in your life.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.860
Why is that?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.620
Well, it's just kind of a human nature.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.140
We're so thankful when God's long-suffering to us.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.780
And then sometimes we're so, God, why aren't you dealing with that person?

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.100
But God's long-suffering.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:48.980
Notice what it says, and of great mercy, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.740
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.740
Notice in verse 19, pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of this people.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.140
And so we find in verse 18 what Moses had recalled.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.980
Mercy is a distinguishing attribute of God.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:13.220
We find that this morning, we can be merciful, but it's only because God is merciful.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.980
And as God's people are to be like God, then we can show mercy, but this truth, this attribute

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.660
is distinguishing, it is a distinguishing attribute of God.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.100
God, if we were to speak about mercy this morning, we could simply define it this way,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.900
it is God not giving us what we deserve.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.500
God not, you know what these people deserve?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.820
They deserve judgment.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.740
They deserve judgment.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:45.220
And God said to Moses, here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to smite them and I'm going

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.800
to make of thee a greater nation in verse number 12.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:56.220
But Moses recalled something, and what he recalled was that God is a God of great mercy.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.500
Go back to Exodus chapter 34 if you will.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:07.420
Note in Exodus chapter number 34 that there's some very important things that had previously

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.500
happened to this chapter.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.500
In Exodus chapter number 20 we read of the great, the Ten Commandments, and then we find

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.140
that God begins to give Moses all of the instruction with regard to the tabernacle.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:27.180
God is revealing the pattern that he should use to build the tabernacle and all of the

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.980
furniture and all that's taking place.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:36.260
And while Moses is up there on the mount and receiving the instruction from God, we find

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.020
that there's a problem in the camp.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:45.420
We find that the people, they break the law, they break the covenant, and God has them

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:51.620
go and Moses and Joshua return, and we find that as Moses is coming back, he hears what's

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.140
taking place, they hear this noise of war in the camp is how it's described by Joshua,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.780
we find that they arrive and they find that there are calves that have been created.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.100
These are your gods.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:13.320
It's a terrible scene, unfortunate set of circumstances.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:21.860
We find that these people had sinned, but then they repented, if you read chapter 33.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.260
And you come to chapter 34, and you find that it's in Exodus chapter 34 that God would

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.960
renew the covenant that had just been broken by his people.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.020
And as he renews the covenant and as he's speaking to Moses, notice the Bible says this

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.700
in verse number 6 of Exodus 34, and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.820
There's a Lord speaking, it says in verse number 1, and the Lord said unto Moses, so

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.940
we see that God is speaking, he's speaking here to Moses, and notice what he says, the

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:02.540
Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:09.380
truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.020
will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.220
and upon the children's children and to the third and to the fourth generation.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.580
Isn't it amazing, as you read the account in Numbers chapter 14, our text for this morning,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.660
that when we deal with this truth, as we look through this passage of scripture, we notice

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:34.500
first what Moses recalled, Moses recalled exactly what God had previously revealed to

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500
him.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.700
And I think about Moses making this recollection as mine, and I think about what the prophet

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.100
says, the prophet Jeremiah, you don't need to turn there, but in the book of Lamentations,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.580
the third chapter, a very familiar passage of scripture for us, but we find that the

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.660
third chapter of the book of Lamentations in verse number 21, here's what the writer

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:04.940
says, this I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:14.220
It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:21.500
Where new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.860
Jeremiah, after the Babylonian captivity, as he's lamenting all that's taken place,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.580
he says, this I recall, therefore have I hope.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.580
What?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.740
It is of the Lord's mercies.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.740
The Lord's mercies.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.980
Notice what the psalmist says, notice in Psalm 77, if you would turn there, Psalm 77, and

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.780
notice what the Bible says in these few verses of scripture.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.500
We won't read the entirety of the Psalm, but we find that in the first verse of Psalm 77,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.820
that the psalmist reveals that he's trying out to the Lord.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.860
He's in a day of trouble, according to verse number two, and he says, I've sought the Lord,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.380
but we'll pick it up in verse number six, the Bible says this, I call to remembrance

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.900
my song in the night.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.140
I commune with mine own heart, my spirit made diligent search.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.940
Notice what he asks, these questions, will the Lord cast off forever?

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.740
And will He be favorable no more?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.140
Is His mercy clean gone forever?

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.060
Doth His promise fail forevermore?

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.340
Hath God forgotten to be gracious?

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.180
Hath He in anger shut up His tender mercies?

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180
Selah.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.860
Listen, there are times you might feel this way.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.660
You know what's different about us and the psalmist, and we understand some of the inspirational

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.780
Holy Spirit of God, but for far too many of us, we fail in this area of transparency.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.320
And even being transparent with the Lord, there are times in which we deal with difficulties

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.740
in our lives.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.340
We might not be very transparent about what's going on, but we see the psalmist in this

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.140
time of trouble, and he's going through, and he's asking these questions, and he's just

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.420
struggling with what's going on, but then notice in verse number 10, I'm thankful he

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.619
doesn't continue down that path that says, and I said, this is my infirmity, but I will

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:12.260
remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.700
I will remember the works of the Lord.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.540
Surely, I will remember thy wonders of old.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.340
I will meditate also of all thy work and talk of all thy doings.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.220
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.900
Who is so great a God as our God?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.420
Thou art the God that doest wonders.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.580
Thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.700
I mentioned last Sunday as we talked about God's love, and in John 13 is where we started

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.140
last Sunday morning, that He loved them unto the end.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:52.020
We talked much about that cycle that I talked about last Sunday morning with regard to reminding

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:58.040
ourselves that God loves us, and then resting in His love, and then rejoicing for His love.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.040
I'm so thankful that as we go through that process.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:08.040
that I said that we need to remind ourselves of God's love for us. Why? Because there are times in which the accuser, the brethren,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:15.040
would like to whisper to you and whisper to me that God has forgotten us and God's not loving us and God's mercies are dried up,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:23.040
as the psalmist says here in Psalm 77. But no, we remind ourselves that no, God does love me. No, God is merciful.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:35.040
And we find that here in this passage of scripture in Numbers 14 that Moses has recalled what God has previously revealed.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:44.040
It's so important for us to be students of God's word. You cannot recall what you do not know.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:55.040
You just can't. We understand we speak about God's word and we talk about revelation, all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:03.040
and we understand that God was speaking through His men. Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:12.040
But you understand that the canon of scripture is closed. God's given us this book and He's told us to be students of this book.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:19.040
We're to read it and study it and meditate upon it and memorize it. We're to get into this book and someone said this,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:26.040
to know God is to know His word. And I can't recall what I simply do not know.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:38.040
And Moses is able to recall these truths with regard to the attributes of God because he knew them.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:49.040
Because he knew them. Because God had revealed them to him. I'm thankful that in this book God's revealed to us everything that we need to know.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:55.040
He said this, He says He's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:05.040
There's nothing that you need or that I need to live this Christian life in a manner which is pleasing to God that He's not given us.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.040
He has given us the Holy Spirit of God and He has given us the word of God.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.040
And we find that He's given us everything that we need.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:22.040
And I'm thankful that as we go through, listen, I've not memorized the Bible.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:29.040
I don't have the whole Bible memorized. But I read it. I study it. I spend time in it.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.040
You know what's amazing? Because the Holy Spirit of God lives within me.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.040
And because I've spent time in this book, you've experienced it as well.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:52.040
The Holy Spirit of God will remind you of truth that you've read, that you've studied, that you've heard preached.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.040
He'll remind you. Because the Holy Spirit of God lives within us. He's the author of this book.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.040
And He'll remind us. Listen, it's a good thing that Moses recalled this truth.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:11.040
In this particular setting, in this circumstance in which Israel is dealing with, Moses recalls great truth.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.040
Jason Starnes, he was actually here last Sunday, but he asked me this question years ago.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.040
He said, Pastor, it seems like I watch as you preach.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.040
And he said, you know, he was just making some comments.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.040
And he said this. He said, every once in a while when you're preaching,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.040
it just seems as if you go to a verse of Scripture that you really didn't have in your notes.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.040
And that it was something that maybe you didn't plan to say.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.040
Is that true? Is that a good observation? And I said, Jason, it is.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.040
He said, I thought that might be the case. He said, can you help me understand that?

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.040
I said, well, just at certain times as you're preaching, as you're delivering the message,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.040
the Holy Spirit of God will remind you of a verse of Scripture.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.040
And it's as if he says, you need to go there.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.040
I'm not patting myself on the back. I'm just simply saying,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:05.040
God will help us to recall as we get into this book.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:12.040
Notice not only what Moses recalled, but I want you to notice what Moses requested.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.040
As we continue reading in Numbers 14, we read very specifically what Moses requested.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.040
But I want you to understand this morning that Moses, I believe this morning,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:32.040
that Moses would not have made the request that he made had he not recalled the truth that he did.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:43.040
The request that is made in verse number 19 in one word, pardon, pardon, pardon.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:52.040
The request is so simple, but the request that is made by Moses in this text of Scripture,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:59.040
the basis of this request is what he recalled, what God had previously revealed to him.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.040
Notice it says this, pardon, I beseech thee.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.040
Do you see the passion, if you will, of Moses? He's speaking to God.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.040
He's heard what God has said. He's experienced.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.040
I mean, can you imagine Moses as a leader?

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.040
He sends these 12 guys out to go spy off the land.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.040
He knows that God has given him the instruction to go and to possess the land.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.040
And these 12 guys come back and Moses is there as the human leader.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.040
And he has these 12 guys come back and he's observing.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040
He's seeing what's happening.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.040
And these 10 guys bring this evil report, this faithless report,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.040
and the whole congregation sides with them and says, yeah, let's go back to Egypt.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.040
Can you imagine Moses as a leader? I'm defeated. I'm discouraged.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.040
What's going on?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:48.040
Two guys, Joshua and Caleb, they say, hey, hey, listen, God is able.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040
And then they're going to stone those guys.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.040
Say, what's going on?

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.040
And God then speaks to them.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.040
Says, I'm going to smite them.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.040
I'm going to build of thee a greater nation.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.040
But Moses recalls God's great mercy.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.040
And he says, pardon, I beseech thee.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.040
We read that phraseology as we speak about Paul in Romans 12.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.040
And so often we reference that in that portion of Scripture.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.040
I beseech thee, therefore, by the mercies of God,

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.040
to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.040
which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.040
but be transformed.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.040
And we find that as we look at what's taking place and we find that Moses here,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:42.040
he says, I beseech thee, the passion that Moses has, he says, pardon,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.040
I beseech thee, the iniquity of Moses?

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.040
No. Of this people.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.040
Of this people.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.040
Of this people.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.040
God told Moses, I'll build of thee a greater nation.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.040
Moses wasn't the offender.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.040
Moses wasn't the one that had no faith.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.040
Moses wasn't the one that was walking by sight.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:19.040
But Moses says, Lord, pardon, I beseech thee,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.040
the iniquity of this people, notice what he says,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:31.040
according unto the greatness of thy mercy.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.040
According unto the greatness of thy mercy.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:43.040
We find, again, the basis of the request is God's great mercy.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.040
And then notice as you continue in verse 19, the Bible says,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:56.040
and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt, even until now.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.040
Think about that phrase to end verse 19.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.040
His mercy has been regularly on display.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.040
He had forgiven his people.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.040
You think about the children of Israel.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.040
I mean, right after they enter or cross over the Red Sea,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.040
the complaining begins immediately.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.040
We've mentioned about the mermaid.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.040
I mean, they sing this great song in Exodus chapter number 15

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.040
about the deliverance and all that God has done.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.040
And then they get to a place where there's bitter water

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.040
and they start complaining immediately.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.040
And then they complain that there's nothing to eat.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.040
Then later on, they'll complain that they don't like what God provided for them.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.040
And just the murmuring.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.040
And here, we find that Moses is praying.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.040
He's pleading with God.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.040
He's interceding on the behalf of the people

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.040
that God would pardon them according to the greatness of his mercy.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:00.040
And he says this, as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt, even until now.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.040
Moses makes a bold request.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.040
His request is made because of what he had recalled.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:14.040
He recalled what God had revealed to him as noted in Exodus 34.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.040
I'm thankful that God's mercy is on display throughout his word.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.040
You can read over and over throughout God's word

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.040
of God's mercy being on full display.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:34.040
You've experienced in your life, and I've experienced in my life, God's mercy.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.040
And I'm so thankful this morning that Moses would stand

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.040
between the people and the Lord,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.040
and he would cry out and he would beseech the Lord,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:50.040
and he would say that it's not because they deserve it.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.040
Because what they deserve was judgment.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.040
I don't deserve to be forgiven.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040
You don't deserve to be forgiven.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.040
But I'm certainly thankful that God chose to forgive me.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:10.640
us. What a blessing. You can't earn forgiveness. You can't. There are people that try. There

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.160
are religious systems that have been designed and developed to try to persuade people that

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:24.240
they can do something to earn forgiveness, to buy God's favor. It's not possible. It's

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:32.400
not possible. As we look at the passage of Scripture here in Numbers 14, we note first

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.880
what Moses recalled and what he requested, but now I want you to notice as we finish

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:45.980
the passage of Scripture here in verse number 20, I want you to notice how God responded.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:54.780
Notice how God responded. It's a simple verse of Scripture. The Lord speaks back to Moses.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:01.340
Now again, I hope in your mind's eye, as I'm thinking about the events of this passage

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:07.060
and I've sought to try to explain them quickly to you this morning, Moses is there and he

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.800
sees all that's happened and all the interaction of the people and the congregation and God

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:19.600
then speaks to Moses. But then Moses speaks back to the Lord and he rehearses some things

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:26.200
that he recalls and he makes a request and now God speaks back to Moses. And he says

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:36.480
this in verse number 20, I have pardoned. I have pardoned according to thy word. I want

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.640
you to think about that statement, I have pardoned, and we find that it's according

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.600
to thy word because Moses had made the request and we find that God is not going to judge

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.880
these people, he's not going to smite these people at this particular time. If you continue

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:59.240
reading you understand that this particular group of people, they will die in the wilderness

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.440
and so on and so forth, they will not enter into the land of promise, but at this particular

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:12.200
time they receive mercy. They receive mercy. And God says I have pardoned according to

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.520
thy word. It's being to think about the response of God and we see what's taking place and

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.480
reminded of the book of Nehemiah, turn over there if you will, in Nehemiah chapter number

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:28.840
7 and we fast forward in Israel's history by a long period of time as you come to the

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:34.200
book of Nehemiah in chapter number 9. You come to the book of Nehemiah and you find

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.280
that here in this portion of scripture it's amazing as you think about where we are there

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:46.840
in numbers, they've not yet entered into the land of promise, the children of Israel. They

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.280
would wander for all of those years in the wilderness and they would eventually go into

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:59.120
the land. They would conquer, divide and inhabit the land. They'd go through a period

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:06.920
of judges for nearly 450 years and Samuel would come on the scene as a prophet. We find

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:16.320
they'd ask for a king and God gives them a king and Saul and David and Solomon. Then

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.120
the kingdom is divided and the nation of Israel, the ten tribes of the north, no good

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:31.720
kings after the divided kingdom, downhill the whole way, taken captive by the Assyrians.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.320
The nation of Judah, the two tribes of the south, periods of time in their history where

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:46.000
there are good kings, revival, prophets of God, people responding and getting right and

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.560
God sending revival. But eventually they too are taken captive, they by the Babylonians.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.640
And then we come to the book of Nehemiah. I mean all that history between numbers 14

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:13.240
and Nehemiah. Hundreds of years. You come to Nehemiah, this remnant is going to return.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:21.520
We find that Nehemiah begins in verse number 16, but they and our fathers dealt proudly

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.200
and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey. Neither

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.560
were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their necks and in

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.320
the rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. Sound familiar to what we

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:45.880
were just talking about in numbers 14? Notice where it says, but thou art a God, ready to

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:56.520
pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness, and forsookest them

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.800
not. If you skip down, we don't have time to look at all that's taken place, but if

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.400
you skip down to verse number 31, notice what the Bible says, nevertheless for thy great

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:16.280
mercy's sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them, for thou art a gracious

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:26.120
and merciful God. This morning we find that God desires that we as His children would

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:33.080
know that He is a merciful God. He desires that we would have that knowledge. Listen,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:38.080
He's revealed and recorded it for us through the pages of this precious book that each

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:47.240
of us would have this confident knowledge that God is a merciful God. I believe for

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.680
each of us that are gathered here this morning that have personally been the recipients of

00:35:51.680 --> 00:36:01.360
God's mercy, that we would stand and rejoice and thank God that He's a merciful God. But

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.440
there's a world that does not know that our God is a merciful God. And just as He's been

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.800
merciful to you and to me, He's ready to pardon. He's a merciful God. Then you understand that

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.360
I can't, you can't, I can't pray for someone else to be saved. It's a personal matter.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:27.400
It's a personal decision. But I wonder this morning how many people we come in contact

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:35.960
with that don't know that God is merciful. That God is ready to pardon. I think about

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:45.600
that term, ready, or that phrase, ready to pardon. God is not in a situation where He's

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.960
like, well, I guess, you know, if you, if you, if you really twist my arm, then I'll,

00:36:49.960 --> 00:37:00.720
no, He's ready to pardon. He's ready to pardon. He's ready to forgive. And this morning someone

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:09.880
took the time to reveal to you and to reveal to me that God is merciful. And I'm thankful.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:20.440
If you would have asked me 30 years ago, is God merciful? I have no idea. Zero knowledge

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:27.240
to be able to answer that question. But today I can stand with great boldness and confidence

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.040
and say that I know that God is merciful. Number one, I can take you to a number of

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:38.800
passages of Scripture, just as we've looked at here this morning, that God is merciful.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.360
As part of His very being, He's a merciful God. But I can also tell you how that I've

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:51.360
received personally God's mercy. Notice that passage of Scripture in the book of Ephesians,

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.640
if you will, and we'll close with this passage this morning. So we look in Ephesians chapter

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:12.560
number two. Moses recalled what God had previously revealed. That message that he recalled contained

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:21.800
within it the various attributes of our God and one of them being that He's of great mercy.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:31.820
Because of what he recalled, he made a bold request. Pardon, I beseech thee. Pardon according

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:43.680
unto the greatness of thy mercy. And God responded and said, I have pardoned. And notice

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.600
this in Ephesians two, verse number one, and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:56.740
and sins. Weren't in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.060
to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:05.500
disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.700
of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:16.180
the children of wrath even as others. Listen, we were all in the same position. For all

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:23.220
have sinned, come short of the glory of God. The first two words of verse number four,

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:36.720
but God. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us. He didn't

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.620
give us what we deserved. In fact, in this passage of scripture, you'll begin reading

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:47.700
about the grace of God. God giving us what we do not deserve. Some have described it

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:54.380
as God's riches at Christ's expense. I know Ronnie likes to use that phraseology and it's

00:39:54.380 --> 00:40:00.940
good. And this morning we see that he then continues and speaks about the grace of God

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.940
but

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.740
But a sister passage of Scripture in Titus in verse 3 and verse number 5 says,

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:13.440
"...not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy."

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440
He saved us.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:23.500
"...by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, but God who is rich in

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.540
mercy."

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.980
He's rich in mercy.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:33.060
This morning I'm thankful that someone told me that God was merciful.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:40.680
I see in the passage of Scripture this morning in Numbers 14 how Moses recalls this and he

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:46.220
stands as an intercessor between the people and God.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.820
This morning, I want to see people saved.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:57.480
You know, it grieves my heart to be very transparent with you this morning.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:05.860
It grieves my heart when I hear Christian people say and desire for God's judgment

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.600
upon lost people.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.320
I hear it and it grieves my heart.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.880
Why?

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.320
Because I've read Revelation 20.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.520
And when you read Revelation 20, you read about that second death, to be cast in a lake

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.480
of fire.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.560
You can't wish that on anybody.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:45.520
As a child of God and as a recipient of God's mercy, it ought never cross our lips.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.000
God judged those people.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.520
I've always said God saved those people.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.600
God, just as you've been merciful to me, would you be merciful to them?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:05.040
Listen, I can't pray for them to be saved, but God's called us to go give them a message.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:15.720
And it grieves my heart that there are believers that have that opinion of certain peoples

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:28.080
around the world, whether they're of a different religion or whatever the case might be.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.120
We see a lot of wickedness in our world.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:39.360
We're dealing in a time like they did in the Old Testament with Jeremiah and Isaiah, where

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.400
they call evil good and good evil.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.160
And they legislate wickedness.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.840
We're living in a time like that.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:56.880
And if we're not careful, we can get this, God judged them.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:02.320
How about God saved them?

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.120
We sing the song, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:19.320
We sing the song about being redeemed, oh, how I love to proclaim it.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320
Redeemed how?

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.360
By the blood of the Lamb, redeemed, redeemed.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.560
We sing about telling the old, old story.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:39.560
As you read that song and sing those words, for some have never heard.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.520
There's so many that have never heard.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.160
They don't know this morning that God is merciful.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.560
And who's going to tell them?

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.520
Do you think our politicians are going to tell them that God is merciful?

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.480
Seriously.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:03.040
Do you think our educators are going to tell them that God is merciful?

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:10.280
Do you think Hollywood's going to tell them that God is merciful?

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:18.520
Those that have been the recipients of God's mercy are the ones that not only have been

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:27.280
appointed to, but that are most qualified to tell them that God is merciful.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.400
Why?

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.880
We've received it.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.640
We've experienced it.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.520
We know that God is rich in mercy.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:43.240
This morning, I hope that we would rejoice in knowing the mercy of God, but I hope this

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:53.720
morning that we'd have a burden to tell someone that our God is rich in mercy.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.720
I understand that when you share the gospel, you've got to convince them.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:05.440
They've got to know they're lost and that their sin carries with it a consequence.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.960
It's absolutely essential that that's part of the gospel presentation, but oh how wonderful

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:19.680
it is to get to that point, but God, but God who is rich in mercy.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:30.080
I hope this morning we leave here encouraged because we know that God is merciful, comforted

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.960
and be reminded that God has been merciful to us, but I hope that we leave challenged.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.280
God would you help me?

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:47.080
Help me this week to have an opportunity to tell somebody of God's great mercy.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.360
Why is your God great?

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.720
Because of his great works, yeah, because of his great power, absolutely, because of

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.040
his great mercy.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:04.280
His mercy is beyond our ability to fully comprehend.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.760
He is great in mercy.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760
Let's pray.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.000
Father, we love you.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Thank you for loving us.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.120
I pray Lord that you would help us this morning to be encouraged.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:23.960
I pray that we'd rejoice greatly as we're reminded of your great mercy, how thankful

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.440
we are.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.600
I pray that we'd be challenged in our own lives, personally.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.240
God would you use us this week?

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.120
Help us to be specific about it.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:42.800
Lord, help us to pray for the opportunity and then look for the opportunity and seize

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.320
the opportunity.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:52.680
Help us, God, this week to tell somebody about your great mercy, that just as we have been

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:59.800
the recipients of your great mercy and you saved us, you'll save them.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.080
I thank you that you're able to save to the uttermost.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.360
I thank you that you've told us in your word that you're not willing that any should perish,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:15.000
but that all should come to repentance.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:31.640
I think of the Apostle Paul before his conversion, religious but lost, against Christianity,

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:37.040
trusting unto the death of Stephen, hailing men and women of that sort, taking them to

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.040
prison.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.960
But God, your mercy, your mercy.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:51.520
Thankful that you revealed yourself to Saul and he trusted Christ, used him in such an

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.920
amazing way.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:48:04.000
God, I pray this morning, would you help us to tell someone about your great mercy?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.080
Work in these moments of invitation, have your will in way, for it's in Christ's name

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080
we pray.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080
Would you stand with me?

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.600
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
