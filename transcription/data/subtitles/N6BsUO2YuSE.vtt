WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Judges chapter number seven, as you know,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.360
our Missions Conference is just a couple of weeks away

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.359
and it's my prayer and my desire

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.880
that we will be prepared spiritually

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.720
for the special conference.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.399
And Missions Conference is really,

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.559
in my mind and my estimation,

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.340
it's almost like a combination of revival meeting,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.600
tight preaching, plus opportunity to hear

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.159
about particular fields and ministries

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.340
that God has called people to.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.579
Obviously, our ultimate desire

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.779
is that the Lord Jesus Christ alone

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.139
would be exalted and magnified through all that's done.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.619
And last week on Sunday evening,

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.220
in preparation for our Missions Conference,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.759
we examined a portion of Exodus chapter number three.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:50.099
And as we examined a portion of that familiar chapter,

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:54.700
we said that there were at least two obvious truths

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.900
that God gave us that are just abundantly clear.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.299
And that is, God has a plan

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.720
and his plan includes his people.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.660
And God's plan was to deliver his people,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.139
the children of Israel, from Egyptian bondage.

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.160
He was gonna bring them out so that he could bring them in,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.000
but we find that he's gonna use Moses

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.180
and God's plan includes God's people.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.739
And I'm thankful for that.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:21.339
The second wonderful truth from that passage

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:24.220
that we focused on was that God promises

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.339
to be with his people as they do

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:30.220
what he has commanded them to do.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.940
And I'm thankful for the promise of God's presence.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.059
He said, certainly I will be with thee.

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:38.540
And what a precious truth that is,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.139
that God gave to Moses with regard to the task

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:47.139
that was at hand and that Moses would have that promise

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.059
that God would be with him.

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.980
And so this evening,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.639
and there were other truths that we looked at,

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.720
but those two particular with regard to this preparation

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.839
for our missions conference,

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.360
as we come to this portion of scripture,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.919
as we continue preparation for this special conference,

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.959
we come to Judges chapter number seven.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.279
And I really wanna focus on a phrase in verse 21

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.600
that I have used for the message title this evening.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100
I'll read the entirety of the verse.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.559
The Bible says in Judges seven and verse 21,

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.800
and they, that's the 300 men,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.039
we'll deal with that in just a moment,

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.000
but they stood every man in his place

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.600
round about the camp and all the hosts ran

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.880
and cried and fled.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.639
I've titled the message this evening,

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.800
every man in his place.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.559
You think about the book of Ezekiel,

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.639
God gives this indictment that God sought for a man

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.000
among them that should stand in the gap

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.800
to make up and hedge, but he found,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
the Bible says he found none.

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.000
And what a sad indictment against the nation of Israel

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.880
with regard to that portion of scripture

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.199
in the book of Ezekiel.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.320
And as we look here in Judges chapter number seven,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.800
many of us this evening are familiar

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.720
with the events that are recorded for us

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.080
in the book of Judges.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.759
God's people had entered into the land of promise.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.960
They had conquered, they had inhabited.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.279
The division of the land is recorded.

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.880
You go through the book of Joshua.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.039
We find that Joshua gives charges

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.520
at the end of the book of Joshua to the people.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.960
There's a series of charges that he gives.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.360
And then the Bible tells us that Joshua died.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.039
You enter into the book of Judges,

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.880
you find that there's a little historical data

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.000
that's given at the very beginning of the book

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.839
with regard to that which I just discussed

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.720
with regard to what had just taken place

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.080
in Israel's history.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.720
And then you find that the Bible tells us

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.600
that there arose another generation

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.800
and this generation that rose up,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.839
unfortunately they did not continue to serve the Lord.

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.880
And because of their idolatry,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.440
because of their disobedience,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.919
because of their wickedness, God judged them.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.039
And what God did is he raised up certain people groups

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.520
to judge his own people.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.600
And he would raise up these particular groups of people

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.880
to judge the children of Israel

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880
because of their disobedience.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.119
The children of Israel were not given a free pass

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.199
because they were God's chosen people, no.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.919
They had been given the responsibility to live

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.119
according to the precepts that God had prescribed.

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:23.880
And he gave them many times a warning.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.720
If you do this, here will be the blessings.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.600
But if you obey not, here will be the judgments

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.720
or the curses.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.799
And we find that in the book of Judges,

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:36.559
what would happen is a group of people

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.359
would really oppress the children of Israel

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:41.920
and they would be under judgment.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.359
And because of the adversity and the difficulties

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.959
they would face, they would cry out to God.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:52.160
They would promise to not serve the idols any longer.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760
And God would graciously raise up a judge

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.959
and judge that people group that had been oppressing

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.200
the children of Israel.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.679
And then there would be a period of time

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.399
where there would be freedom, if you will.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.959
There would be no group of people,

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.799
no nation that would be oppressing the children of Israel.

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:14.200
And then the children of Israel, after a little while,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.920
they would backslide right back into idolatry

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.000
and so on and so forth.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.040
And really the book of Judges is this big cycle

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.399
that you just keep reading how that they keep repeating

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.239
their history.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.920
It's really a sad period of history

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.959
in the nation of Israel's history.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.320
In fact, it's in this book of Judges that we read

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.679
every man did that which was right in his own sight.

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.200
So we find that as we have some level of understanding

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200
of the content of the book of Judges,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.679
and then specifically as we think about the Judge Gideon,

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.760
there are many of us that have heard at least aspects

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.959
of the life and ministry, if you will, of Gideon,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.799
of the work that God did through Gideon

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:59.920
to deliver his people from the Midianites.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.160
You can read of Gideon in chapter six, seven, and eight.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
We're gonna focus in chapter number seven this evening

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.320
and looking at this statement, every man in his place

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.480
in seeking to make application with regard

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
to our responsibility to be in our place.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.640
And as we look at this passage,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.559
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:27.119
they understood their responsibility.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.799
They understood their responsibility.

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:31.000
Now this is really a basic truth,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.119
but the reality this evening is that you will not fulfill

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.760
a responsibility that you do not know about.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.079
And so we find here that as we look at this portion

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:43.000
of scripture, the Bible begins in verse number one,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.279
and it says, then Jerubbabel, who is Gideon,

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.399
and all the people that were with him rose up early

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.040
and pitched beside the well of Herod,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.519
so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:56.959
of them by the hill of Morah in the valley.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:58.880
And notice in verse number two, the Bible says,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.920
the Lord said unto Gideon, the people that are with thee

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.600
are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.359
lest Israel vaunt themselves against me,

00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:11.880
saying, mine own hand hath saved me.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.040
God knows the heart of his people.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.600
God knows your heart this evening.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.480
He knows my heart this evening.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.839
And he said that with an army of 32,000 people,

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.480
which by the way, they were far outnumbered,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.480
but with an army of 32,000, that if God gave them

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.140
the victory, that the children of Israel would be prideful

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.160
and arrogant and say, look at what we did.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.600
We conquered the Midianites.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.160
And so God says to Gideon, your army is too big.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.200
And so therefore, we find in verse number three,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.320
the Bible says now, therefore, go to,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.920
proclaim in the ears of the people saying,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.619
whosoever is fearful and afraid,

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:52.519
let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:56.559
And they returned to the people 20 and 2,000

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.119
and the remain 10,000.

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:02.519
Now we understand as you look back in the sixth chapter,

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.160
the Midianites, this large group of people

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.519
that are gathered, the Bible tells us

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:11.140
that both they and their camels were without number

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.480
in verse number five.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.320
We also find that when Gideon was first found,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.720
he is threshing wheat in a hiding place really

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.480
so that he could not be seen because at the time

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.279
in which the Midianites would see this activity,

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:28.320
they would sweep in and they would take the spoil

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720
and the people were living in fear.

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.799
And so these 32,000 people, these 32,000 men are gathered

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.599
and God says, tell the people,

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:41.119
if any of them are fearful or afraid, they can go home.

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:42.960
Bam, 22,000 left.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.320
They just left, they just went home.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.799
And so God says they have 10,000 people

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.799
and notice what the Lord says in verse number four,

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.679
the Lord said to Gideon, the people are yet too many.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:55.239
Bring them down under the water

00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:58.140
and I will try them for thee there.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.299
And it shall be that of whom I say unto thee,

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:04.299
this shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:06.859
And of whomsoever I say unto thee, this shall not go

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.900
with thee, the same shall not go.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.260
So who's making the decision?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.479
God's making the decision.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.140
By the way, God didn't say which group he was gonna choose

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.820
until after the test was completed.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.359
And we find that God was the one that was making the choice

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:26.940
and he says to Gideon what to do there in verse number four

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.059
and verse five, so he brought down the people

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:30.080
under the water.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.179
The Lord said unto Gideon, everyone that lappeth

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:34.099
of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth,

00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:35.820
him shalt thou set by himself.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.479
Likewise, everyone that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:41.299
So there's gonna be two methods by which people

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:43.880
are gonna drink of this water and I want you

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.059
to set one group over here and another group over here.

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:49.820
You're gonna divide them based upon how they partake

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.659
of the water.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.479
The Bible says the number of them that lapped,

00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:55.900
putting their hand to their mouth were 300 men.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.919
But all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees.

00:09:58.919 --> 00:09:59.919
to drink water.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:06.359
And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that laughed will I save you,

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:11.979
and deliver the Midianites into thine hand, and let all the other people go, every man

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:14.279
into his place.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:20.219
Verse 8, notice the Bible says, So the people took vittles in their hand, and their trumpets,

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:25.499
and he sent all the rest of Israel, every man into his tent, and retained those three

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:27.179
hundred men.

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:30.819
The host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:35.339
As we begin to think about the understanding of these three hundred men with regard to

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:40.619
their responsibility, I believe as you look at the text, as we've just read these verses,

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:44.939
they were chosen by God for this specific task.

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:51.899
We find that there were 22,000 that of their own will, they departed when Gideon says whoever

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.599
is afraid or whoever is fearful, they can return.

00:10:55.599 --> 00:11:03.839
And then as God provides for Gideon this, what seems to be a menial type of an activity

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:09.239
to just partake of some water, that he would divide the group and he would say now this

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:10.239
is the group.

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:16.499
And notice in verse number 7, the Bible says that he gives this promise, God gives this

00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:21.159
promise by the three hundred men that laughed will I save you.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:29.479
In verse number 8, the Bible tells us that Gideon sent the other 9,700 back and those

00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:33.759
three hundred men he retained with them.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:37.399
They're gaining an understanding of what their responsibility is.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:43.919
God is making clear here to these three hundred men, I believe this evening it is imperative

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:48.239
for God's people to understand their responsibility.

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:50.159
We've been given responsibility.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:53.919
We have a responsibility to honor the Lord, to glorify God in all that we do.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:12:00.239
Whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God, 1 Corinthians.

00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:05.319
We find that we understand in the book of John in the 15th chapter that when we bear

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:08.799
fruit that we bring glory to God.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:15.119
And we find that we as the children of God, we've been given a responsibility to be His

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:18.539
representatives, to be His ambassadors.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:22.299
We understand that as you study through the book of Acts, you begin to study the first

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:31.499
century church, how those disciples and those early converts, they understood their responsibility.

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:37.899
And it's absolutely imperative that God's people understand that we have a responsibility,

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:42.339
that we're not just walking through life thinking, you know, this is just wonderful and I don't

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:47.139
have anything to do, I have no responsibility, I'm just going to heaven one day.

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:54.299
If all that God had planned for us was to go to heaven, I believe at the moment that

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:57.099
we were saved we'd go to heaven.

00:12:57.099 --> 00:13:02.019
But God left us here to be His ambassadors, His representatives.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:03.019
We have a responsibility.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:14.379
Let me say this, ignorance regarding our biblical responsibilities does not eliminate our accountability.

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:16.979
See we're accountable to God.

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:24.219
And ignorance regarding biblical responsibility does not eliminate our accountability.

00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:25.219
We're accountable.

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:27.099
Every man's going to stand before God.

00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:32.019
And there are times in which you, you'll use the phrase, we've heard it no doubt, where

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:34.739
people say you have your head in the sand.

00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:39.539
And the idea is that you don't want to be aware of whatever is taking place, but the

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:46.219
reality is that God has given us a perfect preserved book and in this book He has communicated

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:53.179
to His people what His expectations are of them and what our responsibilities are and

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:55.659
we must understand them.

00:13:55.659 --> 00:14:01.219
Ignorance is not a valid excuse and it does not eliminate our accountability.

00:14:01.219 --> 00:14:06.699
You're not going to stand before God and say, well I didn't know because God said I gave

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:08.379
you a Bible.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:14.619
I understand and I'm thankful that I've not had this experience, but I understand that

00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:19.619
if you have a driver's license that you are accountable if you decide to use that driver's

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:25.739
license to know the laws of the particular state in which you're driving.

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:33.099
And for you to say, I didn't know, is really not a valid excuse for a police officer or

00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:36.299
a judge if you took it to a court of law.

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:38.219
Ignorance is no excuse.

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:41.219
And so we must be informed, we must have the truth.

00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:47.419
Remember oftentimes you study the New Testament, the Apostle Paul will use this verbiage, I

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:50.779
would not have you be ignorant brethren.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:55.459
God wants His people to be informed, He's given us this precious book and here as we

00:14:55.459 --> 00:15:00.819
use this Old Testament passage of Scripture to bring forth and make some application in

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:08.259
our lives, these 300 men had to first understand what their responsibility was.

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:14.739
They never will fulfill their responsibility until they first understand their responsibility.

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:18.139
So we find as we look at the passage that they understood their responsibility.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:22.459
Number two, I believe they embraced their responsibility.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:29.219
I do not read verse number eight in such a way that Gideon had to tie these guys up to

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:36.299
keep them from leaving, that Gideon had some terrible job of trying to guilt them into

00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:37.299
doing.

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:41.619
But I believe they embraced this responsibility as it's been given to them.

00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:46.899
We find that the size of Gideon's army had been decreased significantly from 32,000 to

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:47.899
300.

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:55.259
We find that these now 300 men are there and when I talk about they embraced their responsibility,

00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:00.779
there was a willing acceptance of the assignment that had been given.

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:05.299
In verse number nine, the Bible says this, and it came to pass the same night that the

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:10.219
Lord said unto him, this is unto Gideon, arise, get thee down unto the host, for I

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:14.059
have delivered it into thine hand.

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:19.619
But look at verse number 10, if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant

00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:25.179
down to the host, and thou shalt hear what they say, and afterward shall thine hands

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:29.199
be strengthened to go down unto the host.

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:34.699
Then went he down with Purah the servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:36.499
the host.

00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:39.179
Now let me just pause here before I continue to read.

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:45.339
Understand that Gideon, when he's first approached by God, he is referred to as a mighty man

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:46.699
of valor.

00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:50.579
In chapter six and verse number 12, you'll read that, and Gideon's response in verse

00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:54.339
15 is, I am the least in my father's house.

00:16:54.339 --> 00:17:01.059
And God reveals to Gideon what his plan is to deliver his people from the Midianites,

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:05.659
but again, thinking back to last week, God's plan includes his people.

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:09.899
He's going to use Gideon to accomplish this.

00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:16.179
And Gideon is uncertain, and Gideon begins to, really his faith was kind of wavering,

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:17.179
if you will.

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:23.559
And so we find that God graciously gives to Gideon some faith builders.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:26.659
I'm thankful that our God knows our frame.

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:30.459
I'm thankful that he knows that we're but dust.

00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:35.139
And I'm thankful that he knows the struggles that we have, and God graciously, if you were

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:39.059
to read the sixth chapter, I don't have time to go back and to look at all of it, but we

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:49.279
find that the faith builders are given, and God graciously proves to Gideon that God will

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:55.739
indeed use Gideon to deliver his people from the Midianite oppression.

00:17:55.739 --> 00:18:00.919
But we find that even after three faith builders in chapter number six, that God still knows

00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:03.819
that Gideon needs a little bit more.

00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:09.899
See, God tells us that faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:15.419
We find that God today gives us, he's provided to us his word, and as he gives us his word,

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:21.519
as we feast upon his word, as we're in the Bible, that God will increase our faith.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:27.959
That God will help us to have that understanding that God is, and God is able, that he is able

00:18:27.959 --> 00:18:31.279
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:35.639
We find that the Bible tells us without faith, it's impossible to please him.

00:18:35.639 --> 00:18:41.039
And so if we understand the just shall live by faith, and we understand where faith comes

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:45.440
from from God's word, we need to have our faith increased.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.719
Gideon was in a place where he'd been given an assigned task, but he had to have his faith

00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:50.719
increased.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:57.679
And so here, God gives him his final faith builder, and you pick it back up in verse

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:03.079
number 12, and the Bible says that the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:07.599
the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude.

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:11.320
Their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.039
Remember, how many does Gideon have?

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:15.559
He's got 300.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.719
It says this in verse 13, and when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:26.679
a dream unto his fellow, and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:33.239
bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it, that it fell,

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:38.039
and overturned it, that the tent lay along.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:40.799
It's kind of an interesting dream.

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:45.099
And notice verse 14, and his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword

00:19:45.139 --> 00:19:46.139
of Gideon.

00:19:46.139 --> 00:19:48.139
Now, can you imagine Gideon?

00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:53.139
Remember, God said, Hey, if you're, in verse number 11, excuse me, in verse number 10,

00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:58.739
but if thou fear to go down, go and hear, verse number 11, what they say, and Gideon

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.939
and he goes down and he's there and he hears,

00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:02.639
he overhears this conversation

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.479
and the one fellow's telling his dream

00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:06.979
and the other fellow says this is nothing else

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:11.659
save the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash,

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:14.359
a man of Israel, for into his hand

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:18.499
hath God delivered Midian and all the host.

00:20:18.499 --> 00:20:21.059
Now that'll get you excited if you're Gideon.

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:24.099
You hear these guys talking, you're saying,

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.499
man, this is, what's God doing?

00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:27.099
God's building his faith.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:29.739
And in verse 15, it says, it was so

00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:31.939
when Gideon heard the telling of the dream

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:34.899
and the interpretation thereof, notice what he did.

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:38.579
Number one, he worshiped, he worshiped.

00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:42.979
I believe that Gideon was praising the Lord

00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:48.359
for what God graciously did in building his faith.

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:51.619
He stopped to worship.

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:54.019
You know, sometimes if we're not careful,

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.219
we can be too hurried in life

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.579
that we just don't stop to worship God.

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:03.899
Remember Psalm 46, be still and know that I'm God.

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:06.699
We have busy schedules, we have busy lives,

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:07.619
we're running all over the place,

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:09.099
got all sorts of things going on,

00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:14.099
but we find that Gideon, he stops and he worships.

00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:18.139
But then notice it says that he returned

00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:23.139
into the host of Israel and said, arise,

00:21:23.219 --> 00:21:26.499
for the Lord hath delivered into your hand

00:21:26.499 --> 00:21:28.979
the host of Midian.

00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:31.859
Who's he speaking to?

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.859
He's speaking to the 300 men.

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.899
The Bible tells us in verse 16,

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:39.179
and he divided the 300 men into three companies.

00:21:39.179 --> 00:21:42.099
So I find that as we look at this portion of scripture

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:45.259
and we see how God increased the faith of Gideon,

00:21:45.259 --> 00:21:48.019
but then we focus back on these 300 men

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:49.739
that understood their responsibility,

00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:53.179
but now they're embracing this responsibility

00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:55.779
that they've been given, they rise up.

00:21:55.779 --> 00:22:00.179
We find that Gideon says in verse number 15, arise, why?

00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:02.299
For the Lord hath delivered into your hand

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:05.459
the host of Midian, and he divided the 300 men.

00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:08.819
It's my understanding as you go from verse 15 to 16

00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:10.979
that what those men did is they rose up

00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:12.739
as they'd been instructed to do so,

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:14.819
and they were divided into companies

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:18.179
and they were embracing the responsibility.

00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.859
There was a willing acceptance on their part

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:25.099
for the assignment, for the responsibility

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:27.059
that was given to them.

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:28.859
This evening, it's not simply enough

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:31.639
to understand responsibility.

00:22:31.639 --> 00:22:33.819
We must embrace the responsibility.

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:38.179
I believe this evening that it's absolutely imperative

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:41.099
that we understand, but it's not enough.

00:22:42.659 --> 00:22:45.939
As we embrace our biblical responsibility,

00:22:45.939 --> 00:22:49.179
we find that this is going to take us

00:22:49.179 --> 00:22:53.139
to a place of ultimately, in our final point,

00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:56.099
fulfilling the responsibility.

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:58.279
We find they understood, they embraced,

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:02.059
but number three, they fulfilled their responsibility.

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:04.899
Without understanding, I said this,

00:23:04.899 --> 00:23:08.379
and it's quite basic truth,

00:23:08.379 --> 00:23:10.899
that you will not fulfill a responsibility

00:23:10.899 --> 00:23:13.339
that you do not know about.

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:14.899
So they first had to understand,

00:23:14.899 --> 00:23:16.739
it had to be communicated to them.

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:19.819
They then embrace it, they are all in,

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:22.819
they're surrendered, they're yielded, they're willing.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:25.599
We find that they then fulfill their responsibility.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:28.619
Notice the final instruction, these final details

00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:31.699
that are provided to these 300 men in verse 16.

00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:33.419
It says that he, speaking of Gideon,

00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:36.619
divided the 300 men into three companies.

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:39.659
He put a trumpet in every man's hand

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:44.039
with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers.

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:46.879
And he said unto them, look on me and do likewise,

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:50.079
and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp,

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:55.079
it shall be that as I do, so shall ye do.

00:23:56.639 --> 00:24:00.479
When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me,

00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:03.279
then blow ye the trumpets also on every side

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.839
of all the camp and say,

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:09.279
the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:12.799
So, verse 19, Gideon and the hundred men

00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:15.359
that were with him came unto the outside of the camp

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:17.039
in the beginning of the middle watch,

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.559
and they had but newly set the watch

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:20.440
beginning of the many nights,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.239
and they blew the trumpets and break the pitchers

00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:27.479
that were in their hands.

00:24:27.479 --> 00:24:29.679
The three companies blew the trumpets

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:32.079
and break the pitchers and held the lamps

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:35.199
in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands

00:24:35.199 --> 00:24:38.039
to blow with all, and they cried,

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:41.359
the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.639
We find that they did, as they were told,

00:24:45.639 --> 00:24:49.319
they followed the instruction that had been provided,

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:51.479
and we come to verse 21,

00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:53.919
the phrase that we've used for the title

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:55.239
of the message this evening,

00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:56.079
and the Bible says,

00:24:56.079 --> 00:25:01.079
and they stood every man in his place

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:02.759
round about the camp,

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:06.839
and all the hosts ran and cried and fled.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:11.039
And I want you to see here as we understand

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:13.160
that every man is in his place,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.399
that all 300 fulfilled the responsibility

00:25:17.399 --> 00:25:19.079
that was given to them.

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:21.880
Ultimately, it's God who gave the victory.

00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:25.079
We understand even from the beginning

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.440
of reading chapter number seven

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.039
that God made it abundantly clear

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:31.000
that your army is too large

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.160
because if I give you victory with this size of an army,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.639
you'll take credit yourself,

00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:37.839
so I'm gonna dwindle the size of the army down

00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:39.679
so that you understand I'm the one

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.079
that gives the victory.

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:44.639
We find that the tactics that are explained here,

00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:46.679
this is not military strategy

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:49.479
that you'd try to employ today in some battle,

00:25:49.479 --> 00:25:53.079
sitting around the desk as you're preparing for battle,

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:53.919
and say, you know, guys,

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:54.979
I think we should take pictures,

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:56.239
and we should take trumpets,

00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:57.079
and they're gonna say,

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:59.000
who are you and where did you come from?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.599
This is not the battle plan

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:02.959
that we're putting into place.

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:04.199
But this is from God.

00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:07.779
And Gideon accepts what God says,

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:09.279
and Gideon communicates,

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:11.919
and these 300 men,

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:14.559
they simply obey.

00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:17.119
They simply fulfill

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:21.799
what had been assigned to them to do.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:24.199
They fulfill their responsibility.

00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:25.799
See, every man in this place,

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:27.839
I begin to think about what's taking place here

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:29.319
in this text of scripture.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:32.440
It says, round about the camp.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.359
And in your mind's eye,

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:35.119
if you can think about these Midianites,

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:37.279
and you think about their host,

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.799
and this large company of people,

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:41.479
the number's not provided to us.

00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:43.799
It simply tells us in this chapter

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:47.399
that they're like grasshoppers for multitude.

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:48.979
We find it in chapter number six.

00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:50.880
It just simply says, without number.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.799
And we come here,

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:54.599
and we see there's this great host that's there,

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.440
that's camped,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.019
and God instructs Gideon to have these 300 men

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:01.220
go around the camp.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.660
And as they do what God had instructed them to do,

00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:08.779
as they blow their trumpets,

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:10.019
and break the pitchers,

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:12.239
and held the lamps in their left hands,

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:13.679
and the trumpets in their right hands,

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.819
and they blow the trumpets,

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:17.859
and they cry the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:20.019
When these Midianites hear this,

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:22.220
when they begin to see what's taking place,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.419
I want you in your mind's eye to understand

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:27.259
that in any direction that they look,

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:32.440
they only see these 300 men that are in their place.

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:35.979
If there were some that decided,

00:27:35.979 --> 00:27:38.299
I don't like the place that was assigned to me,

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:40.500
why are those 100 going over there,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.339
and we have to go over here?

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:44.279
I'd rather go over there.

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:46.099
That looks like a better place.

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.419
You know, I don't want to stand next to them.

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:49.339
Why, I don't,

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:51.819
I'm being a little fastidious,

00:27:51.819 --> 00:27:53.579
but you understand what I'm saying.

00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:57.419
There seems to be, as you look at the text of Scripture,

00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:00.859
that there's no break as they circled the city,

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:03.459
as they put themselves around the city.

00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:04.979
There's no break point,

00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:08.660
there's no exit pathway for the Midianites

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.019
to see that there's a large gap

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:15.139
at the northwest corner of our camp

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:16.380
that we can escape out of.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.380
No, any direction that they look,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.859
they see the same thing.

00:28:19.859 --> 00:28:22.099
They don't know that there's only 300.

00:28:22.099 --> 00:28:24.299
They don't know what's behind them.

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:26.940
They just see that, and the Bible tells us,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.859
of course, God causes great confusion for the Midianites,

00:28:30.859 --> 00:28:34.059
and it says that all the host at the end of verse number 21

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:36.099
ran and cried and fled,

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.059
and the 300 blew the trumpets,

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:41.219
and the Lord sent every man's sword against his fellow,

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.779
even throughout all the host,

00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:44.820
and the host fled to Bethshetta,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.020
at Zarephath and to the border,

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.979
and you begin to see what's taking place

00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:51.940
in this victory that God would give,

00:28:52.779 --> 00:28:56.260
and you find how that they are in their place.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.099
They're where they're supposed to be,

00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:01.859
and because of that, as you continue to read

00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:03.179
the end of chapter seven,

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:05.219
and as you go into chapter number eight,

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:07.940
you find that God wrought a great victory

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.020
for the children of Israel,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.140
but they're in their place.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:17.140
Why do we make such focus on that statement?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.940
Every man in his place, because every man has a place.

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:25.339
Every one of us have a responsibility, personally,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.459
and we need to know what our place is

00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:33.059
before we could ever be in our place.

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:36.539
Gideon communicated for this particular passage

00:29:36.539 --> 00:29:38.940
of Scripture, and this particular historical event

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.179
for the children of Israel,

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:41.779
the assignment had been given.

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:44.099
They knew exactly where they were supposed to be,

00:29:44.459 --> 00:29:46.459
and that was their place,

00:29:46.459 --> 00:29:48.779
and they had to embrace that so that they

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.500
could fulfill what God wanted them to do

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.020
with their lives in this particular situation,

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.140
but to begin to make action in their lives

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.339
is a very terrible thing,

00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:00.320
but that interpretation,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.500
if anybody does something in their life,

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.739
and then God will secure it,

00:30:03.739 --> 00:30:05.899
and that's another thing about it.

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:08.219
So I think that and from that,

00:30:08.219 --> 00:30:11.140
the benevolent, righteous, thankful people

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.220
application for us as New Testament believers and to begin to understand that God has a

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.220
place for us.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.900
That is a place for us.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.580
I think it's worded this way in the junior church decorations, a spot for you.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.220
And the reality is that God has a place for each and every one of His people.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.580
If you're saved by the grace of God this evening, you've been enlisted into the Lord's army.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.380
You have a responsibility to live for Christ, to bring honor and glory to His name, to be

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.060
His representative, to be His ambassador.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.380
What a great responsibility.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:50.180
And again, we cannot take and just say, no, I don't want to hear what my responsibility

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.180
is.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.180
We're accountable for it.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.180
I shared the story years ago.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.160
Turn to 2 Corinthians 5, and as you're turning there, I shared this story years ago.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:03.880
There was a dear lady that was in the church that we attended right after Bible college.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.820
And she was a sweet senior saint of the Lord, serving the nursery ministry faithfully.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.420
And just a sweet lady, and her husband never came to church.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.820
Her husband used to come to church.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.920
Her husband attended faithfully for a number of years, and that was prior to us ever coming

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920
to that church.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.620
And we just never knew really what the circumstances were with regard to why he stopped coming

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.700
to church and whatever was taking place.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.980
And there was one particular week that the pastor of our church assigned for Holly and

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.180
I to make a visit to this family and try to talk to this man.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.780
And I remember going there, and of course, we had a great relationship with the wife,

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.960
and she served in the nursery.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.900
We had little kids at the time, and so she was always taking such good care of our kids

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.900
in the nursery.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.580
And we had built a pretty good rapport with her, but we're sitting there and having this

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.580
conversation.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.500
And as Holly was communicating with the wife, I sat in the living room and I was having

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.860
a conversation with the husband.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.540
It's just a real basic conversation to start out with, and obviously, I was looking for

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.420
opportunity to get the conversation to spiritual matters and try to understand what was going

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.420
on.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.380
And after just a short period of time of communicating, he looked at me with all sincerity and he

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:23.220
said this, I stopped coming to church because I don't want to be responsible for that stuff.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.220
I don't want to be…

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:30.100
Here's what he said to me, I understand that what I hear, I'm accountable for.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.180
And so if I don't hear it, then I'm not accountable.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.500
And I was about 23 years old.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:41.180
I was real young, and if you're in that age range, you're real young.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.540
But I was about 23 years old, and no one ever taught me what to say when somebody says that

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.540
to you in Bible college.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.060
You know, they don't tell you that kind of stuff.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.580
And so I'm sitting there, and I'm trying to…

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.340
And I'm just praying, and I'm trying to think about what I say to this man.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.540
And I said, and this guy, I mean, they were probably in their 70s.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.980
I mean, he was much my senior.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:07.440
And I looked at him with as much humility as I could possibly have, and I said, sir,

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.180
with all due respect, you're accountable whether you come and hear it or not.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.180
You're accountable.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.940
You're going to stand before God one day.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:23.220
And for you to make yourself feel better by staying home and saying I'm not hearing it

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:29.220
and therefore I'm not accountable to it, you've really just deceived yourself.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.820
I wish I could tell you that that man started coming to church after that, but I don't think

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.060
I ever saw him come to church one time the entire time that we served in that ministry.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.280
It was a very sad situation.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280
This evening, we're accountable.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280
We're responsible.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.860
God's given us a task.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.180
He's given us a responsibility.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.660
He says it very plainly in the book of Mark, are you into all the world and preach the

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.900
gospel to every creature.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:59.700
And I want you to look in closing this evening at 2 Corinthians chapter 5, and I want you

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:05.340
to understand this evening that the task that's been assigned to us is obviously quite different

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.100
than the task that we read of in Judges chapter number 7.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:17.200
The task that's been given to us is a task to take a message of hope and of peace and

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.140
of joy to a people that are lost and dying and on their way to a Christless eternity

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.080
in the place called hell or the lake of fire.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.560
It's a task that's been assigned to us as His representatives, as His ambassadors.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.280
And we have this glorious message, I mean the greatest message, the gospel literally

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.400
the good news.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.440
The greatest message that could ever be spoken is the message that's been entrusted to us.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:54.120
And we do not go as the ambassadors or the representatives of Christ seeking to fulfill

00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:01.840
this responsibility that He has given to us so that we could earn God's favor.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.560
God loves me.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560
God loves you.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.880
That's just a settled truth of God's Word, He loves you.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:15.440
And we find that we are not seeking to go and fulfill this task so that we could earn

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.280
God's love or God's favor.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.120
It's not so that we could earn heaven.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.560
You cannot earn heaven.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.560
Heaven is a gift.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.560
Eternal life is a gift.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:33.620
We find that it's God's love for us that really compels us to do what He's called us to do.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:40.140
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture, that we find that as God would

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.740
give us this task, that it's our love for Him, understanding that we have been saved

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.060
by the grace of God.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.580
If someone had not given to me, if someone had not given to you this glorious message

00:35:53.580 --> 00:36:02.220
of the gospel, we too would be on a path to eternal damnation in the place called the

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.060
lake of fire.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:11.380
But thank God that somebody was willing to embrace their responsibility and fulfill their

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.380
responsibility so that we might receive the gospel.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.200
We find that as we come to 2 Corinthians 5, again, you cannot earn salvation.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.440
You cannot work to keep your salvation.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.020
We are kept by the power of God.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020
Praise the Lord.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.740
I know I've said this before from the pulpit, but if I could lose my salvation, I'd have

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.100
lost it right after I got it.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.100
And I would submit to you that you would have as well.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.860
You say, well, I would have made it more minutes than you.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.380
You still would have lost it, amen?

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.140
I'm serious.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.220
But thank God we can't lose our salvation.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.500
I didn't do anything to earn it.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.820
It's all by the grace of God and I'm kept by His power.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:56.740
So it's not a matter of going to heaven as you look at this, but it's because we understand

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.060
what we've been given and the fact that we get to be His representatives.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:08.820
Notice in verse 14, for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:14.340
if one died for all, then we're all dead.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:22.180
And that He, speaking of Christ, died for all, that we which live should not henceforth

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:31.260
live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and rose again.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:41.580
You know, the truth of verse 15 is a truth that is powerful, life-altering truth.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:50.140
Too many people, generally speaking, but even too many of God's people are living for themselves.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.300
They're just living for themselves.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.300
What can I get?

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.380
What's going to make my life happy?

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.380
It's the here and now.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.980
It's what the tangible, what can I, the temporal.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.140
But God calls us to a different kind of living.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:10.180
He calls us to live with a focus not on the temporal or the temporary, but He calls us

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.940
to live on a focus on the eternal.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.500
And He continues in the passage and says, wherefore henceforth know we no man after

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.700
the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700
Him no more.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.180
Therefore, verse 17, what a powerful verse of scripture, if any man be in Christ, he's

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.420
a new creature, old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.620
What a glorious truth.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:41.500
The power of the gospel to transform people's lives.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.660
It's not reformation.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.940
It's not just going through some step program and just trying to make your, I'm going to

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.540
be a better me.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.900
No, the gospel is transforming.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.780
We are a new creature in Christ.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.859
We have a new identity.

00:38:57.859 --> 00:38:58.900
We've been made alive.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.619
We were dead in our trespasses and our sins, but we've been made alive.

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:08.780
We've been quickened by the grace of God.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:16.080
Verse 18, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.080
What a joy to know that you've been reconciled.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.640
Two parties that are at variance, reconciled, why?

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.600
Jesus Christ reconciled.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.720
I couldn't reconcile.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.280
I was guilty and so were you.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:38.679
The sin of humanity is what put us at variance, but Jesus Christ said, I will pay for that

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:42.600
sin so that we might be reconciled.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.160
It says this, that all things are of God, verse 18, who hath reconciled us to Himself

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160
by Jesus Christ.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.280
And this evening, if you're saved by the blood of Christ, you've been reconciled to God through

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.880
salvation.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:03.280
But notice it says, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.760
So he's now entrusted us with this ministry of reconciliation.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.799
It's interesting in chapter number four of the book of 2 Corinthians, he says this in

00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:14.879
Number one, therefore, seeing we have this ministry,

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:17.479
as we have received mercy, we faint not.

00:40:17.479 --> 00:40:20.479
We find that God has given to us,

00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:23.239
as we look throughout the pages of this book

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:25.319
of 2 Corinthians, this ministry.

00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:26.679
Here in chapter number five,

00:40:26.679 --> 00:40:29.399
speaking about the ministry of reconciliation,

00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:31.839
and I'm thankful that God enables us,

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:36.359
and we do not have to faint to lose heart,

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:39.799
to not know we can be renewed in our inner man,

00:40:39.799 --> 00:40:42.319
according to verse 16 of chapter four.

00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:45.439
But notice, as we consider this ministry

00:40:45.439 --> 00:40:48.919
that God has given to us, he says in chapter number four,

00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:50.959
that if our gospel be hidden, it is hidden

00:40:50.959 --> 00:40:52.519
to them that are lost.

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:54.559
He tells us that in whom the God of this world

00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:56.719
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:58.759
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

00:40:58.759 --> 00:41:02.019
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:05.259
There is a spiritual battle that's taking place.

00:41:05.259 --> 00:41:06.919
The God of this world, Satan,

00:41:06.919 --> 00:41:09.999
hath blinded the minds of them that believe not.

00:41:09.999 --> 00:41:10.839
Why?

00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:12.639
Because he wants them to stay lost.

00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:14.599
He doesn't want them to be saved.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:16.359
And then we find that the Bible tells us

00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:19.439
that we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus, the Lord.

00:41:19.439 --> 00:41:21.079
He tells us in verse number seven

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:23.999
that we have this treasure in earth and vessels,

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:26.519
that the excellency of the power may be of God,

00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:28.259
and not of us.

00:41:28.259 --> 00:41:31.799
Back to chapter five, he says that we've been given

00:41:31.799 --> 00:41:34.319
this ministry of reconciliation at the end of verse 18,

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:37.359
and verse 19, to wit, that God was in Christ

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:39.639
reconciling the world unto himself,

00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:42.119
not imputing their trespasses unto them,

00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:46.999
and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:51.999
Now, verse 20, now then, we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:58.019
As though God did beseech you by us,

00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:03.019
we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:05.879
Ambassadors.

00:42:07.479 --> 00:42:10.359
Ambassadors, representatives.

00:42:10.359 --> 00:42:12.699
You have an ambassador from the United States

00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.959
that goes to another country.

00:42:14.959 --> 00:42:18.919
They have one duty, to represent the U.S.

00:42:18.919 --> 00:42:21.559
in whatever territory, whatever country it is that they go,

00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:24.939
they're to represent the United States of America

00:42:24.939 --> 00:42:27.379
in that territory, in that country.

00:42:28.439 --> 00:42:30.319
I said this at the beginning of the service,

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:32.399
not part of the message, but at the beginning of the service,

00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:35.119
this world is not my home, I'm just passing through.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.479
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,

00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:37.739
and if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:39.519
you're a pilgrim and a stranger too,

00:42:39.519 --> 00:42:42.839
you're heaven bound, our citizenship is in heaven,

00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:45.599
but God has left us here on this earth,

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:48.879
we happen to be physically in the United States of America,

00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:51.919
as his ambassadors.

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:53.659
So what is it that we're representing?

00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:57.039
We're representing his kingdom, we're preaching his gospel,

00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:01.479
we're given this ministry of reconciliation.

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:03.959
If we do not understand the responsibility

00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:05.439
that has been assigned to us,

00:43:05.439 --> 00:43:07.559
there's no possibility that we're ever going

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:12.399
to embrace it, yet fulfill it.

00:43:12.399 --> 00:43:15.799
And so we must understand the responsibility,

00:43:15.799 --> 00:43:19.359
and then we embrace that responsibility and say,

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:23.839
God would use us to be his representatives.

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:28.559
God would use us to tell someone else

00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:30.959
how they too could go to heaven.

00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:35.479
It's absolutely amazing that God would use us.

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:39.039
Thinking about all of the possible things

00:43:39.039 --> 00:43:44.039
that God could have done, he could have used angels,

00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:46.719
he could have, you start filling in the blanks

00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:51.719
of what he could, but he decided to use us.

00:43:52.279 --> 00:43:54.559
And the question tonight,

00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:58.079
how are we doing fulfilling the responsibility?

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:00.159
As we looked at the passage of Scripture

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:04.199
in the book of Judges, the Bible says every man

00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:09.199
in his place, understanding that God has a place for us.

00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:16.679
And how are we doing fulfilling the responsibility

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:18.559
that God has given to us?

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:19.919
Have we embraced it?

00:44:20.919 --> 00:44:23.079
Have we ignored it?

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:27.039
Have we fill in the blank?

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:28.759
But how are we doing?

00:44:28.759 --> 00:44:30.959
Because God has given us a responsibility.

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:34.839
And we must recognize this evening that yes,

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:37.279
ultimately to bring honor and glory to God,

00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:39.000
and we can do that in a variety of ways,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.799
but according very clearly to John 15,

00:44:41.799 --> 00:44:45.039
when we bear fruit, it brings glory to God.

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.839
Very plainly and very clearly.

00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:52.000
And so this evening, every man in his place,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.879
I wonder tonight, as we would take just a few moments

00:44:54.919 --> 00:44:59.319
to examine ourselves, have a time of invitation,

00:44:59.319 --> 00:45:00.879
if we truly allow the Spirit of God

00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:03.159
to work in our hearts and our lives,

00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:07.799
to really evaluate how we're doing in this area

00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:10.159
of the ministry that God has given to us.

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:12.679
Because he left us here for a purpose,

00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:14.519
and he left us here to be his ambassadors,

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:17.359
his representatives, and there are lost people

00:45:19.479 --> 00:45:22.959
that potentially only you will come in contact with,

00:45:23.959 --> 00:45:26.000
that God will give you the opportunity

00:45:26.959 --> 00:45:29.919
to share with them the glorious gospel.

00:45:29.919 --> 00:45:33.399
It may not be that your preacher ever has the opportunity

00:45:33.399 --> 00:45:36.199
to meet them or talk with them.

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:38.559
It may simply be that you are the one

00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:41.399
that God has placed in their lives,

00:45:41.399 --> 00:45:44.799
and he's given to you the ministry of reconciliation.

00:45:44.799 --> 00:45:45.639
Let's pray.

00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:46.599
Father, we love you.

00:45:46.599 --> 00:45:47.720
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.720
We thank you for the account in the book of Judges,

00:45:53.879 --> 00:45:58.159
having the opportunity to see that passage and that event

00:45:58.159 --> 00:46:02.720
and to understand those 300 men

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.599
and their fulfillment of their responsibility

00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:07.879
that had been given to them.

00:46:07.879 --> 00:46:09.799
Every man was in his place.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.599
God, as we seek to, from that passage of Scripture,

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:15.479
make application in our own lives

00:46:15.479 --> 00:46:18.119
with regard to the ministry that you've given to us

00:46:18.119 --> 00:46:21.559
and the call that you've placed upon our lives,

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:25.759
for every child of God, anyone that's a new creature,

00:46:25.759 --> 00:46:27.399
anyone that's saved by the grace of God,

00:46:27.399 --> 00:46:29.519
that we are your ambassadors,

00:46:30.399 --> 00:46:31.839
that you have committed to us

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:34.639
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:39.519
You've promised to go with us, to be with us.

00:46:39.519 --> 00:46:42.159
You've promised that your word will not return void.

00:46:42.159 --> 00:46:44.799
You promised that your word will accomplish.

00:46:44.799 --> 00:46:47.639
You promised that your word is powerful,

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:51.199
and the gospel is the power of God

00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:53.639
unto salvation to everyone that believeth.

00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:57.599
God, I pray tonight, in these few moments of invitation,

00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:01.559
that you'd help us to evaluate our lives.

00:47:01.559 --> 00:47:05.919
Lord, that you would help us to be yielded and surrendered.

00:47:05.919 --> 00:47:09.159
Help us to not only understand and embrace,

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:12.440
but Lord, help us to fulfill the responsibility

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.119
that you have given to us.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.039
We'll thank you for it.

00:47:16.039 --> 00:47:17.119
In Christ's name, we pray.

00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:18.720
Would you stand with me?

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.759
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:19.759 --> 00:47:21.319
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

00:47:21.319 --> 00:47:23.239
and as she does, the altar is open.
