1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
on chapter number two, and we're looking at verses one and two today.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,720
And the title for the message, if you look at the back of the bulletin, Jesus, Our Advocate.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,800
And we'll get to that great truth here in just a few moments and what precious truth

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
it is.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,319
I want you to notice as we begin looking at this passage of Scripture, the Bible says,

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:23,319
my little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,000
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,360
And he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
the whole world.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
As we begin this passage of Scripture, you'll know it's a very interesting introduction,

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,240
if you will, a greeting, the verbiage in which is used in verse number one, my little children.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,479
I do not believe that this phrase, this greeting would be one of insult, rather one of encouragement.

13
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:02,080
We find that at the time of the writing of the book of 1 John, this epistle, we understand

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,279
that John is the last of the apostles that is still living.

15
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:13,599
He's an old man by this particular time, and we find that the enemy has been at work.

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:19,279
The false teachers have infiltrated into the churches, and John is being used of the Lord

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,519
to provide instruction.

18
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,199
And when he uses this phraseology, my little children, really he's communicating to these

19
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:33,360
believers not only his care and his concern for them, but his love for them.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,839
And you think about the communication of this greeting, my little children, understanding

21
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:46,319
that at salvation we're born again, and you'd understand the truth of being babes in Christ

22
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,599
and thinking about this phraseology of these that are younger in their faith than what

23
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,919
the apostle John would be.

24
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,360
He's of course walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,199
He testifies in the opening statements of 1 John chapter number one that he is an eyewitness

26
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:06,040
of these things, and he provides this eyewitness account.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,679
We find that he says that his ears have heard, his eyes have seen, his hands have handled

28
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:18,039
of the word of life, and he provides this great record, and as he's speaking to these

29
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:24,600
that are younger in their faith, my little children, he is encouraging them, and he's

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,080
communicating to them his great love and care and concern for them.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,839
We find it's also of note, we've mentioned in our previous messages, that in verse number

32
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:39,800
three, and again in verse number five, you read the phrase, declare unto you.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,839
In verse number three it says, that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,

34
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:49,320
and in verse number five of chapter number one it says, this then is the message which

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,800
we have heard of him and declare unto you.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,960
And so we've noted the fact that John is a faithful messenger.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,940
He has faithfully, is faithfully communicating that which he has been instructed to communicate.

38
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,800
We also find that it's interesting that here in verse number one of chapter two, there's

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,119
a phrase that was mentioned in verse number four.

40
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,039
That phrase is this, write unto you.

41
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:22,000
Notice in verse number four, and these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,039
In verse number one of first John chapter number two, he says, my little children, notice,

43
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,360
these things write I unto you.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,679
We'll see it again in chapter number five, but we find that John is communicating the

45
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:40,839
word of God to the people of God, and as he's communicating to them, no doubt the

46
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:45,919
truth that is being communicated is powerful, life-changing truth.

47
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm so thankful for the word of God and the power that it has to change lives, and I'm

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
thankful for the way in which our last message in verses five through 10 of first John one,

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,520
the truth that was revealed there in that passage, really we begin to see in verse one

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,960
and two of chapter number two how that truth is played out, how it applies practically

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,119
in our lives.

52
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:13,880
If you're taking notes this morning, I only have two points, but don't get excited.

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,100
They're two very long points, amen?

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,399
And so bear with me on the two points this morning.

55
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,920
Number one, if you're taking notes, an appeal to the believer.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,320
An appeal to the believer.

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,760
I want you to notice, he says, my little children, in verse number one of chapter two, these

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,839
things write I unto you, notice this appeal, that ye sin not.

59
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,200
Wow.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,239
What an appeal to the child of God, to the believer.

61
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:45,279
We've stated in previous messages, in fact, I mentioned it last week, and we find that

62
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:51,239
the text before us in verses five through 10 of chapter number one clearly teaches us

63
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:56,760
that we will never reach a place of sinless perfection in this mortal body.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,119
One day, one glorious day, this mortal, this corruption shall put on incorruption and this

65
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:08,480
mortal shall put on immortality, and we understand that we will no longer have this flesh, but

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,160
while we walk upon this earth and we have this mortal body, we have the flesh.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,679
So we will not reach a place of sinless perfection, however, the appeal to the believer is here

68
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,679
that ye sin not.

69
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Now think about that and understand with me, I would say it this way, that it's not a truth

70
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,000
of reaching a place of sinless perfection, but the reality is that as the people of God,

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,720
I should sin less as I walk with Him.

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,239
Amen?

73
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:47,040
As we grow in our walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, as we walk in the light, as He is

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,959
in the light, I ought to be sinning less and less as I'm in His presence.

75
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,679
Have you ever been driving down the highway?

76
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:58,959
I've spent many hours on the highway in recent days, and it's always interesting when you

77
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,320
pass one of those individuals that's sitting in the median upon the highway and all of

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,679
a sudden everyone feels the need, they are compelled to follow the speed limit.

79
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:13,760
The guys that were passing by you and changing lanes and driving erratically, all of a sudden

80
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,299
they see the presence of a law enforcement and they decide they ought to get things contained

81
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,940
and follow the law.

82
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,220
The reality is that when we understand that we're walking in the light as He is in the

83
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,619
light, we're having fellowship with Him, and we're living daily in the presence of God,

84
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,220
it ought to impact our behavior.

85
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,420
Amen?

86
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:43,200
It ought not be that we live and just casually sin and just go through this process as a

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,260
believer freely sinning.

88
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:52,160
In fact, I believe this morning that the enemy, our enemy, has twisted two very powerful

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,959
biblical truths that greatly hinder the effectiveness of God's people today.

90
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,320
Here's what those two truths are, I believe, and we see it here as he says that ye sin

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
not.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,359
First of all, I would say this, the enemy, our enemy, Satan, has taken a wonderful Bible

93
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:16,940
truth and he's twisted it, and I believe that it hinders our effectiveness, the first

94
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,700
of which is the grace of God.

95
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:28,140
The Bible tells us in Jude 4, and just a few pages over from 1 John, it's a short letter,

96
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,140
only 25 verses here in the book of Jude, but you find that the Bible tells us in Jude 4,

97
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:41,040
for there were certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation,

98
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,519
ungodly men, notice what the Bible says, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and

99
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,079
denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

100
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,559
I am so thankful for the grace of God, aren't you?

101
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,200
We sing about His amazing grace.

102
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,359
We understand that His grace is amazing, it is abundant, and I'm thankful that I'm saved

103
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,859
by His grace, that I'm able to serve by His grace.

104
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm thankful, the truth that God has given us in His Word with regard to His grace, but

105
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:22,179
you see here that the Bible says that they've turned the grace of our God into lasciviousness.

106
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,820
That word lasciviousness is not a word that's very commonly used today, but it's a word

107
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,220
that means unbridled lust.

108
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,039
It's a word that carries with it the idea of just doing whatever it is that you want

109
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
to do.

110
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,400
We've turned, they, the enemy, has twisted the truth of the grace of God, and here we

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,479
find that it says in Jude 4 that they've turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

112
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,479
Think about this truth.

113
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:53,760
Go over to Romans 5 if you will, and look at this passage and how it's dealt with in

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,640
Romans 5, the last portion of the, really the last verse and into the sixth chapter

115
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,020
of Romans 5 and into verse chapter number 6.

116
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,039
Notice Romans 5 in verse number 21.

117
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:12,479
Notice what it said, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through

118
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:18,719
righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

119
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:24,400
So there's this contrast that's being made in the fifth chapter about the sin and the

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,640
entry of sin and the effect of sin, but then the contrast made with the gift of God and

121
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,719
the life that God gives through His Son and the crucifixion on the cross of Calvary and

122
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:44,679
how that all men are affected by the sin of Adam and were all sinners, but because of

123
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:51,640
the death of Jesus Christ, that righteousness now is available to all men, and what a joy

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,239
that we find in this portion of Scripture.

125
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:58,359
But notice what is said in the beginning of chapter number 6 and verse number 1.

126
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,000
What shall we say then?

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,400
When we consider this sin versus the grace of God, what shall we say then?

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:15,680
Notice what it says, shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,139
So I know that God is gracious.

130
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,879
The enemy has twisted this powerful Bible truth that God is gracious.

131
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,319
He's turned it into lasciviousness, this unbridled lust.

132
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:34,319
God is gracious and it's deemed our effectiveness, it has hindered our effectiveness.

133
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:39,319
It's really deemed us to be ineffective because we believe the lie of the enemy.

134
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,840
Well God is gracious.

135
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Should we say that we should continue in sin that grace may abound?

136
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,200
What's the answer?

137
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
God forbid.

138
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,000
God forbid.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,540
How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?

140
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,680
The idea is not that, well, I want to experience the grace of God so I'm going to go out and

141
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,839
live all this sin so that I can experience the grace of God.

142
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,839
That's not the idea.

143
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,839
But there are people today that have twisted the idea of God's grace and it renders us

144
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,599
ineffective because God does not use dirty vessels, amen?

145
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:28,160
And we find that it's rendered us ineffective and the enemy has been very just subtle in

146
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,959
his approach and his attack.

147
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,800
And I would say that not only the truth of the grace of God, but really contextually

148
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,639
with what we look at in 1 John, back in 1 John I would say this, the forgiveness of

149
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,639
God.

150
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,699
Aren't you thankful for God's forgiveness?

151
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm thankful that he is faithful and just.

152
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Amen?

153
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Aren't you?

154
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,559
Aren't you thankful that with him there is forgiveness, that he is ready to pardon, he

155
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,919
is ready to forgive?

156
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,319
I'm so thankful for that truth.

157
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:05,720
But the reality is that there are people today, the enemy has peddled this idea and twisted

158
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,000
the truth of not only the grace of God, but the forgiveness of God, that it almost gives

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,600
the believer when they've been affected and impacted by this wrong teaching, that it gives

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,839
them this free car, get out of jail free kind of an idea that I can go and sin and

161
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,539
live however I want to live because God's going to forgive me.

162
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,119
And it renders us ineffective.

163
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,660
In 1 John 1 and verse number 9 is a powerful truth, we looked at it last week, if we confess

164
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,839
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

165
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,080
But when we find here that we understand this truth, it's not so that we just go out and

166
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,639
sin and live however we want to live and say, well, God is gracious and he's going to forgive

167
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,559
and so I can just do what I want to do.

168
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:04,919
Look at the appeal in verse number 1 of 1 John 2, after the instruction is given in

169
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,600
the first chapter with regard to the fellowship and what have you, we find that he says, my

170
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,839
little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not.

171
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,919
It's not the mentality that God is gracious and that God will forgive and therefore I

172
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,759
have this license and I can go do whatever I want to do and then I know I can just confess

173
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,160
it and he'll forgive me.

174
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,080
That's a wrong theology.

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,119
That is a bad hermeneutic.

176
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:40,880
The reality is that the truth of God's grace and the truth of God's forgiveness ought to

177
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,199
bring us to the place when we understand all that he's done for us and we understand all

178
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,440
that he is to us, that we say, I want to sin less and less and less.

179
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,119
Getting to the point, again, we're never going to reach that place of sinless perfection,

180
00:13:56,119 --> 00:14:01,600
but when we look and evaluate our lives, we say, I sin less today than I sinned yesterday.

181
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Amen?

182
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Why?

183
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Because I'm walking in the light.

184
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,839
I'm walking in his presence.

185
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,119
The question, see the reality is this, the believer should not sin freely because of

186
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,679
these great Bible truths.

187
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:25,040
No, rather the believer should strive, should make it their goal that they sin not.

188
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,559
Amen?

189
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,160
Seems as if at times we get so influenced by our culture.

190
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,279
The church has always been called to influence the culture, but we find that there's always

191
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,600
been an influence from the culture upon the church.

192
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,000
There are times in which our sin is justified and excused and made light of.

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Everyone does it.

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,760
It's just the acceptable thing.

195
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,040
But the reality is that as I'm walking in the light and I'm walking with Christ, the

196
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:05,320
appeal to the child of God, the appeal to the believer in 1 John 2 is that we sin not.

197
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,519
Can I sin less?

198
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,559
Is it even possible?

199
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,920
If so, how?

200
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,720
I would say three very quick things this morning on answering the question when the appeal

201
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,519
is that you sin not, I would say this, yes, indeed, I can sin less as I walk with Christ.

202
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,040
And one way is what we found in verse number 7, and I've mentioned it already, is that

203
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,920
we walk in the light, that we walk in the light.

204
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,559
You know, the reality is that throughout the Scriptures, there are many times in which

205
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,040
we find, in fact, a perfect, great example of it is in Joseph's life that he was living

206
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,640
in the presence of God.

207
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,399
And when Potiphar's wife saw that there was no one in the house and she saw that this

208
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,119
was the perfect opportunity, I believe that Joseph understood that God was present.

209
00:15:54,119 --> 00:16:02,440
When we learn to walk in the light as He is in the light and we learn to live in that

210
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,000
realm and live in that close fellowship and communion with Him, it will impact how we

211
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
live our lives, and we should sin less.

212
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,720
Let me ask you, parents, do your children behave a certain way when they know that you

213
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,440
are there in their presence?

214
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,440
Sure they do.

215
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,480
Just as the illustration that I mentioned a moment ago with regard to the police officer

216
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,720
sitting in the median of the highway.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,720
There are people that obey the speed limit whether there's a police officer present or

218
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,880
not, but there are others that just because of the presence of law enforcement, it will

219
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,440
change their behavior.

220
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,640
And as we understand that human trait and we understand that reality, it is such that

221
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,320
as I walk in the light as He is in the light, everywhere I go, my God is with me.

222
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,640
Man, that's going to affect how I live my life, and it will lead to a place of sinning

223
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
less.

224
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Amen?

225
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,839
Number two, not only walk in the light, but stay in His Word.

226
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,079
Remember last week we belabored the point where the Bible told us in verses 6, 8, and

227
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,279
10 of chapter number 1 that they were saying this, but the reality was something different.

228
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:16,359
In verses 8 and 10, the Bible says that the truth is not in us and His Word is not in

229
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
us.

230
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,320
The Bible says in John 17 and verse number 17, sanctify them through Thy Word, Thy Word

231
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,500
is truth.

232
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,899
This book, as D.L.

233
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:33,059
Moody said, and I often quote, will keep us from sin, or sin will keep us from this book.

234
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,040
And how important it is that we stay in His Word.

235
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,480
There was a direct correlation in verses 8 and 10 between that deception and all that

236
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,760
was taking place within the lives of those individuals with an absence of the Word of

237
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,559
God.

238
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,799
How I must stay in the Word.

239
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,559
And then I would say this, that I must walk in the Spirit.

240
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,040
The Bible tells us in Galatians 5 and verse number 16, if you walk in the Spirit, ye shall

241
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,640
not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

242
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,359
I'm thankful this morning that God has given us freedom from the bondage of sin.

243
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,700
And that when John gives this appeal to his readers, and by way of preservation to us

244
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,839
this morning, that the Bible says, I say unto you, I write these things unto you, that ye

245
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:25,239
sin not, that this is an appeal that we must take and we must respond to.

246
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:31,359
And as we evaluate our lives, we say, I want to sin less and less as I walk with Christ.

247
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,359
And it's possible.

248
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,919
Listen, it's not this excuse of the devil made me do it.

249
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,719
Amen?

250
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,239
Honestly.

251
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:45,599
That we begin to understand the truth of what God is giving us here, and the importance

252
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,520
of this appeal to the believer.

253
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,200
We note the appeal to the believer.

254
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,440
Number two, if you're taking notes, I want you to understand an advocate for the believer.

255
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,640
There's an appeal to every believer, but I'm so thankful, and it should cause us to rejoice

256
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,000
greatly that we have an advocate.

257
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,039
The Bible says this, my little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.

258
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:17,840
Then notice the next phrase, and if any man sin, now, we try to sin not, we are walking

259
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,359
in the light as he is in the light, we're in his Word, we're abiding in the truth, we're

260
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,919
abiding in him, we're walking in the Spirit, but the reality is that you have flesh and

261
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,799
I have flesh, and guess what?

262
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,799
We sin.

263
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,799
Right?

264
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,320
Have you found it to be the case?

265
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,479
You say, I'm going to do everything I can not to sin tomorrow, I'm just going to stay

266
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,960
in bed all day.

267
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,760
Well, you forgot about redeeming the time.

268
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
Right?

269
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,840
Listen, we can put parameters in place, but the reality is that we have this flesh, and

270
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:57,520
as we have this flesh, the flesh at, listen, is at enmity with the Spirit, Galatians 5,

271
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
right?

272
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,039
In our own Christian experience.

273
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,239
has taught us, has revealed to us, that yes, we should have that desire, we should

274
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:11,199
respond to that appeal, that I sin not, but I'm so thankful that when I sin, I

275
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:18,119
have an advocate. What wonderful Bible truth is given to us here in this

276
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,919
portion of Scripture. I want you to notice how our advocate is described. The

277
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,479
Bible says, and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father. Notice this

278
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:34,079
description, Jesus Christ the righteous. Aren't you thankful that he's righteous,

279
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:42,719
perfectly just, he's without sin. The Bible continues with this description in

280
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:48,679
verse number two. I want you to see that it says this, and he is the propitiation

281
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:56,959
for our sins. Notice this, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the

282
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:04,319
whole world. I'm so thankful that Christ paid the price for the sin of mankind,

283
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:11,359
and he is the propitiation for our sins, and also for the sins of the whole world.

284
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,279
It says in 1 John 4, in verse number 10, turn over just a few pages, it says

285
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:24,239
here in his love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to

286
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:30,799
be the propitiation for our sins. That word is a word, again, we mentioned

287
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,239
lasciviousness earlier, this word propitiation is a word that we may not

288
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:39,239
use very often. It's a word that is something that we use theologically

289
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:43,599
more than maybe in our everyday vernacular, but when we think about this

290
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,079
word, it means the satisfaction. It means that Jesus Christ satisfied the

291
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:54,359
demands of God. He paid for the sin. It's also interesting because it really

292
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,479
relates to the Old Testament truth of the mercy seat. In fact, the same Greek

293
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,039
word is used in Hebrews 9 and translated as mercy seat. When you think about that,

294
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,439
you begin to get that picture in your mind of the mercy seat, you'll be

295
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:12,199
familiar with the tabernacle, as God had given instruction to Moses to build this

296
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,879
tabernacle, and all of the details, the pattern that was provided, and you'll

297
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,879
find that there was the outer court, and then you come in and there's the holy

298
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,919
place, right? And you find that within the holy place is the Holy of Holies. When

299
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,079
you go into that Holy of Holies, by the way, it's only to be entered on the Day

300
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,919
of Atonement one time per year, and you would find that there was there, in that

301
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:39,279
Holy of Holies, the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant had originally

302
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:46,599
three items within it. The law, it had the pot of manna, and it had Aaron's bud,

303
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,639
or Aaron's rod that budded. We find that, as you would think about the law, and

304
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,999
you'd think about that Ark of the Covenant, you would find that really we

305
00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:03,079
could refer to that as being a throne of judgment. We're guilty. But perfectly

306
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:09,959
placed upon the top of that Ark of the Covenant is what? The mercy seat. The

307
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:16,359
mercy seat. And it perfectly, completely covers the Ark of the Covenant, and what

308
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,999
was a throne of judgment now becomes a throne of grace. Why? Because the blood

309
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,399
would be applied once a year, and you would find that as that blood was

310
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,319
applied, that you would find that atonement had been made, and what joy

311
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:35,039
that is, and now that throne of judgment becomes a throne of grace. And as we see

312
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,639
here, that the Bible describes our advocate as being Jesus Christ the

313
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:46,919
righteous, but also reveals to us that He is the propitiation for our sins, the

314
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,439
sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, His burial, and His glorious

315
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:58,959
resurrection. Listen, it was sufficient, and it was complete in satisfying God. We

316
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:04,199
ought to rejoice greatly in that truth. We find that as we would consider the

317
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:08,879
description that is given to us in these verses of Scripture with regard to our

318
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:13,439
advocate, we would find that the description proves to us that Jesus is

319
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:20,039
indeed perfectly qualified to serve as our advocate. By the way, He's the only

320
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,319
one that's qualified to serve as our advocate. Not only is He perfect and

321
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:31,359
without sin, the fact that He is Jesus Christ the righteous, but also understand

322
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:39,599
that He made the accepted payment for the sin of mankind. There's a, I believe,

323
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,559
as we've mentioned before, there is a false teaching that seems to grow in

324
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,319
more prevalence today. In fact, it's creeping its way into many of our Bible

325
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,999
colleges today. It's creeping its way into many of our Baptist churches today,

326
00:24:54,999 --> 00:25:02,839
and we see it growing in its allure, and really the appeal of this false teaching

327
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:10,399
is really one of intellect. And here's what I would say. Verse number two helps

328
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,439
us so much with this false teaching. It's this false teaching. No doubt you've

329
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:18,799
heard of Calvinism, and part of Calvinism teaches that there is a limited

330
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,879
atonement. In other words, they would say that Jesus only died for certain people,

331
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:31,399
His atonement was limited. The Bible, however, tells us here that He is the

332
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:38,679
propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the

333
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:45,159
whole world. Isn't that so precious? John 3 and verse number 16, a verse that we

334
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,879
commonly quote and understand, "...for God so loved the world that He gave His only

335
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,759
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting

336
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:02,879
life." And we must be careful about this subject and this teaching of Calvinism.

337
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:07,639
This isn't the only area in which they err, but you would find, and I'm not

338
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,559
seeking to be prideful or to get in arguments with people, people that watch

339
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,359
online, I'm sure, man, they'll send me emails and what-have-you, but the reality

340
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:22,919
is that the Bible teaches that Christ satisfied the sin for all of mankind.

341
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:32,279
His payment satisfied the requirement, not for our sins only, but also for

342
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,519
the sins of the whole world. That ought to cause us to rejoice. Listen, if you

343
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,959
understand this morning your place in human history, you'd understand that

344
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:49,799
you're one of the whole world. Amen? And you understand that Jesus died for you.

345
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,879
The song that they sang this morning, what a precious song. Aren't you thankful

346
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,679
that when you can hear the words of that song that you can identify and say, yes,

347
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:08,159
Jesus died for me. Praise God. Hallelujah. What a Savior. As we think about the

348
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:13,159
description that is provided of our Advocate, we then could ask this question,

349
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,719
not only how our Advocate is described, but notice with me the work that our

350
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:26,679
Advocate does. So precious as you'd really think of and understand this word

351
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:33,479
Advocate as really being the fact that He's our defense attorney. And really as

352
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:38,039
we look at this passage of Scripture, these verses here in verse 1 and 2, and

353
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,679
understand the truth that is being communicated to us, it is a perfect

354
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,119
illustration of what we find in 1 John 1 and verse number 9. If we confess

355
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,399
our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us

356
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,919
from all unrighteousness. But how is that practically applied? How does that work?

357
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,359
What does it look like? The reality this morning is that in order to adequately

358
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:06,199
explain these verses of Scripture, I believe that we, in our mind's eye, must

359
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:11,039
enter into the courtroom. I'm thankful this morning that I've never been in the

360
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,839
courtroom standing on trial. Amen. I got called to jury duty once, so I got a

361
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,159
little bit of experience. We have some within our congregation that are

362
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,639
attorneys, lawyers, that have work in law enforcement and have experience being in

363
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:27,279
the courtroom, and so they might be able to relate a little better than some of

364
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,559
us, but no doubt we each have some level of awareness of what happens in the

365
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,239
courtroom. And as we enter into the courtroom in our mind's eye this morning,

366
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:44,320
if we can imagine the judge being God the Father, and He sits in His rightful

367
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,239
place as being the judge, and you find that the accuser is there. Who's the

368
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:56,000
accuser? Well, according to Revelation 12 in verse number 10, it's Satan. He is the

369
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,599
accuser. He is the accuser of the brethren, and he's there in this courtroom,

370
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:10,079
but I'm thankful that there's also our advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous. And

371
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:17,239
then there we stand, the accused, the defendant. And we stand in this courtroom,

372
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:22,799
and from your perspective, and I'll just come down here this morning so that I

373
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,039
can kind of look the same way you are. If I can get a picture of a courtroom, the

374
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,079
judge is here in the center. He's sitting upon the bench there, and perhaps at a

375
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,199
table over here is where I'm seated as the defendant, and I have my defense

376
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:41,639
attorney, Jesus Christ the righteous, standing by my side. And then over here

377
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:47,479
at this other table, there's the prosecutor, the accuser of the brethren,

378
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:54,719
Satan. And we find that as we're there in that courtroom, it's quite

379
00:29:54,719 --> 00:30:01,479
different than what we might imagine in a court of law today upon earth.

380
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:04,819
Because our defense attorney, Jesus Christ the righteous,

381
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,979
He's actually not seeking to prove our innocence.

382
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,319
Why?

383
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,939
Because we're guilty.

384
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,659
Because we're guilty.

385
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,279
A defense attorney, if you were thinking about in a court of law today,

386
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,899
and you were thinking about sitting in a courtroom and hiring a defense attorney,

387
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:26,119
and you're going to hire this one,

388
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:32,839
they're going to be on your side as your advocate to try to prove your innocence.

389
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,579
The accuser, the prosecutor, is seeking to prove your guilt.

390
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:40,539
Right? Is that how it works?

391
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:45,999
And the accuser, the brethren, he stands up in all of his terribleness,

392
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:51,459
and he accuses us of whatever the sin might be.

393
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:58,999
And as he accuses us, the accusation is made, and we know that we're guilty.

394
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:02,599
And Jesus Christ the righteous stands up,

395
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:10,299
and He does not seek to provide some level of proving innocence,

396
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,499
declaring on the behalf of us, the defendant,

397
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:19,639
some way in which we can have the case fall in our favor as being declared innocent.

398
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,939
No, the reality is that forgiveness requires guilt.

399
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,779
Do you know that?

400
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,399
Forgiveness requires guilt.

401
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,139
A court does not pardon an innocent man.

402
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:40,479
There's no need for a pardon. You're innocent.

403
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:45,219
Our defense attorney, can you imagine in your mind today,

404
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:50,599
as you think about Jesus Christ, our advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous,

405
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,099
that He stands and He says,

406
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:57,759
Father, He's guilty.

407
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,219
He's guilty. Guilty as charged.

408
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,559
Now, what do you think the prosecutor does?

409
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,439
Oh, man, this is wonderful. They're not even trying.

410
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:15,619
But then He says this, I paid the price.

411
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:16,899
I paid the price.

412
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:25,699
I satisfied the requirement that would be placed upon this one because of their guilt.

413
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:28,539
I paid the price.

414
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:31,119
And in that courtroom, and in that setting,

415
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,499
as we think about this passage of Scripture illustrating for us so wonderfully,

416
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,659
the work that our advocate does,

417
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:41,799
that we find that Jesus Christ the righteous, our advocate,

418
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,539
He does not seek to defend us and to prove our innocence.

419
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,379
Rather, we find that He confirms our guilt,

420
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:55,339
but reminds the judge that the penalty has been paid.

421
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,659
It's satisfied. Isn't that wonderful?

422
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,119
And when you understand the portion of Scripture that is before us,

423
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,159
it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

424
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,659
To know that we have the perfectly qualified advocate,

425
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:14,919
Jesus Christ the righteous, His qualification is given to us,

426
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:17,039
and we find that He's standing there.

427
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,839
And the truth for every believer this morning,

428
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:26,459
for every single one of us is that, listen, we do sin.

429
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:30,339
Yes, the appeal is that you sin not.

430
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,939
But the reality is that we sin, and when we do,

431
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:38,239
we have an advocate.

432
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,599
We have an advocate.

433
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:46,679
And the accuser of the brethren is defeated every time.

434
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,799
Isn't that awesome?

435
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,099
He's defeated every single time.

436
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,059
When we look at the passage of Scripture and really find the truth of verse 9,

437
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:01,059
and how that is practically applied,

438
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,319
and the outworking of that truth as it's given to us in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 2,

439
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,019
I am thankful that as I confess our sins again,

440
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,659
an acknowledgment of the guilt.

441
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,699
I mentioned last week as we closed our passage of Scripture,

442
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,319
we closed our message last week,

443
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:26,359
it's not a desire or a seeking to excuse or to cover or hide our sin.

444
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:29,579
No, it's an acknowledgment of our guilt.

445
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,619
But what joy that He says that if we confess our sins,

446
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,919
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,

447
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:40,419
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

448
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:42,299
As I thought about this passage of Scripture,

449
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,919
meditated upon the truth contained herein,

450
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,839
I could not help but think of a court of law in our land today,

451
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:57,119
and we understand that we do not have perfect justice in our system today,

452
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,839
but I think about being a guilty sinner as I am, and as you are.

453
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,519
You know how hard it'd be to find a defense attorney?

454
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,519
Charges have been brought against you.

455
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,019
You look up on Google,

456
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,939
I need a defense attorney, here's what the crime is,

457
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,899
here's what the situation is,

458
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:20,879
I need to have an attorney that's going to help me in this particular area.

459
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:25,219
And you have that opening phone dialogue with that attorney,

460
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:29,019
they begin to ask you about the charges that have been brought against you.

461
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:32,139
They begin to ask you what happened and the circumstances and so on and so forth,

462
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:33,559
and then ask you what happened,

463
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:38,199
and you simply say, I did everything that I'm charged with.

464
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,699
Well, that's going to be a tricky job for the defense attorney.

465
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:44,399
He's going to try to enter some kind of plea,

466
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:48,999
he's going to do whatever he can do to try to lessen charges, so on and so forth.

467
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,619
I'm guilty.

468
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:57,359
And our advocate says, I know you are, but I paid the price.

469
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,439
I paid the price.

470
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:04,479
And that old serpent, the accuser of the brethren, the prosecutor,

471
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:08,639
he brings those accusations against you and against me.

472
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,999
But we must be mindful that in that courtroom, we have an advocate.

473
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,279
And he's our defense attorney.

474
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:22,459
And as we determine in our lives that I'm not going to cover, excuse,

475
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:30,879
I'm not going to hide my sin, guilty as charged.

476
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:33,479
But Jesus paid for it.

477
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,919
And he is my advocate.

478
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,759
If you're saved this morning, he's your advocate.

479
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:42,679
I wouldn't want to enter the courtroom without an advocate.

480
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,839
Amen?

481
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:53,279
The Bible tells us of a great white throne in Revelation 20, verses 11 through 15.

482
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,359
Those are not saved people.

483
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,079
They do not have Jesus Christ the righteous as their advocate.

484
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,959
And the sentence is given out in what is it?

485
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,719
The lake of fire, the second death.

486
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,919
Right?

487
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:11,239
But for us this morning, if we're saved, if you've trusted Jesus Christ,

488
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,479
you're a savior, man, he is our advocate.

489
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:22,199
And he's our defense attorney, never seeking to argue our innocence,

490
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,119
but simply stating guilty but paid.

491
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,759
And that should cause us to rejoice greatly.

492
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,559
Listen, this morning as we look at these two verses of Scripture,

493
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,639
let us beware of the false teaching that seems to be prevalent in our society today.

494
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,719
Not just today, but for all of church history,

495
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:48,879
where the enemy has twisted the powerful biblical truth of the grace of God,

496
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:53,519
and the reality of the precious truth of the forgiveness of God,

497
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,159
in leading the people of God to thinking that they can sin freely

498
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,799
and live however they want to live because God's grace is abundant

499
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:04,639
and because God will forgive, and so just do what you want to do,

500
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,279
live how you want to live.

501
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:12,519
No, the grace of God is not to be answered with,

502
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:17,439
what shall we do then, shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

503
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:21,079
God forbid.

504
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,439
And John says, I'm writing these things unto you that ye sin not.

505
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:29,559
That we come to that place as we walk in the light,

506
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,599
as we feast upon His Word, as we walk in the Spirit,

507
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,880
that we're sinning less and less every day as we walk with Him.

508
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,719
That should cause us to, that appeal that is given,

509
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,239
should cause us to respond with examination.

510
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:52,599
To really, listen, if an individual has this idea that they can just go and live

511
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,199
however they want to live and just sin and sin and sin and just build up,

512
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:02,519
they really have to evaluate whether they're in the faith.

513
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,399
There's a man that I met many years ago, probably at this point,

514
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:11,399
probably close to 25 years ago, and he was living like the devil.

515
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,440
That's just being plain.

516
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,919
And he was boasting on a Sunday night after church, I wasn't saved,

517
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:20,639
it was in Jacksonville, North Carolina, young Marines,

518
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,959
they were outside talking and this guy was just bragging about all the sin

519
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,959
that he was involved in.

520
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:31,320
And I remember as a young teenager hearing this guy talk about this wickedness,

521
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,760
and here's what he followed up with it by saying this,

522
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,399
but I got saved and so I got my corner of heaven.

523
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,320
And I wasn't even saved at that point, but I thought,

524
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,479
that just doesn't seem right.

525
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,039
Right?

526
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,639
Just doesn't seem right.

527
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:54,440
The appeal is that we sin not, that we sin not.

528
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,399
It should cause us to reflect and respond with examination.

529
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:01,519
God's given us all of the tools necessary.

530
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:10,939
if I can use that phraseology to enable us to no longer be bound by sin, amen?

531
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:18,399
But then we should rejoice in this truth that there's an advocate for the believer, because

532
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:28,279
though my goal and though my aim, my ambition is that I would sin not, I'm going to sin,

533
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:30,919
and so are you.

534
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:37,999
You ever have a child that wants so desperately to please you as a parent, and then they fail,

535
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:38,999
they mess up.

536
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:44,919
Man, it can destroy them, just crush them, they're just so disappointed about them being

537
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:52,159
a failure and a disappointment to their parent, but you provide that way back for them, right?

538
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,279
And as we think about the reality is that though my goal and my aim is that I would

539
00:40:56,279 --> 00:41:02,419
sin not, that when I sin, it does not lead to utter defeat.

540
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:07,759
But I understand and I acknowledge that I have an advocate, and all I must do is confess

541
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,759
that sin.

542
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:16,359
Yes, I'm guilty, it was wicked what I did, what I thought, what I said, God, would You

543
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:17,359
forgive me?

544
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,559
Listen, we ought to keep a short sin account with God.

545
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:28,419
What renders the believer so ineffective today is the way in which the enemy twists

546
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,879
these wonderful truths of the Word of God.

547
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:37,919
And you have people sitting in churches all across the world today that have been influenced

548
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:45,919
by some false teaching, and we've been rendered ineffective, and that's sad.

549
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:50,159
Listen, I want God to use me, I want God to use you.

550
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,519
He uses clean vessels, amen?

551
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,519
Not perfect.

552
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:00,359
I understand my standing, I'm perfectly justified in my standing, amen, 100%.

553
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,199
His righteousness has been imputed upon my account, amen?

554
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,999
2 Corinthians 5 verse 21, I am so thankful for that.

555
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:17,519
But practically, practically, I'm not perfect, and neither are you.

556
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:23,399
But we desire to be clean so that God can use us, amen?

557
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:27,879
There's an appeal to the believer that you sin not, but how we ought to rejoice that

558
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,279
we have an advocate.

559
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:34,919
There is an advocate for the believer, Jesus Christ the righteous, let's pray.

560
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,999
Father, we love You.

561
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:39,079
How we thank You for loving us.

562
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:46,439
God, I pray that if there were one present today that's not sure of heaven, that they

563
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,959
would understand how they could be saved.

564
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:55,799
Father, I think of this message, no doubt, starting out with my little children being

565
00:42:55,799 --> 00:43:02,079
written and being delivered to save people.

566
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:15,119
I pray that as we examine that appeal, that we'd respond with examination and truly desire

567
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,959
to sin not.

568
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:24,679
As we walk with You, that we would be able to see in our lives that we sin less today

569
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:31,679
than we did before, because we're walking in the light.

570
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,159
And when we sin, would You help us to remember that we have an advocate?

571
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:48,079
Help us not to go about to try to prove our innocence or argue our innocence.

572
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:59,599
Help us to humbly acknowledge, confess our sin, knowing that it's been paid for and that

573
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,299
You promise to forgive.

574
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:04,839
Thank You for this wonderful truth.

575
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,139
Help us not to be influenced by false teaching.

576
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:17,739
Help us not to live thinking that we have a license to sin and live however we want.

577
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:25,579
Help us to have that desire to be a clean vessel fit for the Master's use.

578
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,499
Would You move and work in hearts and lives as only You can.

579
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,939
We'll be careful to give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do.

580
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,219
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

581
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:34,379
Would You?
