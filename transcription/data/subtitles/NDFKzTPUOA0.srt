1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
And turn in the word of God the book of Colossians and we'll be studying this year through this book as we had our introductory

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:12,399
Message last week looking at our theme from Colossians chapter 2 in verse number 10

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,700
When paul said to these that he's writing to in colossi and ye are complete

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,079
In him complete in christ complete in him

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,659
And as we dig into this book in the first chapter, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 8 this morning colossians

6
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,860
Chapter number 1 looking at verses 1 through 8

7
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,400
If you are taking notes in that new sermon notebook that you picked up yesterday

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,299
you will

9
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,259
Want to title the message this morning to the saints

10
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:44,819
At colossi to the saints

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,779
At colossi the bible says this in verse number one of colossians 1 paul

12
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,779
An apostle of jesus christ by the will of god

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Timotheus our brother

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,959
And so we find right in the beginning of this book that god gives us the human penman to the book of colossians

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,819
And that being the apostle paul you understand that he says an apostle of jesus christ

16
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:14,580
Notice what it says by the will of god and the apostle paul understood that he was what he was by the grace of god

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
He understood the calling

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,120
That god had placed upon his life and he understood

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,559
Uh the great responsibility that he had

20
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,199
Uh, and what a joy and what a blessing to see a man who was yielded to the holy spirit of god

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,000
a man that was used to cause the

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,559
Instruct people and to uh be involved in the cause of christ moving forward

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
The bible says in timotheus

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,519
Our brother, we know that paul had a close relationship with timothy

25
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:52,360
Often even as you find he would refer to timothy as being his own son in the faith and you understand

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,080
They traveled and journeyed together. They ministered alongside one another and paul

27
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,699
invested in timothy and paul

28
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,199
instructed timothy and uh

29
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:08,919
We find that of course the bible would help us to understand the human penman and the human authorship

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,199
We understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and this is the word of god

31
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,559
But god would use paul humanly speaking to pen these words

32
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:21,240
The bible says in verse number two of colossians one to

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,779
The saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colossi

34
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,520
Grace be unto you and peace from god our father

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,119
and

36
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:38,520
The lord jesus christ we will go down through verse number eight this morning in our study

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:45,419
But as we kind of give some background information to this church here this group of believers in the city of colossi

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:53,100
We would understand geographically that the city of colossi was located roughly a hundred miles east of ephesus

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,880
and as we would begin to think about the geography and we'd understand some things and

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,119
with regard to the city of colossi this ancient city that was

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Uh very

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,199
Involved in trade and what have you at the time of the writing?

43
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,839
As paul is now addressing this group of believers. We'd understand that the

44
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,559
City had kind of already

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Had its its highest days if you will it was a city in decline because of some

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,320
Changes with trade routes and so on and so forth, but we find that this city

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,940
Was was roughly a hundred miles east of ephesus

48
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:33,020
We understand when we think about the geographical location

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,139
Of this particular city of colossi that paul spent an extended period of time in ephesus

50
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,679
and the bible would tell us that during

51
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,479
the time that paul was in ephesus if you

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Hold your place here in colossians and turn to the book of acts in the 19th chapter

53
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,600
And god is giving us some information here

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,240
In the book of acts with regard to the missionary journey and all that god would use paul and those that accompanied him

55
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,720
to accomplish for the cause of christ

56
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,179
The bible would tell us that while he spent this extended period of time in ephesus

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,160
That the gospel threat spread throughout asia

58
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,240
in fact

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,579
You will understand and keep your place there in acts 19, but you'll understand that in acts chapter number 16

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,119
when they were seeking the will of god with regard to

61
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,320
Taking the gospel forward the bible tells us that they were forbidden to the holy ghost

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,000
To preach the word in asia in acts 16 in verse number six

63
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:40,619
Though they had endeavored and desired to go to that region and it was when they were in ephesus as it's recorded in acts 19

64
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:48,059
Notice in verse number 10 the bible says this and this continued by the space of two years

65
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,500
What was it that continued the teaching of the word of god?

66
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:57,980
The instruction that paul was giving to those and the bible says so that all they

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,579
So that all they which dwelt in asia, excuse me heard the word of the lord jesus

68
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,299
both jews and

69
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,739
greeks now

70
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:16,380
As we notice acts 19 in verse number 10 and the bible tells us so that all they which dwelt in asia

71
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,200
Heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks and we understand

72
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:25,260
That when the bible refers to here in acts 19 in verse number 10 to asia

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,619
Is speaking about that region that we would refer to as asia minor and we'd understand that the gospel was going forth

74
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:40,380
That paul was instructing the believers there in ephesus and people were hearing the gospel and they were taking the word of god

75
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,260
uh into their communities and into their

76
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,200
neighborhoods if you will and they were spreading forth the gospel

77
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:53,100
And the bible tells us that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks now

78
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:58,299
That's encouraging to me because that's the model that god has set forth. That is the plan

79
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,540
That jesus has established that the gospel would go forth into all the world and we find

80
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,359
That with colossi being a hundred miles roughly to the east of ephesus

81
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,579
That it is certainly possible that during the earthly ministry of the apostle paul in ephesus though

82
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,079
He himself never traveled to colossi

83
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,140
That we would understand that the gospel spread forth

84
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:28,859
And no doubt people in the city of colossi had the privilege of hearing the gospel

85
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,059
As I mentioned just a moment ago the apostle paul never personally ministered in the city of colossi

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,299
He did not know these believers

87
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,980
personally

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,519
In fact, if you read verse number one of chapter two the book of colossians

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,220
The bible says for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them

90
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:53,339
At laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in

91
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:59,579
The flesh the apostle paul never ministered personally in colossi. He did not know

92
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:03,920
By name the individuals that he's writing to in the book of colossians

93
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:10,299
It's interesting for as we look at other books of the bible that god would use the apostle paul to write

94
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,540
There are many times in which you see the personal influence and you find

95
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,179
The names of individuals that are

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Referenced and you can go back to the book of acts and you can read about the time and ministry

97
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,839
Of the apostle paul amongst those very people that he's writing back to and that's not the case here with the book of colossians

98
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,459
however

99
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,279
As you read the book of colossians, you really get the sense you understand

100
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,040
the love and

101
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,500
Concern that paul had for each of these believers

102
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:51,559
Now that's encouraging to me. In fact, it is a challenge to me to see how the apostle paul had such

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
uh, just a desire

104
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,399
Uh for these believers in colossi believers that he never even met

105
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,480
But believers that he heard about their testimony. He received from epaphras this

106
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:13,179
Uh this report this testimony and paul has this love and genuine concern for these believers

107
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:17,500
And you find that as you read through and study the book of colossians

108
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,779
There will be some names that you recognize

109
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,399
Apaphras is one of them and we'll mention that as we go through the message even this morning

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,880
But as you get into the end of the book of colossians, you'll see a couple of additional names

111
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,599
In which you will recognize from some of the other writings of paul

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,640
uh and and some of the names of the individuals that are referenced in the book of colossians and so

113
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,919
As we look here and we think about this man epaphras the bible tells us

114
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,719
That he was a faithful minister

115
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,719
and

116
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:55,739
The individual that informed paul about the group of believers here in colossi

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,760
Look down at verse number seven in colossians one. The bible says as you also learned

118
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:06,859
Of epaphras our dear fellow servant who was for you a faithful minister

119
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,080
of christ

120
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
As we begin to think about the

121
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
geography if you will

122
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,979
Of colossi you begin to think about the way in which paul learned about this group of believers in colossi

123
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,799
It was through the testimony of epaphras that would bring this report

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,700
And paul would be informed and he would be aware that there's a group of believers in this city in colossi

125
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,659
that were

126
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:38,919
Assembling and growing and serving and what a blessing that must have been to the heart of the apostle paul

127
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,239
Unfortunately as we find throughout the history of the church

128
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:48,059
Here even in colossi we would find as we read through the book of colossians

129
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,859
That false teaching had crept in we understand the bible teaches us that there will be false teachers

130
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,840
We understand today that as we live in 2021

131
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,859
That there are many false

132
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,659
false teachers that abound.

133
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,279
It is so vital that we understand

134
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,759
that we are settled and grounded

135
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,439
in the truth of this Book.

136
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,279
How thankful we ought to be

137
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,239
as New Testament believers

138
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,639
that we have the complete canon of Scripture

139
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,039
and that we can go to the Word of God

140
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,959
and we can understand what

141
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,719
thus saith the Lord.

142
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,799
But these believers in Colossae,

143
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,319
there were some false teachers

144
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,999
that had crept in.

145
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,079
Now you understand.

146
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
When false teachers come into an assembly,

147
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,879
they do not wear a name tag

148
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,279
that says, I'm a false teacher.

149
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,079
They do not announce broadly

150
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,879
to the people that they're seeking

151
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,599
to come in and assemble with

152
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,719
and influence that they are false teachers.

153
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,039
No, as Jude would say it,

154
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,319
they creep in unawares.

155
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,799
They try to fly under the radar, if you will.

156
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,719
We have often said during the time of ministry here

157
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,399
that God has given me that false teachers,

158
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,879
one of the ways in which they operate

159
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,039
is that they will use the same words that we use.

160
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,599
They will use our vocabulary.

161
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:16,039
The problem is that they have a different definition.

162
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,119
They mean something entirely different

163
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,399
than we would mean by the very same words

164
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,559
that we would speak.

165
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,759
And it's so vitally important

166
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,999
that we are so grounded in the truth of this Word.

167
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,239
It was an unfortunate set of events

168
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,399
that led to this false teaching

169
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,639
creeping into the church in Colossae.

170
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,319
But how thankful I am

171
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,079
that the Lord would use His Word

172
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,239
to correct the false teaching

173
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:44,199
and to properly instruct the believers in Colossae.

174
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,479
I'm thankful that Epaphras was there,

175
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,759
a faithful minister of Christ.

176
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,599
Oh, what a blessing it is.

177
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:53,679
Even last year as we studied through the book of Hebrews

178
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,359
and we mentioned in Hebrews 13,

179
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,359
those 10 things that we ought to be thankful for,

180
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,959
that we ought to rejoice in.

181
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,719
And we mentioned about spiritual leaders

182
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,479
and how thankful we should be

183
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,559
for those that would be called,

184
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,919
that would be referred to as a faithful minister of Christ.

185
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,799
Someone who would stand up

186
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,719
and faithfully proclaim the truth of the Word of God

187
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,519
without compromise.

188
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,959
The Bible says that those that are preachers,

189
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,039
those that are pastors,

190
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,279
that were to preach the Word,

191
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,039
the instant in-season, out-of-season,

192
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,879
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

193
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,919
with all long-suffering in doctrine.

194
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,879
We understand that the time will come

195
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,039
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

196
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,119
but our responsibility is to preach the Word.

197
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,719
It may not be popular.

198
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:42,319
In fact, we're finding the closer we get

199
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,679
to the return of our Savior,

200
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,519
that it's becoming less and less popular.

201
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,919
But oh, I'm thankful for Epaphras,

202
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,959
who was a faithful minister of Christ,

203
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,919
who was engaged in helping these believers in God

204
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,439
through allowing Epaphras to communicate with Paul,

205
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,239
would then, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

206
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,639
use Paul to send this letter,

207
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,719
the book of Colossians,

208
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,599
to properly instruct,

209
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,679
to correct that false teaching

210
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,479
and properly instruct these believers.

211
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,679
Oh, how thankful I am for the Word of God.

212
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,399
I'm thankful that the Word of God,

213
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,719
as I've referenced already this morning,

214
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,799
that passage in 2 Timothy 3,

215
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,799
that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

216
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,639
The Bible says,

217
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,519
and is profitable for doctrine,

218
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,039
for reproof, for correction,

219
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,559
for instruction in righteousness,

220
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,199
that the man of God may be perfect,

221
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,799
throughly furnished unto all good works.

222
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,079
I know I've said it often.

223
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,479
It's worth repeating.

224
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:54,519
We need more of this book, not less.

225
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,599
There's a popular movement within our world today

226
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:01,679
of we need less preaching.

227
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,879
We need less teaching.

228
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,279
We need more entertainment.

229
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,599
No, we need the Word of God.

230
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,919
In your life, in my life personally,

231
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,359
I need more of God's Word.

232
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,999
We've just now entered into the second week

233
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,119
of a brand new year.

234
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,679
I hope that you've made the decision

235
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,599
that in 2021 that you're going to read the Bible

236
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,799
more than you did in 2020.

237
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,159
That you're going to dig in.

238
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,879
That you're going to allow the Word of God

239
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,959
to impact and influence your life

240
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,959
to have its work and its way in your life.

241
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,159
We need more of God's Word, not less.

242
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,079
Someone said this,

243
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,959
that thumbprints in the Bible

244
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,199
are more important than footprints on the moon.

245
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,719
And I like it.

246
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,279
Because we need the Word of God.

247
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,079
Let me clarify, I am not simply saying

248
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,359
that you read it as fast as you can

249
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,039
to say I read the Bible ten times this year.

250
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,479
If you could, that's wonderful.

251
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,079
I endeavor annually, personally,

252
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,079
to read the Bible through several times.

253
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,119
But I would say to you,

254
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:08,839
as I've said to many people personally,

255
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,959
the quality is more important than the quantity.

256
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,359
To truly allow the Word of God to get into you.

257
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,279
That we truly determine that we're going to be

258
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,759
doers of the Word and not hearers only.

259
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,159
In this book of Colossians,

260
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,159
when it was originally sent

261
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,519
from the Apostle Paul to this group of believers,

262
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,839
oh, I'm sure it was a great encouragement

263
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,919
as we'll find as we read through

264
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,959
and study through this book,

265
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
to hear how Paul,

266
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
though they may have heard of him,

267
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,879
they never met him personally,

268
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,079
how he says, I'm praying for you.

269
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,039
And then he tells them how he's praying for them.

270
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,719
I mean, just the encouragement

271
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,399
that these believers would receive.

272
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,359
But then the instruction that they would receive

273
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,559
to correct that false teaching.

274
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,479
I'm so thankful that God's given us

275
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,000
the Word of God.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,759
I believe that these original recipients,

277
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,000
the day in which they originally received

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,639
this letter that we refer to

279
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,239
as the book of Colossians,

280
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,279
that there was excitement.

281
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,839
That there was joy.

282
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,279
I mean, this was a big deal

283
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,879
that we've received a letter from Paul,

284
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,639
the Apostle.

285
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,039
I believe they were excited about it.

286
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,000
They understood that it was the Word of God.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,159
They're going to set it aside.

288
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,639
I'll get to it later.

289
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,039
No.

290
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,079
They want to know the content of this letter.

291
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,319
I believe that it was impactful in their lives.

292
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,639
As we notice as we study through

293
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,799
this first several verses of Colossians 1,

294
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,719
I want you to notice with me,

295
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,119
number one, how they were described.

296
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:55,279
Notice how these believers

297
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,559
are described for us.

298
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,559
The Bible tells us that Paul's writing to them

299
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,559
in verse 1, but then notice the description

300
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,919
in verse 2.

301
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,359
The Bible says, to the saints.

302
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,279
To the saints.

303
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,119
We understand.

304
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,679
We've even titled the message this morning

305
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,199
to the saints at Colossae.

306
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,279
It will say, and faithful brethren in Christ,

307
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,239
which are at Colossae.

308
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,239
I'm so thankful for this word saint.

309
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,039
I would say to you this morning,

310
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,959
even as I mentioned a few moments ago

311
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,399
by way of introduction,

312
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,239
that there are those today

313
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,279
within the broad category of Christendom

314
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,239
that would use the word saint,

315
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,959
but they have a different definition.

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They mean something entirely different

317
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,959
than what the Bible means

318
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,919
when the Bible uses the word saint.

319
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,199
The word saint.

320
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,959
It means holy one.

321
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,439
It means those who have been saved.

322
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,119
It means those who have been redeemed

323
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,319
by the blood of the Lamb.

324
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,000
A real good definition for saint is this.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,719
One who is in Christ

326
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,359
and in whom Christ dwells.

327
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,439
A saint.

328
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,479
One who is in Christ

329
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:08,199
and in whom Christ dwells.

330
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,359
We find that Paul,

331
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,719
as he would write to the believers in Ephesus,

332
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,039
that he says to them

333
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,879
in v. 1 of Ephesians 1,

334
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,639
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

335
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:17,919
by the will of God,

336
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,799
to the saints, which are at Ephesus.

337
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,119
When he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

338
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,199
another church in which he had

339
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:27,759
the opportunity to minister to

340
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,559
and had the privilege of being able

341
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,519
to serve alongside,

342
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,359
he says here, Paul and Timotheus,

343
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,799
the servants of Jesus Christ,

344
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,519
to all the saints in Christ Jesus

345
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,919
which are at Philippi

346
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,679
with the bishops and deacons.

347
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,719
And then here in Colossians 1,

348
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,479
in v. 2, to the saints

349
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,119
and faithful brethren in Christ

350
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,440
which are at Colossae.

351
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,159
Oh, I'm so thankful for the recognition

352
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,959
at the very beginning of this book

353
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,000
that we'd understand that Paul

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,799
is writing to believers.

355
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,159
He's writing to people that have been born again.

356
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,399
To people that are saved.

357
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:06,119
They're referred to as saints.

358
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,279
One who is in Christ,

359
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,000
in whom Christ dwells.

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,839
Oh, what a blessing.

361
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,359
I want you to notice that not only

362
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,200
does he call them saints,

363
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,719
but he says, and faithful brethren.

364
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,519
Faithful brethren.

365
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,239
I love the description

366
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,880
of these believers in Colossae.

367
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,799
Saints and faithful brethren.

368
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,519
Faithfulness is to be commended.

369
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
It seems as if as we would go through life

370
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,880
and we'd understand various influences

371
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,799
of our culture and our society,

372
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,599
that it would seem as if by and large

373
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,039
the importance of faithfulness

374
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
has kind of not been where it needs to be.

375
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,919
But I would submit to you that as the people of God,

376
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,239
that faithfulness is to be commended.

377
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,119
We understand that God says

378
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,079
faithfulness.

379
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,379
This is required that stewards,

380
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,339
1 Corinthians 4 and verse 2,

381
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,359
that it's required in stewards

382
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,299
that a man be found faithful.

383
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,399
We understand that Solomon

384
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,139
in the book of Proverbs

385
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:18,859
would express the value of faithfulness.

386
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,059
The Word of God is full of examples

387
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,659
of both men and women

388
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,939
who were faithful.

389
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,939
They were faithful.

390
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:30,939
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

391
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,739
He is faithful.

392
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:33,879
In fact, we sing,

393
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,579
great is thy faithfulness.

394
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:39,879
You begin to think about the faithfulness of God.

395
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:42,559
I hope this morning that when your mind

396
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,619
would reflect upon the faithfulness of God

397
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,439
that you'd be encouraged

398
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,359
to know that our God is trustworthy

399
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,479
and dependable.

400
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,279
God is faithful.

401
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,419
But we find that these believers in Colossae,

402
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,159
that they are being referred to

403
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,439
as being faithful brethren.

404
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,279
Faithful.

405
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,879
I'm thankful for the faithfulness

406
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,999
of the people in Colossae.

407
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,999
The way in which they're described.

408
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:09,619
Paul says,

409
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,759
grace be unto you and peace from God our Father

410
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,919
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

411
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,159
Notice in v. 3 of Colossians 1,

412
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,199
we give thanks to God

413
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,719
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

414
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:26,159
praying always for you.

415
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,799
We are going to use v. 3

416
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,919
in a future message

417
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,599
to begin to look at the prayer

418
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,119
that Paul records really

419
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,119
for these believers in Colossae.

420
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,119
In v. 9-14, he lets them know

421
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,719
how he's praying for them specifically.

422
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,799
But what a joy when you see

423
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,439
how the Apostle Paul is saying

424
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,719
to these believers in Colossae

425
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,279
that he is thankful for them,

426
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,439
that he's praying for them.

427
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,919
Notice in v. 4,

428
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

429
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,399
and of the love which ye have to all the saints.

430
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:05,039
Paul heard about their faith in Christ Jesus.

431
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,719
He heard about their conversion.

432
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,039
He heard that they had been born again.

433
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,199
As you continue to look,

434
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,519
you find that the Bible would reveal to us

435
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,119
how the Gospel got there

436
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,639
and they believed.

437
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,159
It says in v. 5,

438
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,279
for the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven,

439
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,239
whereof ye heard before

440
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,079
in the word of the truth of the Gospel,

441
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,679
notice where it says in v. 6,

442
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,119
which is come unto you

443
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,479
as it is in all the world,

444
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,239
and bringeth forth fruit

445
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,919
as it doth also in you,

446
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,639
since the day ye heard of it

447
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:44,079
and knew the grace of God in truth.

448
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,039
I'm so thankful for the testimony

449
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,959
of these believers in Colossae

450
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,799
for the way in which they are described.

451
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,759
I'm thankful for their salvation.

452
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,639
I'm thankful that one day,

453
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,199
I mean, we'll have the opportunity

454
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:59,799
of seeing these believers in Colossae

455
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,639
that were redeemed.

456
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:02,479
They've been saved.

457
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:05,159
The Bible says that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

458
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,799
And what a joy for all of eternity

459
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,879
to be with the saved, the believers.

460
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,439
It says that it's come unto you.

461
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,599
What has come unto you?

462
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,679
The word of the truth of the Gospel.

463
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,799
Notice where it says,

464
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,359
as it is in all the world.

465
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,879
The job of New Testament believers

466
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,679
is to preach the Gospel to every creature,

467
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,599
to go into all the world

468
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,119
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

469
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,639
I'm thankful that the Bible

470
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,919
would rehearse for us

471
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,679
and provide us with a record

472
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,199
of how the Word of God,

473
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,919
the Gospel of Jesus Christ

474
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,039
went in all the world.

475
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,759
Notice where it says in v. 6,

476
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,359
right in the middle of the verse,

477
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,239
"...bringeth forth fruit."

478
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,319
You know, this is a great promise

479
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,079
that we need to hold dear to our hearts.

480
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,479
The Bible says that the Gospel

481
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,519
bringeth forth fruit.

482
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,799
We understand that Paul said this in Romans 1

483
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,519
in v. 16 that he's not ashamed

484
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,639
of the Gospel of Christ,

485
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,879
why? For it is the power of God unto salvation.

486
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,879
And we find that we're to preach the Gospel

487
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:06,959
to every creature,

488
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,399
but we notice here in v. 6

489
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:11,319
that the Bible says that the Gospel

490
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:17,479
brings forth fruit.

491
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,799
The Gospel.

492
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,119
It brings fruit.

493
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,159
See, the seed of the Gospel

494
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,519
needs to get out of the barn.

495
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,879
There's no point in keeping the seed of the Gospel

496
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:28,999
in the barn. No.

497
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,519
There's a lost and dying world

498
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,879
that needs the Gospel.

499
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,519
And the Gospel brings fruit.

500
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,679
It produces fruit.

501
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,839
It is the power of God unto salvation.

502
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,359
It is the means that God has determined

503
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,239
that we would preach the Gospel to every creature.

504
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:51,479
And he says that it doth,

505
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,279
it says this,

506
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,959
"...and bringeth forth fruit

507
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,239
as it doth also in you."

508
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,839
So, understand with me

509
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,359
what Paul was saying to these believers in Colossae.

510
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,479
Understand with me personally

511
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:06,159
if we were to understand that I've been saved,

512
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,119
you've been saved,

513
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,439
you've trusted Jesus as your personal Savior,

514
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,999
and you can take the truth

515
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,439
of this passage of Scripture

516
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,599
and apply it in your own heart

517
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,559
and your own life,

518
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
that I've received the Gospel.

519
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,479
I've believed Jesus Christ.

520
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:21,719
I've trusted Him as my personal Savior.

521
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,959
I've been born again.

522
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,719
I can be referred to as a saint

523
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,919
because I am in Christ

524
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,079
and Christ dwells within me.

525
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,439
And we find here

526
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:33,199
that it brought forth fruit in me.

527
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,719
And it gives me the confidence

528
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,119
that it has the ability

529
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,479
to bring forth fruit in others.

530
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:43,239
What did the Gospel do for you?

531
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,799
Aren't you thankful that someone

532
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,039
didn't look at you and say,

533
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,799
yeah, I don't think the Gospel can work for them?

534
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,159
I think we'll go somewhere else.

535
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,079
They don't look like they're interested.

536
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,919
Oh, I'm thankful

537
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,799
for the power of the Gospel in my life.

538
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,879
I'm thankful for the fruit

539
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,279
that it's brought forth in my life.

540
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,759
But I'm encouraged as I read verse 6

541
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,839
as the Bible tells me,

542
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,599
listen, it doth also in you,

543
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,199
it brought forth fruit in me,

544
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,799
but it's gone not only to me,

545
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,199
it's gone into all the world.

546
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,599
And it bringeth forth fruit.

547
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,199
This morning, I hope that we'd be challenged

548
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,959
by the thought of v. 6.

549
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,639
Yes, as we are encouraged

550
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,039
by the way in which these believers

551
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,959
are described,

552
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,279
that we would be challenged

553
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,399
that the Gospel would go forward

554
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,799
and that it would bring forth fruit.

555
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,159
You say people don't want to hear.

556
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,039
Says who?

557
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,239
Says who?

558
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,119
By the way, our job has never been

559
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,839
to make people hear.

560
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,879
Our job has been to give the Gospel.

561
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,239
To just go forth

562
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,359
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

563
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,639
And we can have the faith

564
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:53,839
and the confidence

565
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,159
that it will bring forth fruit.

566
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,439
This is God's way.

567
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,079
And shall I say this morning

568
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,679
that God's way works.

569
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,359
God's way needs not improvement.

570
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,839
God's way needs not to be updated.

571
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,359
God's way just needs to be worked.

572
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,679
We just need to do it.

573
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,519
We just need to do what God said.

574
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,559
So often,

575
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:22,599
we can sit around in these little group sessions

576
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,719
and have these conversations.

577
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,399
Periodicals are written.

578
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,719
Seminars are held.

579
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,799
How to church growth.

580
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,519
Reaching a community.

581
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,479
We just need to do what God said

582
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,119
and just preach the Gospel.

583
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,119
We notice not only how they are described,

584
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,399
but I want you to notice their love displayed.

585
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,399
Notice their love displayed.

586
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,479
Go back with me to verse number four.

587
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,839
I want you to pick up on what Paul says

588
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,519
that he heard from Epaphras

589
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,279
because it's obvious that he,

590
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,199
if you look in verse number eight,

591
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:09,199
who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

592
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,439
So Epaphras was the man that God would use,

593
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,879
the servant of the Lord that God would use

594
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,919
to be a faithful minister there in Colossae,

595
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,119
but also to bring word to Paul

596
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,799
about this group of believers.

597
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,679
And Paul says in verse number four,

598
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,319
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

599
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,439
what a blessing to hear about their faith,

600
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,079
their salvation.

601
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,799
But notice what else he heard.

602
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,799
And of the love which ye have to all the saints.

603
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,199
We notice how these believers are described,

604
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:48,039
but we also notice their love displayed.

605
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,319
The love which ye have to all the saints.

606
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,039
Again, in verse number eight it says,

607
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,839
who also, speaking of Epaphras,

608
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,839
declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

609
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,519
Hold your place here in the book of Colossians

610
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,839
and turn back to the book of John

611
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,399
in the 13th chapter, if you will.

612
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:07,079
And I know that it's a familiar verse

613
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,399
of passage of Scripture.

614
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,439
In fact, on Wednesday evening,

615
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,879
as we dealt with John 14,

616
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,319
this past Wednesday evening,

617
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,439
I made some reference to John 13.

618
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,279
But I want you to notice what Jesus says.

619
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,119
Read the verses with me.

620
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,679
In John 13, in verse number 33,

621
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,159
Jesus says this.

622
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,719
Let me back up to verse 31 and catch it in context.

623
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,559
The Bible says,

624
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,599
therefore, when He was gone out,

625
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,839
Jesus said, now is the Son of Man glorified

626
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,239
and God is glorified in Him.

627
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,239
When it says there in verse number 31,

628
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,999
He was, therefore, when He was gone out,

629
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,959
that's speaking of Judas Iscariot.

630
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,079
Of course, if you look back

631
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,559
into the preceding text of Scripture,

632
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,999
you'll see how that He was the one

633
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,639
that would, of course, betray the Lord Jesus Christ.

634
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,559
And it says in verse 32,

635
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,439
if God be glorified in Him.

636
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,679
but God shall also glorify Him in Himself

637
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,599
and shall straightway glorify Him."

638
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,919
Verse 33,

639
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,079
"'Little children,

640
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,319
yet a little while I am with you.

641
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,339
Ye shall seek Me,

642
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:13,759
and as I said unto the Jews,

643
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,879
whither I go ye cannot come.

644
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:19,359
So now I say to you,

645
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,999
a new commandment I give unto you,

646
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,719
that ye love one another,

647
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,839
as I have loved you,

648
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,079
that ye also love one another.

649
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,999
By this shall all men know

650
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:45,839
that ye are My disciples,

651
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,839
if ye have love one to another.'"

652
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,679
Isn't that a powerful passage of Scripture?

653
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,479
Jesus says,

654
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,519
"'A new commandment I give unto you,

655
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,439
this new commandment is that you love one another,

656
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,559
as I have loved you.'"

657
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,239
You think about the love of God.

658
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,639
You think about the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.

659
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,079
It says that He loved Him unto the end.

660
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,039
He loves us with an unconditional love.

661
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,039
He loves us with a sacrificial love.

662
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,879
And here the Bible says that we're to love one another.

663
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,519
And then Jesus says this,

664
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:21,479
"'By this shall all men know

665
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:26,879
that ye are My disciples.'"

666
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,319
Do all men know that we are the disciples of Christ

667
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,799
by observing how we love one another?

668
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,399
I mean, we look at the church in Corinth

669
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,279
and it's full of divisions

670
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,719
and all kinds of difficulties

671
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,039
that they're dealing with.

672
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,359
I mean, I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas,

673
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,399
I'm of Apollos,

674
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,599
and there's divisions and there's carnality.

675
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,759
Surely the love of Christ

676
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,839
was not undisplayed by those believers in Corinth.

677
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,559
But Jesus said that we're to love one another.

678
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,599
He said this is the way in which men are going to know

679
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:04,279
that you're My disciples if you have love one to another.

680
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,439
The church in Thessalonica,

681
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:09,239
turn to 1 Thessalonians 4 if you will.

682
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,599
The church in Thessalonica

683
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,159
had been properly instructed

684
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:19,639
and they understood this truth of brotherly love.

685
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,399
Of loving one another

686
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,239
as Jesus commanded in John 13.

687
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,479
Paul would write to this group of believers

688
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:33,999
in 1 Thessalonians 4 in particular.

689
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,559
And I want you to notice with me

690
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,999
in v. 1 of 1 Thessalonians 4,

691
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:38,839
the Bible says,

692
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,799
"...furthermore then, we beseech you, brethren,

693
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,919
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

694
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,119
that as ye have received of us

695
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,199
how ye ought to walk and to please God,

696
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:55,159
so ye would abound more and more."

697
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:56,719
See, these believers in Thessalonica,

698
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,999
they were being instructed.

699
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,559
And specifically,

700
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
they're being taught about brotherly love

701
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,759
in verses 9 and 10.

702
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,999
If you skip over and look at those verses,

703
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,119
look at what the Bible says

704
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,439
as Paul is continuing to instruct these believers.

705
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:12,279
He says, "...but as touching brotherly love,

706
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,759
you need not that I write unto you.

707
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,679
For ye yourselves are taught of God

708
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,839
to love one another.

709
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:26,039
And indeed, ye do it toward all the brethren

710
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,279
which are in all Macedonia."

711
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,439
Isn't that a great testimony?

712
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,999
Paul says to these believers in Thessalonica,

713
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,639
he says, I want you to understand

714
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,279
that we've taught you how you've received of us

715
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,399
how you ought to walk

716
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:40,679
and how you ought to please God.

717
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,639
And it pleases God when we obey Him.

718
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,959
And as we look here in this subject

719
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,319
of brotherly love,

720
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,399
Paul says, I don't need to really write this unto you

721
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,359
because you know you're taught of God

722
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,279
to love one another,

723
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,359
and indeed, ye do it toward all the brethren

724
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,879
which are in all Macedonia.

725
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,279
What a joy and what a blessing.

726
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,999
What a great testimony

727
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,759
this church in Thessalonica had

728
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,279
with regard to brotherly love

729
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,919
and with loving one another.

730
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,959
But notice what he says.

731
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,079
But we beseech you,

732
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,159
the end of verse 10,

733
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,799
but we beseech you, brethren,

734
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:23,519
that ye increase more and more.

735
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,719
Don't get comfortable with where you are.

736
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,399
Increase more and more.

737
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,319
I mean, what a joy.

738
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,399
I often hear about folks

739
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,679
that would say of our church,

740
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,879
even though 2020 was a different kind of a year,

741
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,279
we didn't have as much opportunity for fellowship

742
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,359
and so on and so forth,

743
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,399
but I often hear over the years

744
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,839
of folks that would say

745
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,679
the genuine concern and love

746
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,319
that the believers,

747
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,479
that the members of the church

748
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,079
have one for another.

749
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,999
Praise the Lord.

750
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,039
That's how it's supposed to be.

751
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,399
Amen?

752
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:59,719
We love one another.

753
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:02,839
We love one another.

754
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:05,719
In 1 Peter 4,

755
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,559
in verse 8,

756
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,679
Peter says this,

757
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,799
and above all things,

758
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:15,079
have fervent charity among yourselves.

759
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,839
Have fervent charity among yourselves.

760
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,239
John would say in 1 John 4,

761
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,439
now understand that John was there

762
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,319
in John 13 as we read that portion of Scripture

763
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,479
where Jesus gave that new commandment.

764
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,359
The Apostle John was there.

765
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:35,919
And now many years later,

766
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:37,599
God would use the Apostle John

767
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,359
to pen the book of 1 John.

768
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,879
And in 1 John 4 and verse 7,

769
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,639
the Bible says,

770
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,479
Beloved, let us love one another,

771
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,639
for love is of God.

772
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,759
And everyone that loveth is born of God

773
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:57,079
and knoweth God.

774
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,799
Let us love one another.

775
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:00,359
Let us love one another.

776
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,999
You see, as I go back to the book of Colossians,

777
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,039
and I notice in these first few verses

778
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,879
of this book that we're going to study

779
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,999
throughout this year,

780
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,759
and we'll get through all of it,

781
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:13,079
and as we get through the book of Colossians

782
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,079
and we're introduced to these believers

783
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,439
in Colossae,

784
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,999
when we have the privilege of understanding

785
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,679
what Paul heard of them,

786
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,839
how he received from Epaphras

787
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,359
this word about these believers

788
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,599
over in this city of Colossae,

789
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,399
and he heard about their conversion.

790
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,839
He heard about their position in Christ.

791
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:34,639
He heard about the way in which

792
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,479
the Gospel got to their city

793
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:41,239
and how there were many that trusted Christ.

794
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,959
And they were there,

795
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,479
and we see how they're described,

796
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,239
but we notice what is displayed,

797
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,079
their love that is displayed.

798
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,839
He says,

799
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,639
And of the love which ye have

800
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,839
to all the saints.

801
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:55,639
To all the saints.

802
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,919
I think it's interesting that it says

803
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,839
to all the saints.

804
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,839
Because it's not supposed to be like,

805
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:01,479
well, I love them,

806
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,839
but that one over there

807
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,399
is kind of difficult to deal with.

808
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,599
They kind of rub me the wrong way.

809
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,719
Our personalities kind of throw that out.

810
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,239
We're to have love one for another.

811
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,479
By the way, we should be happy

812
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:16,399
that not everybody is exactly like we are.

813
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,159
Amen?

814
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,919
Because if everybody is exactly like you were,

815
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:21,039
if everyone is exactly like I was,

816
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,839
whoo, it'd be a rough place.

817
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,039
Honestly.

818
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,639
Sometimes I annoy myself.

819
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,279
And if everybody else was like me,

820
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:33,159
it'd be problematic.

821
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,119
God's made us all different.

822
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,159
We're to love all the saints.

823
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,999
The Bible says that Paul heard of their faith,

824
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,719
but it also shows us of their love

825
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,479
that was displayed.

826
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,599
And of the love which ye have

827
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,319
to all the saints.

828
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:54,559
How are we doing?

829
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,639
How are we doing?

830
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,319
I hope that we're following

831
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,919
the instruction of Christ in John 13.

832
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:09,119
I hope that when people would observe us,

833
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,439
they'd say, man, they love each other.

834
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,719
They love each other.

835
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,239
And it's genuine.

836
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,879
Notice with me,

837
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,359
not only how these folks in Colossae

838
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,279
are described,

839
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,119
not only do we notice their love being displayed,

840
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,839
but I notice in these first few verses

841
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,079
of Colossians 1,

842
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,879
I notice that they had been discipled.

843
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,759
They'd been discipled.

844
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:39,199
Notice with me in verse 7,

845
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,599
two phrases in this particular verse of Scripture.

846
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,439
The Bible says,

847
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:47,719
as ye also learned of Epaphras.

848
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,479
Now, Paul calls him our dear fellow servant.

849
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,719
You understand that Paul and Epaphras,

850
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,639
they have the opportunity.

851
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,959
As you read the book of Philemon,

852
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:00,679
you'll see some reference to Epaphras

853
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,679
there in the book of Philemon.

854
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,679
We won't take time to turn there,

855
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,799
but you see that Paul refers to Epaphras

856
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,679
as our dear fellow servant.

857
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,199
But you notice that the Bible says,

858
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,879
as ye, speaking of the believers in Colossae,

859
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,599
as ye also learned.

860
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,519
That's the key word I want you to focus upon that.

861
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,119
They have learned of Epaphras.

862
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,999
Notice what it says,

863
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:26,279
who is for you a faithful minister of Christ.

864
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,959
Now, someone that is a faithful minister,

865
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:33,279
there's some criteria that would go along

866
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,679
with that terminology.

867
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,039
You understand that there's a reference

868
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,079
to a good minister, a faithful minister.

869
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,279
Listen, Paul was not just throwing out

870
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:45,919
accolades to Epaphras.

871
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,639
This is the Word of God.

872
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,839
What made this man a faithful minister?

873
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,399
What made him a good minister?

874
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,399
Well, hold your place here in Colossians.

875
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:58,039
Turn to the book of 1 Timothy, if you will.

876
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,559
I'm glad that you asked the question this morning,

877
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,959
and you'd be interested.

878
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:05,239
in knowing why is Epaphras,

879
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,319
why is it that he's referred to

880
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,439
as a faithful minister of Christ?

881
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:15,879
Well, Paul says this in 1 Timothy 4.

882
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:18,599
I won't take the time to read the first five verses,

883
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,499
but I would encourage you to read

884
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:22,839
as the Bible gives us some interesting truth

885
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,659
with regard to the description

886
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,399
of the latter times

887
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,059
in which we're living, no doubt.

888
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,939
But notice verse 6 of 1 Timothy 4.

889
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,479
If thou... who's he speaking to?

890
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:35,719
He's speaking to Timothy.

891
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,659
That's who the book is written to.

892
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:41,979
He says, if thou put the brethren

893
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:45,399
in remembrance of these things,

894
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:49,439
thou shalt be a good minister

895
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,679
of Jesus Christ,

896
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,839
nourished up in the words of faith

897
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,339
and of good doctrine

898
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:00,239
whereunto thou hast attained.

899
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,619
The Apostle Paul says, listen,

900
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,459
you need to do these things,

901
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,419
and as you would do these things,

902
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:09,219
and as you would put them,

903
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,259
the people that you've been called to lead

904
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:12,219
and minister to,

905
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,819
as you would put them in remembrance

906
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,899
of these things,

907
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,299
then you would be acknowledged

908
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:21,119
as being a good minister of Jesus Christ.

909
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,179
We understand that Paul gives instruction.

910
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,139
He does not use the specific terminology,

911
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,379
but in 2 Timothy 4,

912
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:28,559
when he says to Timothy,

913
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,699
I charge thee therefore before God

914
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,299
and the Lord Jesus Christ,

915
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:34,419
who shall judge the quick and the dead

916
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,299
at His appearing in His kingdom,

917
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:37,539
preach the Word,

918
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,099
be instant in season, out of season,

919
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,259
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering

920
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:42,979
in doctrine, for the time will come

921
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:44,859
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

922
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,339
but after their own lusts shall they

923
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,819
heap to themselves teachers

924
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:50,319
having itching ears.

925
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,479
They shall turn away their ears from the truth

926
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:54,059
and shall be turned unto fables.

927
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:56,539
But watch thou in all things,

928
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:57,799
endure afflictions,

929
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,799
do the work of an evangelist,

930
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:04,259
make full proof of thy ministry.

931
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,559
Paul says to Timothy,

932
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,859
you're going to be a good servant,

933
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,019
a good minister, a faithful minister,

934
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:11,059
preach the Word.

935
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,639
Peter says this to the individuals

936
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,959
that he's writing to in 1 Peter 5.

937
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,599
We find that the focus

938
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,719
of this particular few verses

939
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,119
to look at what we're focusing on here

940
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,639
this morning in this passage of Scripture

941
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:29,679
is that he's speaking to the ministers,

942
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,099
to the pastors, to the leaders of the church.

943
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:36,759
Notice with me in verse 1 of 1 Peter 5.

944
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:39,939
The elders which are among you I exhort,

945
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:41,139
who am also an elder

946
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,139
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ

947
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:44,759
and also a partaker of the glory

948
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,559
that shall be revealed.

949
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,519
Notice what he tells these elders,

950
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,399
these pastors, these leaders,

951
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:53,659
these spiritual leaders.

952
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,499
He says,

953
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:59,379
feed the flock of God which is among you,

954
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,099
taking the oversight thereof,

955
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:03,239
not by constraint, but willingly,

956
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,679
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,

957
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,559
neither as being lords over God's heritage,

958
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,159
but being in samples to the flock.

959
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:10,919
Notice this,

960
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:13,579
and when the chief shepherd shall appear,

961
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:16,179
ye shall receive a crown of glory

962
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:20,019
that fadeth not away.

963
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,219
Now, verse 4 encourages me

964
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:23,239
as a pastor,

965
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:26,099
as one that would take this responsibility

966
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:27,899
that has been placed upon me,

967
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,499
being called into the ministry

968
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:30,859
and God enabling me.

969
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,459
The Bible says that when the chief shepherd shall appear,

970
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:36,319
I'm thankful that the chief shepherd's coming back.

971
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,139
But the Bible says,

972
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:38,539
ye shall receive a crown of glory

973
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:40,019
that fadeth not away.

974
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:42,219
Can I say that everyone that calls themselves a pastor,

975
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,859
everyone that fills the office of elders,

976
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,619
is not going to receive this reward?

977
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,519
Why? Because they're not feeding the flock of God.

978
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,139
They're not being a faithful minister.

979
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:54,139
They're not being a good minister.

980
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,579
I long to please God.

981
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,859
I long to be a faithful minister,

982
00:43:58,859 --> 00:43:59,859
a good minister,

983
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:01,899
one who feeds the flock of God,

984
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,459
that fulfills the responsibility,

985
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:06,299
that would have the testimony of Epaphras

986
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:09,179
here in Colossians 1 and verse 7.

987
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,099
A faithful minister of Christ.

988
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,219
But we're noticing how they had been discipled.

989
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,539
They had been discipled, no doubt, by Epaphras.

990
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,339
This faithful minister of Christ.

991
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:24,899
We understand that the Great Commission is our mission.

992
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:28,699
The Great Commission is our mission.

993
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:33,019
As a local New Testament church,

994
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:36,579
we have our marching orders.

995
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:38,979
We're not waiting for instruction from Heaven

996
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:40,579
on what we're supposed to do.

997
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,459
He's already given us the instruction

998
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,979
in the Word of God.

999
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:46,819
The Great Commission is our mission.

1000
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:50,619
Oh, we need to have focus upon what our mission is.

1001
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:53,099
What happens with businesses,

1002
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,219
with corporations over the years,

1003
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,699
you can see where they lose their focus

1004
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,299
of what their mission is.

1005
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:02,299
Most companies, most corporations,

1006
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:06,819
entities, they have a mission statement.

1007
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:09,579
What's the purpose of their mission statement?

1008
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,339
To communicate what their purpose is.

1009
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,059
To communicate what their mission is.

1010
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:17,219
At times, if they're not careful,

1011
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:21,179
they can get distracted, detoured.

1012
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,699
They can lose focus of what their real mission is.

1013
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:28,019
Can I tell you that the enemy wants to distract us

1014
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:31,099
as the people of God from what our mission is?

1015
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:34,579
He wants us to get caught up in all kinds of things.

1016
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,339
He wants us to get detoured and distracted

1017
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:40,779
by all sorts of things that are going on in our world today.

1018
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,739
But we must refocus upon what our mission is.

1019
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,299
And the mission for the local church

1020
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:47,659
is the Great Commission.

1021
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:51,019
Notice that the Great Commission,

1022
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,019
as we would speak about it,

1023
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:55,299
we would understand that discipleship

1024
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:59,259
is a vital part of this mission.

1025
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,659
I'd invite you to look over to Matthew 28

1026
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,779
as we conclude this morning.

1027
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:08,179
We notice how these folks are described.

1028
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,139
We notice their love that's displayed,

1029
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:15,019
but we also take note that they had been discipled.

1030
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,579
The Great Commission is our mission,

1031
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,139
and discipleship is a vital part of that mission.

1032
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:21,779
In Matthew 28 and verse 18,

1033
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,739
Jesus came and spake unto them.

1034
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,979
This is after His death, after His burial,

1035
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:27,459
after His resurrection,

1036
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,979
just prior to the ascension of Jesus Christ.

1037
00:46:29,979 --> 00:46:32,499
He's giving instruction to His people,

1038
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,259
His followers, and He says,

1039
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,579
all power is given unto Me

1040
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:38,859
in heaven and in earth.

1041
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:39,699
Notice this,

1042
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:46,379
Go ye therefore and teach all nations.

1043
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:47,339
What are we to teach them?

1044
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,539
The Gospel.

1045
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:53,619
The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

1046
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,539
Baptizing them in the name of the Father

1047
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,739
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

1048
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:01,219
Baptism always follows salvation.

1049
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,459
We do not believe in infant baptism.

1050
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:08,019
We believe in believer's baptism by immersion.

1051
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,299
After you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

1052
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:12,339
as your personal Savior,

1053
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:15,779
that you follow Him in believer's baptism.

1054
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:17,659
It pictures the death, burial, and resurrection

1055
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:18,739
of Jesus Christ.

1056
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,819
It shows that we're to be dead to the old self

1057
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,179
and rise to walk in newness of life.

1058
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,739
See, there is a proper mode of baptism,

1059
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:30,499
but there's also a proper candidate for baptism.

1060
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:32,499
Remember the Ethiopian eunuch

1061
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:36,059
when he says there in Acts 8,

1062
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:39,779
here's water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?

1063
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:42,299
And I'm so thankful that Philip was able to say

1064
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:44,259
with great confidence that if you believe

1065
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:46,459
with all thine heart, thou mayest.

1066
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:47,739
He said, I believe!

1067
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,099
And he said, stop the chariot,

1068
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,139
let's get this guy baptized, amen?

1069
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,739
So the Great Commission teaching all nations,

1070
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,419
giving the Gospel.

1071
00:47:56,419 --> 00:47:57,939
Number two, baptizing.

1072
00:47:57,939 --> 00:47:59,699
Number three, verse number 20,

1073
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,819
teaching them.

1074
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:02,459
Who's them?

1075
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,179
That's the converted people.

1076
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,779
The people that have been saved.

1077
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,499
The people that have been baptized.

1078
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:10,739
Teaching them, notice what the Word of God says,

1079
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:14,899
to observe all things,

1080
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:18,179
whatsoever I have commanded you.

1081
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,459
And lo, I am with you always,

1082
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:22,739
even unto the end of the world.

1083
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:26,579
Amen.

1084
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,059
Far too often,

1085
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:34,099
the Great Commission stops at verse 19.

1086
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,299
Discipleship ministry of a local church

1087
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:40,419
is imperative.

1088
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:43,219
It's key.

1089
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:45,339
That believers are discipled,

1090
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,139
that they're taught to observe all things

1091
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:51,219
whatsoever I have commanded you.

1092
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,979
It's the responsibility of the leadership

1093
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:55,819
of the church to provide discipleship,

1094
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,659
that teaching.

1095
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:59,859
Oh, discipleship happens from the pulpit

1096
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:02,659
as the Word of God is taught and preached.

1097
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:04,659
Discipleship happens in classrooms.

1098
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:07,539
Discipleship happens having coffee.

1099
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:10,499
Discipleship can happen in a number of ways.

1100
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:13,339
As the Word of God is given and instructed,

1101
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:16,699
and a person, an individual that has been saved

1102
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:21,299
sits and hears and receives the instruction.

1103
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:23,139
And as they receive that instruction,

1104
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:24,779
they're to be doers of the Word,

1105
00:49:24,779 --> 00:49:26,739
not hearers only.

1106
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,459
And we see how the Word of God

1107
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:29,579
would spread forth

1108
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:35,059
and how the cause of Christ would move forward.

1109
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,939
I'm so thankful that Jesus has promised

1110
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:39,659
to be with us as we go to fulfill

1111
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:42,419
this Great Commission.

1112
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:46,419
But as I look at the church in Colossae,

1113
00:49:46,419 --> 00:49:50,099
I notice that they had been discipled.

1114
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,539
They had been taught.

1115
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:53,699
As you also learned of Epaphras,

1116
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,299
our dear fellow servant,

1117
00:49:55,299 --> 00:50:00,299
who was for you a faithful minister of Christ.

1118
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:02,019
I'm thankful that Epaphras taught

1119
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:08,939
Word of God. But you know, these believers had to show up to receive the

1120
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:15,099
instruction. Amen? He could have discipleship class. Hey, we're gonna have

1121
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:20,739
discipleship class on Tuesday night at whatever time. Who's gonna show up?

1122
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:30,539
There's a desire to learn, a desire to grow. I want to know the Lord Jesus

1123
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:37,979
Christ. I want to be discipled. I want to be instructed. This morning, as we're

1124
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:42,619
introduced to these believers in Colossae, we learn a little bit by way of

1125
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:45,779
introduction of where the city was and some of the things that were going on.

1126
00:50:45,779 --> 00:50:53,299
But I want you to notice how they were described. Saints. Faithful brethren. I

1127
00:50:53,299 --> 00:51:00,179
want you to notice their love that was displayed. How that they loved all the

1128
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:05,699
saints. And then I want you to notice that they were discipled. They were

1129
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:12,939
growing. They're being taught. Oh, that God would help us to be encouraged by

1130
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:17,459
reading about this church in Colossae. Oh, that God would help us to be challenged

1131
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:24,499
in our own walk with Christ. Have you been saved? Perhaps there's one that's

1132
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,899
tuned in this morning that's never trusted Christ as their Savior. You

1133
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:32,139
couldn't be referred to as a saint or a faithful brethren, but today is the day

1134
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:38,099
of salvation. The gospel brings forth fruit. Jesus died for you. He was buried

1135
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,859
in a borrowed tomb and he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave. And

1136
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:44,739
the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

1137
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:51,339
Maybe today you need to be saved. This morning we're challenged by the love for

1138
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:55,659
the saints, the love for the brethren. Maybe this morning we're challenged by

1139
00:51:55,659 --> 00:52:02,059
our discipleship. How are we growing? Are we involved in discipleship? Are we

1140
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:09,859
eager to learn, to be discipled, to be taught the Word of God? The saints at

1141
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:14,939
Colossae, let us pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you

1142
00:52:14,939 --> 00:52:20,619
for the book of Colossians. Thank you for this group of believers in Colossae where

1143
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:26,779
the gospel reached and souls were saved. It brings forth fruit. The gospel does.

1144
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:34,939
We're challenged by that truth. We're challenged to give the gospel, to preach

1145
00:52:34,939 --> 00:52:39,579
the gospel. I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can over

1146
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:44,019
the next few moments of invitation. God, help us to be doers of the Word and not

1147
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:47,859
hearers only. If there's one that needs to be saved, I pray that today would be

1148
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:50,859
the day of their salvation. The Holy Spirit of God would convict them of

1149
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:56,339
their sin, of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. God, I pray that

1150
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:06,419
you'd help us to long to be like thee, to know thee, to grow in our walk with thee.

1151
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:09,779
Have your will and way in these few moments, for it's in Christ's name we

1152
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:13,179
pray. Amen.
