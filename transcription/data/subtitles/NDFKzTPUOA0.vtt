WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
And turn in the word of God the book of Colossians and we'll be studying this year through this book as we had our introductory

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:12.399
Message last week looking at our theme from Colossians chapter 2 in verse number 10

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.700
When paul said to these that he's writing to in colossi and ye are complete

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.079
In him complete in christ complete in him

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:28.659
And as we dig into this book in the first chapter, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 8 this morning colossians

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:31.860
Chapter number 1 looking at verses 1 through 8

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.400
If you are taking notes in that new sermon notebook that you picked up yesterday

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.299
you will

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.259
Want to title the message this morning to the saints

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.819
At colossi to the saints

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.779
At colossi the bible says this in verse number one of colossians 1 paul

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.779
An apostle of jesus christ by the will of god

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Timotheus our brother

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.959
And so we find right in the beginning of this book that god gives us the human penman to the book of colossians

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.819
And that being the apostle paul you understand that he says an apostle of jesus christ

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:14.580
Notice what it says by the will of god and the apostle paul understood that he was what he was by the grace of god

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660
He understood the calling

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.120
That god had placed upon his life and he understood

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.559
Uh the great responsibility that he had

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:30.199
Uh, and what a joy and what a blessing to see a man who was yielded to the holy spirit of god

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.000
a man that was used to cause the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.559
Instruct people and to uh be involved in the cause of christ moving forward

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440
The bible says in timotheus

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.519
Our brother, we know that paul had a close relationship with timothy

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:52.360
Often even as you find he would refer to timothy as being his own son in the faith and you understand

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.080
They traveled and journeyed together. They ministered alongside one another and paul

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:59.699
invested in timothy and paul

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.199
instructed timothy and uh

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:08.919
We find that of course the bible would help us to understand the human penman and the human authorship

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.199
We understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and this is the word of god

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.559
But god would use paul humanly speaking to pen these words

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.240
The bible says in verse number two of colossians one to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.779
The saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colossi

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.520
Grace be unto you and peace from god our father

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.119
and

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:38.520
The lord jesus christ we will go down through verse number eight this morning in our study

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:45.419
But as we kind of give some background information to this church here this group of believers in the city of colossi

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.100
We would understand geographically that the city of colossi was located roughly a hundred miles east of ephesus

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.880
and as we would begin to think about the geography and we'd understand some things and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.119
with regard to the city of colossi this ancient city that was

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Uh very

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.199
Involved in trade and what have you at the time of the writing?

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.839
As paul is now addressing this group of believers. We'd understand that the

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.559
City had kind of already

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.440
Had its its highest days if you will it was a city in decline because of some

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.320
Changes with trade routes and so on and so forth, but we find that this city

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.940
Was was roughly a hundred miles east of ephesus

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.020
We understand when we think about the geographical location

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.139
Of this particular city of colossi that paul spent an extended period of time in ephesus

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.679
and the bible would tell us that during

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.479
the time that paul was in ephesus if you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.720
Hold your place here in colossians and turn to the book of acts in the 19th chapter

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.600
And god is giving us some information here

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.240
In the book of acts with regard to the missionary journey and all that god would use paul and those that accompanied him

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.720
to accomplish for the cause of christ

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:07.179
The bible would tell us that while he spent this extended period of time in ephesus

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.160
That the gospel threat spread throughout asia

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.240
in fact

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.579
You will understand and keep your place there in acts 19, but you'll understand that in acts chapter number 16

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.119
when they were seeking the will of god with regard to

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:29.320
Taking the gospel forward the bible tells us that they were forbidden to the holy ghost

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.000
To preach the word in asia in acts 16 in verse number six

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:40.619
Though they had endeavored and desired to go to that region and it was when they were in ephesus as it's recorded in acts 19

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:48.059
Notice in verse number 10 the bible says this and this continued by the space of two years

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.500
What was it that continued the teaching of the word of god?

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:57.980
The instruction that paul was giving to those and the bible says so that all they

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.579
So that all they which dwelt in asia, excuse me heard the word of the lord jesus

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:08.299
both jews and

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:09.739
greeks now

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:16.380
As we notice acts 19 in verse number 10 and the bible tells us so that all they which dwelt in asia

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:21.200
Heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks and we understand

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:25.260
That when the bible refers to here in acts 19 in verse number 10 to asia

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.619
Is speaking about that region that we would refer to as asia minor and we'd understand that the gospel was going forth

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:40.380
That paul was instructing the believers there in ephesus and people were hearing the gospel and they were taking the word of god

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.260
uh into their communities and into their

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:47.200
neighborhoods if you will and they were spreading forth the gospel

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:53.100
And the bible tells us that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks now

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:58.299
That's encouraging to me because that's the model that god has set forth. That is the plan

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.540
That jesus has established that the gospel would go forth into all the world and we find

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:09.359
That with colossi being a hundred miles roughly to the east of ephesus

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:15.579
That it is certainly possible that during the earthly ministry of the apostle paul in ephesus though

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.079
He himself never traveled to colossi

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.140
That we would understand that the gospel spread forth

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:28.859
And no doubt people in the city of colossi had the privilege of hearing the gospel

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.059
As I mentioned just a moment ago the apostle paul never personally ministered in the city of colossi

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.299
He did not know these believers

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.980
personally

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.519
In fact, if you read verse number one of chapter two the book of colossians

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.220
The bible says for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:53.339
At laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:59.579
The flesh the apostle paul never ministered personally in colossi. He did not know

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:03.920
By name the individuals that he's writing to in the book of colossians

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:10.299
It's interesting for as we look at other books of the bible that god would use the apostle paul to write

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.540
There are many times in which you see the personal influence and you find

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:17.179
The names of individuals that are

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.640
Referenced and you can go back to the book of acts and you can read about the time and ministry

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.839
Of the apostle paul amongst those very people that he's writing back to and that's not the case here with the book of colossians

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:32.459
however

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:37.279
As you read the book of colossians, you really get the sense you understand

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:40.040
the love and

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.500
Concern that paul had for each of these believers

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:51.559
Now that's encouraging to me. In fact, it is a challenge to me to see how the apostle paul had such

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.200
uh, just a desire

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:59.399
Uh for these believers in colossi believers that he never even met

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:05.480
But believers that he heard about their testimony. He received from epaphras this

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:13.179
Uh this report this testimony and paul has this love and genuine concern for these believers

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:17.500
And you find that as you read through and study the book of colossians

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.779
There will be some names that you recognize

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.399
Apaphras is one of them and we'll mention that as we go through the message even this morning

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.880
But as you get into the end of the book of colossians, you'll see a couple of additional names

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:34.599
In which you will recognize from some of the other writings of paul

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.640
uh and and some of the names of the individuals that are referenced in the book of colossians and so

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.919
As we look here and we think about this man epaphras the bible tells us

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:47.719
That he was a faithful minister

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.719
and

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:55.739
The individual that informed paul about the group of believers here in colossi

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.760
Look down at verse number seven in colossians one. The bible says as you also learned

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:06.859
Of epaphras our dear fellow servant who was for you a faithful minister

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:09.080
of christ

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.080
As we begin to think about the

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.380
geography if you will

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.979
Of colossi you begin to think about the way in which paul learned about this group of believers in colossi

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.799
It was through the testimony of epaphras that would bring this report

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.700
And paul would be informed and he would be aware that there's a group of believers in this city in colossi

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.659
that were

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:38.919
Assembling and growing and serving and what a blessing that must have been to the heart of the apostle paul

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.239
Unfortunately as we find throughout the history of the church

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:48.059
Here even in colossi we would find as we read through the book of colossians

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.859
That false teaching had crept in we understand the bible teaches us that there will be false teachers

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.840
We understand today that as we live in 2021

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:00.859
That there are many false

00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:02.659
false teachers that abound.

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:05.279
It is so vital that we understand

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.759
that we are settled and grounded

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.439
in the truth of this Book.

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:11.279
How thankful we ought to be

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.239
as New Testament believers

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:16.639
that we have the complete canon of Scripture

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:19.039
and that we can go to the Word of God

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.959
and we can understand what

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.719
thus saith the Lord.

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.799
But these believers in Colossae,

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:26.319
there were some false teachers

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:27.999
that had crept in.

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.079
Now you understand.

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:32.399
When false teachers come into an assembly,

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.879
they do not wear a name tag

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.279
that says, I'm a false teacher.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.079
They do not announce broadly

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:40.879
to the people that they're seeking

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.599
to come in and assemble with

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:46.719
and influence that they are false teachers.

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:49.039
No, as Jude would say it,

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:52.319
they creep in unawares.

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:54.799
They try to fly under the radar, if you will.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:58.719
We have often said during the time of ministry here

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:01.399
that God has given me that false teachers,

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.879
one of the ways in which they operate

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:09.039
is that they will use the same words that we use.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:12.599
They will use our vocabulary.

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:16.039
The problem is that they have a different definition.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.119
They mean something entirely different

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:20.399
than we would mean by the very same words

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:21.559
that we would speak.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.759
And it's so vitally important

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.999
that we are so grounded in the truth of this Word.

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:29.239
It was an unfortunate set of events

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:31.399
that led to this false teaching

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.639
creeping into the church in Colossae.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:35.319
But how thankful I am

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:38.079
that the Lord would use His Word

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.239
to correct the false teaching

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:44.199
and to properly instruct the believers in Colossae.

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:46.479
I'm thankful that Epaphras was there,

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:48.759
a faithful minister of Christ.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.599
Oh, what a blessing it is.

00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:53.679
Even last year as we studied through the book of Hebrews

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.359
and we mentioned in Hebrews 13,

00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:59.359
those 10 things that we ought to be thankful for,

00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:00.959
that we ought to rejoice in.

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.719
And we mentioned about spiritual leaders

00:12:03.719 --> 00:12:05.479
and how thankful we should be

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:07.559
for those that would be called,

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:11.919
that would be referred to as a faithful minister of Christ.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:13.799
Someone who would stand up

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:17.719
and faithfully proclaim the truth of the Word of God

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:19.519
without compromise.

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.959
The Bible says that those that are preachers,

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:23.039
those that are pastors,

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:24.279
that were to preach the Word,

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.039
the instant in-season, out-of-season,

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:27.879
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:29.919
with all long-suffering in doctrine.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:31.879
We understand that the time will come

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:34.039
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:37.119
but our responsibility is to preach the Word.

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:38.719
It may not be popular.

00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:42.319
In fact, we're finding the closer we get

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:43.679
to the return of our Savior,

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:46.519
that it's becoming less and less popular.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.919
But oh, I'm thankful for Epaphras,

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:50.959
who was a faithful minister of Christ,

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:55.919
who was engaged in helping these believers in God

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:59.439
through allowing Epaphras to communicate with Paul,

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:02.239
would then, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.639
use Paul to send this letter,

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.719
the book of Colossians,

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:10.599
to properly instruct,

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.679
to correct that false teaching

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:15.479
and properly instruct these believers.

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:18.679
Oh, how thankful I am for the Word of God.

00:13:18.719 --> 00:13:21.399
I'm thankful that the Word of God,

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.719
as I've referenced already this morning,

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.799
that passage in 2 Timothy 3,

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:29.799
that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:30.639
The Bible says,

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:34.519
and is profitable for doctrine,

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:37.039
for reproof, for correction,

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:39.559
for instruction in righteousness,

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:42.199
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:46.799
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:49.079
I know I've said it often.

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:50.479
It's worth repeating.

00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:54.519
We need more of this book, not less.

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:58.599
There's a popular movement within our world today

00:13:58.599 --> 00:14:01.679
of we need less preaching.

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:02.879
We need less teaching.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:05.279
We need more entertainment.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.599
No, we need the Word of God.

00:14:07.599 --> 00:14:09.919
In your life, in my life personally,

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:12.359
I need more of God's Word.

00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.999
We've just now entered into the second week

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:16.119
of a brand new year.

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:18.679
I hope that you've made the decision

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:21.599
that in 2021 that you're going to read the Bible

00:14:21.599 --> 00:14:23.799
more than you did in 2020.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.159
That you're going to dig in.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.879
That you're going to allow the Word of God

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:28.959
to impact and influence your life

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:34.959
to have its work and its way in your life.

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:38.159
We need more of God's Word, not less.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:39.079
Someone said this,

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:40.959
that thumbprints in the Bible

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:44.199
are more important than footprints on the moon.

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:45.719
And I like it.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.279
Because we need the Word of God.

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.079
Let me clarify, I am not simply saying

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:53.359
that you read it as fast as you can

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:57.039
to say I read the Bible ten times this year.

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:59.479
If you could, that's wonderful.

00:14:59.479 --> 00:15:01.079
I endeavor annually, personally,

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.079
to read the Bible through several times.

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:05.119
But I would say to you,

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:08.839
as I've said to many people personally,

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:12.959
the quality is more important than the quantity.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.359
To truly allow the Word of God to get into you.

00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:18.279
That we truly determine that we're going to be

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.759
doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.159
In this book of Colossians,

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.159
when it was originally sent

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.519
from the Apostle Paul to this group of believers,

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:30.839
oh, I'm sure it was a great encouragement

00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:32.919
as we'll find as we read through

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:34.959
and study through this book,

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:37.199
to hear how Paul,

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:39.759
though they may have heard of him,

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.879
they never met him personally,

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:44.079
how he says, I'm praying for you.

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:46.039
And then he tells them how he's praying for them.

00:15:46.039 --> 00:15:47.719
I mean, just the encouragement

00:15:47.719 --> 00:15:49.399
that these believers would receive.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:52.359
But then the instruction that they would receive

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:54.559
to correct that false teaching.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:56.479
I'm so thankful that God's given us

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.000
the Word of God.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.759
I believe that these original recipients,

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:05.000
the day in which they originally received

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.639
this letter that we refer to

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:10.239
as the book of Colossians,

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:12.279
that there was excitement.

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.839
That there was joy.

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:17.279
I mean, this was a big deal

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:20.879
that we've received a letter from Paul,

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.639
the Apostle.

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:24.039
I believe they were excited about it.

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:27.000
They understood that it was the Word of God.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.159
They're going to set it aside.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.639
I'll get to it later.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.039
No.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:37.079
They want to know the content of this letter.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:41.319
I believe that it was impactful in their lives.

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:43.639
As we notice as we study through

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:47.799
this first several verses of Colossians 1,

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:50.719
I want you to notice with me,

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.119
number one, how they were described.

00:16:53.119 --> 00:16:55.279
Notice how these believers

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.559
are described for us.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.559
The Bible tells us that Paul's writing to them

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:01.559
in verse 1, but then notice the description

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:02.919
in verse 2.

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:05.359
The Bible says, to the saints.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.279
To the saints.

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.119
We understand.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.679
We've even titled the message this morning

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:12.199
to the saints at Colossae.

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.279
It will say, and faithful brethren in Christ,

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:17.239
which are at Colossae.

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:20.239
I'm so thankful for this word saint.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.039
I would say to you this morning,

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.959
even as I mentioned a few moments ago

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.399
by way of introduction,

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:27.239
that there are those today

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:30.279
within the broad category of Christendom

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:32.239
that would use the word saint,

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:34.959
but they have a different definition.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
They mean something entirely different

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.959
than what the Bible means

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:41.919
when the Bible uses the word saint.

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:43.199
The word saint.

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:44.959
It means holy one.

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.439
It means those who have been saved.

00:17:47.439 --> 00:17:49.119
It means those who have been redeemed

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:50.319
by the blood of the Lamb.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:54.000
A real good definition for saint is this.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.719
One who is in Christ

00:17:56.719 --> 00:18:00.359
and in whom Christ dwells.

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:01.439
A saint.

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:04.479
One who is in Christ

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:08.199
and in whom Christ dwells.

00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:09.359
We find that Paul,

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:11.719
as he would write to the believers in Ephesus,

00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:13.039
that he says to them

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.879
in v. 1 of Ephesians 1,

00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:16.639
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:17.919
by the will of God,

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:20.799
to the saints, which are at Ephesus.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.119
When he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:25.199
another church in which he had

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:27.759
the opportunity to minister to

00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:29.559
and had the privilege of being able

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:31.519
to serve alongside,

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:34.359
he says here, Paul and Timotheus,

00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:35.799
the servants of Jesus Christ,

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.519
to all the saints in Christ Jesus

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:39.919
which are at Philippi

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.679
with the bishops and deacons.

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:44.719
And then here in Colossians 1,

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:46.479
in v. 2, to the saints

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:48.119
and faithful brethren in Christ

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:50.440
which are at Colossae.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.159
Oh, I'm so thankful for the recognition

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:55.959
at the very beginning of this book

00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:58.000
that we'd understand that Paul

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.799
is writing to believers.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.159
He's writing to people that have been born again.

00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:03.399
To people that are saved.

00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:06.119
They're referred to as saints.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:08.279
One who is in Christ,

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:11.000
in whom Christ dwells.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.839
Oh, what a blessing.

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:14.359
I want you to notice that not only

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.200
does he call them saints,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.719
but he says, and faithful brethren.

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:21.519
Faithful brethren.

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:24.239
I love the description

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:26.880
of these believers in Colossae.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.799
Saints and faithful brethren.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.519
Faithfulness is to be commended.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.760
It seems as if as we would go through life

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.880
and we'd understand various influences

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.799
of our culture and our society,

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:44.599
that it would seem as if by and large

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:47.039
the importance of faithfulness

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.559
has kind of not been where it needs to be.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.919
But I would submit to you that as the people of God,

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:57.239
that faithfulness is to be commended.

00:19:57.239 --> 00:20:00.119
We understand that God says

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.079
faithfulness.

00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:04.379
This is required that stewards,

00:20:04.379 --> 00:20:06.339
1 Corinthians 4 and verse 2,

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.359
that it's required in stewards

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:11.299
that a man be found faithful.

00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:13.399
We understand that Solomon

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:15.139
in the book of Proverbs

00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:18.859
would express the value of faithfulness.

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:21.059
The Word of God is full of examples

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:22.659
of both men and women

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:24.939
who were faithful.

00:20:24.939 --> 00:20:26.939
They were faithful.

00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:30.939
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.739
He is faithful.

00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:33.879
In fact, we sing,

00:20:33.879 --> 00:20:37.579
great is thy faithfulness.

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:39.879
You begin to think about the faithfulness of God.

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:42.559
I hope this morning that when your mind

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.619
would reflect upon the faithfulness of God

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:46.439
that you'd be encouraged

00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:48.359
to know that our God is trustworthy

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:50.479
and dependable.

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:53.279
God is faithful.

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:56.419
But we find that these believers in Colossae,

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:58.159
that they are being referred to

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:01.439
as being faithful brethren.

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:03.279
Faithful.

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:04.879
I'm thankful for the faithfulness

00:21:04.879 --> 00:21:06.999
of the people in Colossae.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.999
The way in which they're described.

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:09.619
Paul says,

00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:12.759
grace be unto you and peace from God our Father

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:14.919
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:17.159
Notice in v. 3 of Colossians 1,

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:20.199
we give thanks to God

00:21:20.199 --> 00:21:22.719
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:26.159
praying always for you.

00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:28.799
We are going to use v. 3

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:29.919
in a future message

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:31.599
to begin to look at the prayer

00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:34.119
that Paul records really

00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:36.119
for these believers in Colossae.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:38.119
In v. 9-14, he lets them know

00:21:38.119 --> 00:21:40.719
how he's praying for them specifically.

00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:42.799
But what a joy when you see

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:45.439
how the Apostle Paul is saying

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:47.719
to these believers in Colossae

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.279
that he is thankful for them,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:50.439
that he's praying for them.

00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:51.919
Notice in v. 4,

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:56.159
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:00.399
and of the love which ye have to all the saints.

00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:05.039
Paul heard about their faith in Christ Jesus.

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.719
He heard about their conversion.

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:09.039
He heard that they had been born again.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.199
As you continue to look,

00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:12.519
you find that the Bible would reveal to us

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:14.119
how the Gospel got there

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:15.639
and they believed.

00:22:15.639 --> 00:22:17.159
It says in v. 5,

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:20.279
for the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven,

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:23.239
whereof ye heard before

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:26.079
in the word of the truth of the Gospel,

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.679
notice where it says in v. 6,

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.119
which is come unto you

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:34.479
as it is in all the world,

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.239
and bringeth forth fruit

00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:37.919
as it doth also in you,

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:39.639
since the day ye heard of it

00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:44.079
and knew the grace of God in truth.

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:47.039
I'm so thankful for the testimony

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.959
of these believers in Colossae

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:50.799
for the way in which they are described.

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.759
I'm thankful for their salvation.

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:54.639
I'm thankful that one day,

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.199
I mean, we'll have the opportunity

00:22:56.199 --> 00:22:59.799
of seeing these believers in Colossae

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:01.639
that were redeemed.

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:02.479
They've been saved.

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:05.159
The Bible says that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:23:05.159 --> 00:23:07.799
And what a joy for all of eternity

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:11.879
to be with the saved, the believers.

00:23:11.879 --> 00:23:13.439
It says that it's come unto you.

00:23:13.439 --> 00:23:14.599
What has come unto you?

00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:16.679
The word of the truth of the Gospel.

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.799
Notice where it says,

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:22.359
as it is in all the world.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.879
The job of New Testament believers

00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:26.679
is to preach the Gospel to every creature,

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:28.599
to go into all the world

00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:31.119
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:32.639
I'm thankful that the Bible

00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:33.919
would rehearse for us

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:35.679
and provide us with a record

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:37.199
of how the Word of God,

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:38.919
the Gospel of Jesus Christ

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:40.039
went in all the world.

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:41.759
Notice where it says in v. 6,

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:43.359
right in the middle of the verse,

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:47.239
"...bringeth forth fruit."

00:23:47.239 --> 00:23:49.319
You know, this is a great promise

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:52.079
that we need to hold dear to our hearts.

00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:53.479
The Bible says that the Gospel

00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.519
bringeth forth fruit.

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:57.799
We understand that Paul said this in Romans 1

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:59.519
in v. 16 that he's not ashamed

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:00.639
of the Gospel of Christ,

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:03.879
why? For it is the power of God unto salvation.

00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:05.879
And we find that we're to preach the Gospel

00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:06.959
to every creature,

00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:09.399
but we notice here in v. 6

00:24:09.399 --> 00:24:11.319
that the Bible says that the Gospel

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:17.479
brings forth fruit.

00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:18.799
The Gospel.

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:21.119
It brings fruit.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:23.159
See, the seed of the Gospel

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:25.519
needs to get out of the barn.

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:27.879
There's no point in keeping the seed of the Gospel

00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:28.999
in the barn. No.

00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:30.519
There's a lost and dying world

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.879
that needs the Gospel.

00:24:32.879 --> 00:24:36.519
And the Gospel brings fruit.

00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:38.679
It produces fruit.

00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:40.839
It is the power of God unto salvation.

00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:45.359
It is the means that God has determined

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:48.239
that we would preach the Gospel to every creature.

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:51.479
And he says that it doth,

00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:52.279
it says this,

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:53.959
"...and bringeth forth fruit

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:57.239
as it doth also in you."

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.839
So, understand with me

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:01.359
what Paul was saying to these believers in Colossae.

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:03.479
Understand with me personally

00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:06.159
if we were to understand that I've been saved,

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:07.119
you've been saved,

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:09.439
you've trusted Jesus as your personal Savior,

00:25:09.479 --> 00:25:10.999
and you can take the truth

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:12.439
of this passage of Scripture

00:25:12.439 --> 00:25:13.599
and apply it in your own heart

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:14.559
and your own life,

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:16.559
that I've received the Gospel.

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:18.479
I've believed Jesus Christ.

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:21.719
I've trusted Him as my personal Savior.

00:25:21.719 --> 00:25:22.959
I've been born again.

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:24.719
I can be referred to as a saint

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:25.919
because I am in Christ

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:28.079
and Christ dwells within me.

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:29.439
And we find here

00:25:29.439 --> 00:25:33.199
that it brought forth fruit in me.

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:35.719
And it gives me the confidence

00:25:35.719 --> 00:25:37.119
that it has the ability

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:40.479
to bring forth fruit in others.

00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:43.239
What did the Gospel do for you?

00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:44.799
Aren't you thankful that someone

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.039
didn't look at you and say,

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:50.799
yeah, I don't think the Gospel can work for them?

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.159
I think we'll go somewhere else.

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:56.079
They don't look like they're interested.

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.919
Oh, I'm thankful

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:00.799
for the power of the Gospel in my life.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.879
I'm thankful for the fruit

00:26:01.879 --> 00:26:04.279
that it's brought forth in my life.

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.759
But I'm encouraged as I read verse 6

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:07.839
as the Bible tells me,

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:09.599
listen, it doth also in you,

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:11.199
it brought forth fruit in me,

00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:12.799
but it's gone not only to me,

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.199
it's gone into all the world.

00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:15.599
And it bringeth forth fruit.

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:18.199
This morning, I hope that we'd be challenged

00:26:18.199 --> 00:26:19.959
by the thought of v. 6.

00:26:19.959 --> 00:26:21.639
Yes, as we are encouraged

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:24.039
by the way in which these believers

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:24.959
are described,

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:26.279
that we would be challenged

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:28.399
that the Gospel would go forward

00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:31.799
and that it would bring forth fruit.

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:33.159
You say people don't want to hear.

00:26:33.199 --> 00:26:34.039
Says who?

00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:38.239
Says who?

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:41.119
By the way, our job has never been

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:42.839
to make people hear.

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:44.879
Our job has been to give the Gospel.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.239
To just go forth

00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:49.359
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

00:26:50.439 --> 00:26:52.639
And we can have the faith

00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:53.839
and the confidence

00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:56.159
that it will bring forth fruit.

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:58.439
This is God's way.

00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:00.079
And shall I say this morning

00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:02.679
that God's way works.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:06.359
God's way needs not improvement.

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:08.839
God's way needs not to be updated.

00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:12.359
God's way just needs to be worked.

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:13.679
We just need to do it.

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:16.519
We just need to do what God said.

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:17.559
So often,

00:27:19.399 --> 00:27:22.599
we can sit around in these little group sessions

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:25.719
and have these conversations.

00:27:25.719 --> 00:27:27.399
Periodicals are written.

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:30.719
Seminars are held.

00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:33.799
How to church growth.

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:35.519
Reaching a community.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:37.479
We just need to do what God said

00:27:37.479 --> 00:27:39.119
and just preach the Gospel.

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:44.119
We notice not only how they are described,

00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:48.399
but I want you to notice their love displayed.

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:50.399
Notice their love displayed.

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:52.479
Go back with me to verse number four.

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:55.839
I want you to pick up on what Paul says

00:27:56.959 --> 00:27:59.519
that he heard from Epaphras

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:02.279
because it's obvious that he,

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:04.199
if you look in verse number eight,

00:28:04.199 --> 00:28:09.199
who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

00:28:09.999 --> 00:28:12.439
So Epaphras was the man that God would use,

00:28:12.439 --> 00:28:14.879
the servant of the Lord that God would use

00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:16.919
to be a faithful minister there in Colossae,

00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.119
but also to bring word to Paul

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:21.799
about this group of believers.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.679
And Paul says in verse number four,

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:27.319
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

00:28:27.319 --> 00:28:29.439
what a blessing to hear about their faith,

00:28:30.239 --> 00:28:31.079
their salvation.

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:32.799
But notice what else he heard.

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:37.799
And of the love which ye have to all the saints.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:44.199
We notice how these believers are described,

00:28:44.199 --> 00:28:48.039
but we also notice their love displayed.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:50.319
The love which ye have to all the saints.

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:52.039
Again, in verse number eight it says,

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.839
who also, speaking of Epaphras,

00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:58.839
declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:01.519
Hold your place here in the book of Colossians

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:02.839
and turn back to the book of John

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:05.399
in the 13th chapter, if you will.

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:07.079
And I know that it's a familiar verse

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.399
of passage of Scripture.

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.439
In fact, on Wednesday evening,

00:29:10.439 --> 00:29:12.879
as we dealt with John 14,

00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:14.319
this past Wednesday evening,

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:17.439
I made some reference to John 13.

00:29:17.439 --> 00:29:20.279
But I want you to notice what Jesus says.

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:22.119
Read the verses with me.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.679
In John 13, in verse number 33,

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:26.159
Jesus says this.

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.719
Let me back up to verse 31 and catch it in context.

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:29.559
The Bible says,

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:31.599
therefore, when He was gone out,

00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:35.839
Jesus said, now is the Son of Man glorified

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:39.239
and God is glorified in Him.

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:42.239
When it says there in verse number 31,

00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:44.999
He was, therefore, when He was gone out,

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:46.959
that's speaking of Judas Iscariot.

00:29:46.959 --> 00:29:49.079
Of course, if you look back

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.559
into the preceding text of Scripture,

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:53.999
you'll see how that He was the one

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:57.639
that would, of course, betray the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:57.639 --> 00:29:59.559
And it says in verse 32,

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:01.439
if God be glorified in Him.

00:30:01.439 --> 00:30:03.679
but God shall also glorify Him in Himself

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.599
and shall straightway glorify Him."

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:06.919
Verse 33,

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:09.079
"'Little children,

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:11.319
yet a little while I am with you.

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:12.339
Ye shall seek Me,

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:13.759
and as I said unto the Jews,

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:15.879
whither I go ye cannot come.

00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:19.359
So now I say to you,

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:22.999
a new commandment I give unto you,

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:26.719
that ye love one another,

00:30:26.719 --> 00:30:29.839
as I have loved you,

00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:34.079
that ye also love one another.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:40.999
By this shall all men know

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:45.839
that ye are My disciples,

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:50.839
if ye have love one to another.'"

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:54.679
Isn't that a powerful passage of Scripture?

00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:55.479
Jesus says,

00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:57.519
"'A new commandment I give unto you,

00:30:57.519 --> 00:31:00.439
this new commandment is that you love one another,

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:02.559
as I have loved you.'"

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.239
You think about the love of God.

00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:06.639
You think about the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:09.079
It says that He loved Him unto the end.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:11.039
He loves us with an unconditional love.

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:14.039
He loves us with a sacrificial love.

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:16.879
And here the Bible says that we're to love one another.

00:31:16.879 --> 00:31:18.519
And then Jesus says this,

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:21.479
"'By this shall all men know

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:26.879
that ye are My disciples.'"

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:30.319
Do all men know that we are the disciples of Christ

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:33.799
by observing how we love one another?

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:35.399
I mean, we look at the church in Corinth

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:37.279
and it's full of divisions

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:39.719
and all kinds of difficulties

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:41.039
that they're dealing with.

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:43.359
I mean, I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas,

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:44.399
I'm of Apollos,

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.599
and there's divisions and there's carnality.

00:31:46.599 --> 00:31:48.759
Surely the love of Christ

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:52.839
was not undisplayed by those believers in Corinth.

00:31:52.839 --> 00:31:56.559
But Jesus said that we're to love one another.

00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:58.599
He said this is the way in which men are going to know

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:04.279
that you're My disciples if you have love one to another.

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:05.439
The church in Thessalonica,

00:32:05.439 --> 00:32:09.239
turn to 1 Thessalonians 4 if you will.

00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:11.599
The church in Thessalonica

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:13.159
had been properly instructed

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:19.639
and they understood this truth of brotherly love.

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:22.399
Of loving one another

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:25.239
as Jesus commanded in John 13.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.479
Paul would write to this group of believers

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:33.999
in 1 Thessalonians 4 in particular.

00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:35.559
And I want you to notice with me

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:37.999
in v. 1 of 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:38.839
the Bible says,

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:41.799
"...furthermore then, we beseech you, brethren,

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:43.919
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:46.119
that as ye have received of us

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:50.199
how ye ought to walk and to please God,

00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:55.159
so ye would abound more and more."

00:32:55.159 --> 00:32:56.719
See, these believers in Thessalonica,

00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:58.999
they were being instructed.

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:00.559
And specifically,

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:02.799
they're being taught about brotherly love

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:03.759
in verses 9 and 10.

00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:05.999
If you skip over and look at those verses,

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:07.119
look at what the Bible says

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.439
as Paul is continuing to instruct these believers.

00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:12.279
He says, "...but as touching brotherly love,

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:14.759
you need not that I write unto you.

00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:16.679
For ye yourselves are taught of God

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:20.839
to love one another.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:26.039
And indeed, ye do it toward all the brethren

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:29.279
which are in all Macedonia."

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:31.439
Isn't that a great testimony?

00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:33.999
Paul says to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:35.639
he says, I want you to understand

00:33:35.639 --> 00:33:38.279
that we've taught you how you've received of us

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.399
how you ought to walk

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:40.679
and how you ought to please God.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:45.639
And it pleases God when we obey Him.

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:47.959
And as we look here in this subject

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:49.319
of brotherly love,

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:52.399
Paul says, I don't need to really write this unto you

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.359
because you know you're taught of God

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:55.279
to love one another,

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:59.359
and indeed, ye do it toward all the brethren

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.879
which are in all Macedonia.

00:34:00.879 --> 00:34:02.279
What a joy and what a blessing.

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:03.999
What a great testimony

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:05.759
this church in Thessalonica had

00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:07.279
with regard to brotherly love

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:10.919
and with loving one another.

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:12.959
But notice what he says.

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:14.079
But we beseech you,

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.159
the end of verse 10,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.799
but we beseech you, brethren,

00:34:17.799 --> 00:34:23.519
that ye increase more and more.

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:25.719
Don't get comfortable with where you are.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.399
Increase more and more.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.319
I mean, what a joy.

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:33.399
I often hear about folks

00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:35.679
that would say of our church,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.879
even though 2020 was a different kind of a year,

00:34:37.879 --> 00:34:40.279
we didn't have as much opportunity for fellowship

00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:41.359
and so on and so forth,

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:43.399
but I often hear over the years

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:44.839
of folks that would say

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:47.679
the genuine concern and love

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.319
that the believers,

00:34:49.319 --> 00:34:50.479
that the members of the church

00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:52.079
have one for another.

00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:52.999
Praise the Lord.

00:34:52.999 --> 00:34:56.039
That's how it's supposed to be.

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.399
Amen?

00:34:57.399 --> 00:34:59.719
We love one another.

00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:02.839
We love one another.

00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:05.719
In 1 Peter 4,

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:07.559
in verse 8,

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:08.679
Peter says this,

00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:09.799
and above all things,

00:35:09.799 --> 00:35:15.079
have fervent charity among yourselves.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:18.839
Have fervent charity among yourselves.

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:22.239
John would say in 1 John 4,

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:27.439
now understand that John was there

00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:30.319
in John 13 as we read that portion of Scripture

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:32.479
where Jesus gave that new commandment.

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:34.359
The Apostle John was there.

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:35.919
And now many years later,

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:37.599
God would use the Apostle John

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:42.359
to pen the book of 1 John.

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:45.879
And in 1 John 4 and verse 7,

00:35:45.879 --> 00:35:46.639
the Bible says,

00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:49.479
Beloved, let us love one another,

00:35:49.479 --> 00:35:51.639
for love is of God.

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:54.759
And everyone that loveth is born of God

00:35:54.759 --> 00:35:57.079
and knoweth God.

00:35:57.079 --> 00:35:58.799
Let us love one another.

00:35:58.799 --> 00:36:00.359
Let us love one another.

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:03.999
You see, as I go back to the book of Colossians,

00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:06.039
and I notice in these first few verses

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:07.879
of this book that we're going to study

00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:08.999
throughout this year,

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:10.759
and we'll get through all of it,

00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:13.079
and as we get through the book of Colossians

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:15.079
and we're introduced to these believers

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:16.439
in Colossae,

00:36:16.439 --> 00:36:18.999
when we have the privilege of understanding

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:20.679
what Paul heard of them,

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.839
how he received from Epaphras

00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:26.359
this word about these believers

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:28.599
over in this city of Colossae,

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:30.399
and he heard about their conversion.

00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:32.839
He heard about their position in Christ.

00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:34.639
He heard about the way in which

00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:36.479
the Gospel got to their city

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:41.239
and how there were many that trusted Christ.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:42.959
And they were there,

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:44.479
and we see how they're described,

00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:46.239
but we notice what is displayed,

00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:48.079
their love that is displayed.

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:48.839
He says,

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:52.639
And of the love which ye have

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:54.839
to all the saints.

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:55.639
To all the saints.

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:56.919
I think it's interesting that it says

00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:59.839
to all the saints.

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:00.839
Because it's not supposed to be like,

00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:01.479
well, I love them,

00:37:01.479 --> 00:37:02.839
but that one over there

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:04.399
is kind of difficult to deal with.

00:37:04.399 --> 00:37:05.599
They kind of rub me the wrong way.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:09.719
Our personalities kind of throw that out.

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:12.239
We're to have love one for another.

00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:13.479
By the way, we should be happy

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:16.399
that not everybody is exactly like we are.

00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:17.159
Amen?

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:18.919
Because if everybody is exactly like you were,

00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:21.039
if everyone is exactly like I was,

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:22.839
whoo, it'd be a rough place.

00:37:22.839 --> 00:37:25.039
Honestly.

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:28.639
Sometimes I annoy myself.

00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:30.279
And if everybody else was like me,

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:33.159
it'd be problematic.

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:36.119
God's made us all different.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:40.159
We're to love all the saints.

00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:44.999
The Bible says that Paul heard of their faith,

00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:46.719
but it also shows us of their love

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:48.479
that was displayed.

00:37:48.479 --> 00:37:50.599
And of the love which ye have

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:52.319
to all the saints.

00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:54.559
How are we doing?

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:56.639
How are we doing?

00:37:56.639 --> 00:38:00.319
I hope that we're following

00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:04.919
the instruction of Christ in John 13.

00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:09.119
I hope that when people would observe us,

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:11.439
they'd say, man, they love each other.

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:13.719
They love each other.

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:17.239
And it's genuine.

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.879
Notice with me,

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:22.359
not only how these folks in Colossae

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:23.279
are described,

00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:27.119
not only do we notice their love being displayed,

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.839
but I notice in these first few verses

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.079
of Colossians 1,

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:33.879
I notice that they had been discipled.

00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:36.759
They'd been discipled.

00:38:36.759 --> 00:38:39.199
Notice with me in verse 7,

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:41.599
two phrases in this particular verse of Scripture.

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:42.439
The Bible says,

00:38:42.439 --> 00:38:47.719
as ye also learned of Epaphras.

00:38:47.719 --> 00:38:52.479
Now, Paul calls him our dear fellow servant.

00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:54.719
You understand that Paul and Epaphras,

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:56.639
they have the opportunity.

00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:57.959
As you read the book of Philemon,

00:38:57.959 --> 00:39:00.679
you'll see some reference to Epaphras

00:39:00.679 --> 00:39:01.679
there in the book of Philemon.

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:03.679
We won't take time to turn there,

00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:05.799
but you see that Paul refers to Epaphras

00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:07.679
as our dear fellow servant.

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.199
But you notice that the Bible says,

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:11.879
as ye, speaking of the believers in Colossae,

00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:13.599
as ye also learned.

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:16.519
That's the key word I want you to focus upon that.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:19.119
They have learned of Epaphras.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:19.999
Notice what it says,

00:39:19.999 --> 00:39:26.279
who is for you a faithful minister of Christ.

00:39:26.279 --> 00:39:28.959
Now, someone that is a faithful minister,

00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:33.279
there's some criteria that would go along

00:39:33.279 --> 00:39:35.679
with that terminology.

00:39:35.679 --> 00:39:39.039
You understand that there's a reference

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:42.079
to a good minister, a faithful minister.

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.279
Listen, Paul was not just throwing out

00:39:44.279 --> 00:39:45.919
accolades to Epaphras.

00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:48.639
This is the Word of God.

00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:52.839
What made this man a faithful minister?

00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:54.399
What made him a good minister?

00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:56.399
Well, hold your place here in Colossians.

00:39:56.399 --> 00:39:58.039
Turn to the book of 1 Timothy, if you will.

00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:00.559
I'm glad that you asked the question this morning,

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:01.959
and you'd be interested.

00:40:01.959 --> 00:40:05.239
in knowing why is Epaphras,

00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:07.319
why is it that he's referred to

00:40:07.319 --> 00:40:10.439
as a faithful minister of Christ?

00:40:10.439 --> 00:40:15.879
Well, Paul says this in 1 Timothy 4.

00:40:15.879 --> 00:40:18.599
I won't take the time to read the first five verses,

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:20.499
but I would encourage you to read

00:40:20.499 --> 00:40:22.839
as the Bible gives us some interesting truth

00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:24.659
with regard to the description

00:40:24.659 --> 00:40:27.399
of the latter times

00:40:27.399 --> 00:40:29.059
in which we're living, no doubt.

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.939
But notice verse 6 of 1 Timothy 4.

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:34.479
If thou... who's he speaking to?

00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:35.719
He's speaking to Timothy.

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:38.659
That's who the book is written to.

00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:41.979
He says, if thou put the brethren

00:40:41.979 --> 00:40:45.399
in remembrance of these things,

00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:49.439
thou shalt be a good minister

00:40:49.439 --> 00:40:51.679
of Jesus Christ,

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.839
nourished up in the words of faith

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.339
and of good doctrine

00:40:55.339 --> 00:41:00.239
whereunto thou hast attained.

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:02.619
The Apostle Paul says, listen,

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:04.459
you need to do these things,

00:41:04.459 --> 00:41:06.419
and as you would do these things,

00:41:06.419 --> 00:41:09.219
and as you would put them,

00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:11.259
the people that you've been called to lead

00:41:11.259 --> 00:41:12.219
and minister to,

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:13.819
as you would put them in remembrance

00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:14.899
of these things,

00:41:14.899 --> 00:41:16.299
then you would be acknowledged

00:41:16.299 --> 00:41:21.119
as being a good minister of Jesus Christ.

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:23.179
We understand that Paul gives instruction.

00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:25.139
He does not use the specific terminology,

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:27.379
but in 2 Timothy 4,

00:41:27.379 --> 00:41:28.559
when he says to Timothy,

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:30.699
I charge thee therefore before God

00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:32.299
and the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:41:32.299 --> 00:41:34.419
who shall judge the quick and the dead

00:41:34.419 --> 00:41:36.299
at His appearing in His kingdom,

00:41:36.299 --> 00:41:37.539
preach the Word,

00:41:37.539 --> 00:41:39.099
be instant in season, out of season,

00:41:39.099 --> 00:41:41.259
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:42.979
in doctrine, for the time will come

00:41:42.979 --> 00:41:44.859
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:47.339
but after their own lusts shall they

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:48.819
heap to themselves teachers

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:50.319
having itching ears.

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:52.479
They shall turn away their ears from the truth

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:54.059
and shall be turned unto fables.

00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:56.539
But watch thou in all things,

00:41:56.539 --> 00:41:57.799
endure afflictions,

00:41:57.799 --> 00:41:59.799
do the work of an evangelist,

00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:04.259
make full proof of thy ministry.

00:42:04.259 --> 00:42:05.559
Paul says to Timothy,

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:06.859
you're going to be a good servant,

00:42:06.859 --> 00:42:09.019
a good minister, a faithful minister,

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:11.059
preach the Word.

00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:13.639
Peter says this to the individuals

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:16.959
that he's writing to in 1 Peter 5.

00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:18.599
We find that the focus

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:20.719
of this particular few verses

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:23.119
to look at what we're focusing on here

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:25.639
this morning in this passage of Scripture

00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:29.679
is that he's speaking to the ministers,

00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:33.099
to the pastors, to the leaders of the church.

00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:36.759
Notice with me in verse 1 of 1 Peter 5.

00:42:36.759 --> 00:42:39.939
The elders which are among you I exhort,

00:42:39.939 --> 00:42:41.139
who am also an elder

00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:43.139
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ

00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:44.759
and also a partaker of the glory

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:46.559
that shall be revealed.

00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:48.519
Notice what he tells these elders,

00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:51.399
these pastors, these leaders,

00:42:51.399 --> 00:42:53.659
these spiritual leaders.

00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:54.499
He says,

00:42:54.499 --> 00:42:59.379
feed the flock of God which is among you,

00:42:59.379 --> 00:43:01.099
taking the oversight thereof,

00:43:01.099 --> 00:43:03.239
not by constraint, but willingly,

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:05.679
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,

00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:07.559
neither as being lords over God's heritage,

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:10.159
but being in samples to the flock.

00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:10.919
Notice this,

00:43:10.919 --> 00:43:13.579
and when the chief shepherd shall appear,

00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:16.179
ye shall receive a crown of glory

00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:20.019
that fadeth not away.

00:43:20.019 --> 00:43:22.219
Now, verse 4 encourages me

00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:23.239
as a pastor,

00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:26.099
as one that would take this responsibility

00:43:26.099 --> 00:43:27.899
that has been placed upon me,

00:43:27.899 --> 00:43:29.499
being called into the ministry

00:43:29.499 --> 00:43:30.859
and God enabling me.

00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:33.459
The Bible says that when the chief shepherd shall appear,

00:43:33.459 --> 00:43:36.319
I'm thankful that the chief shepherd's coming back.

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:37.139
But the Bible says,

00:43:37.139 --> 00:43:38.539
ye shall receive a crown of glory

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:40.019
that fadeth not away.

00:43:40.019 --> 00:43:42.219
Can I say that everyone that calls themselves a pastor,

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.859
everyone that fills the office of elders,

00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:46.619
is not going to receive this reward?

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:49.519
Why? Because they're not feeding the flock of God.

00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:51.139
They're not being a faithful minister.

00:43:51.139 --> 00:43:54.139
They're not being a good minister.

00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:56.579
I long to please God.

00:43:56.579 --> 00:43:58.859
I long to be a faithful minister,

00:43:58.859 --> 00:43:59.859
a good minister,

00:43:59.859 --> 00:44:01.899
one who feeds the flock of God,

00:44:01.899 --> 00:44:03.459
that fulfills the responsibility,

00:44:03.459 --> 00:44:06.299
that would have the testimony of Epaphras

00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:09.179
here in Colossians 1 and verse 7.

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:13.099
A faithful minister of Christ.

00:44:13.099 --> 00:44:15.219
But we're noticing how they had been discipled.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.539
They had been discipled, no doubt, by Epaphras.

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:19.339
This faithful minister of Christ.

00:44:19.339 --> 00:44:24.899
We understand that the Great Commission is our mission.

00:44:24.899 --> 00:44:28.699
The Great Commission is our mission.

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:33.019
As a local New Testament church,

00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:36.579
we have our marching orders.

00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:38.979
We're not waiting for instruction from Heaven

00:44:38.979 --> 00:44:40.579
on what we're supposed to do.

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:42.459
He's already given us the instruction

00:44:42.459 --> 00:44:43.979
in the Word of God.

00:44:43.979 --> 00:44:46.819
The Great Commission is our mission.

00:44:46.859 --> 00:44:50.619
Oh, we need to have focus upon what our mission is.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:53.099
What happens with businesses,

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:55.219
with corporations over the years,

00:44:55.219 --> 00:44:57.699
you can see where they lose their focus

00:44:57.699 --> 00:45:00.299
of what their mission is.

00:45:00.299 --> 00:45:02.299
Most companies, most corporations,

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:06.819
entities, they have a mission statement.

00:45:06.819 --> 00:45:09.579
What's the purpose of their mission statement?

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:11.339
To communicate what their purpose is.

00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:15.059
To communicate what their mission is.

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:17.219
At times, if they're not careful,

00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:21.179
they can get distracted, detoured.

00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:25.699
They can lose focus of what their real mission is.

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:28.019
Can I tell you that the enemy wants to distract us

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:31.099
as the people of God from what our mission is?

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:34.579
He wants us to get caught up in all kinds of things.

00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:37.339
He wants us to get detoured and distracted

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:40.779
by all sorts of things that are going on in our world today.

00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:43.739
But we must refocus upon what our mission is.

00:45:43.739 --> 00:45:45.299
And the mission for the local church

00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:47.659
is the Great Commission.

00:45:47.659 --> 00:45:51.019
Notice that the Great Commission,

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:53.019
as we would speak about it,

00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:55.299
we would understand that discipleship

00:45:55.299 --> 00:45:59.259
is a vital part of this mission.

00:45:59.259 --> 00:46:01.659
I'd invite you to look over to Matthew 28

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:03.779
as we conclude this morning.

00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:08.179
We notice how these folks are described.

00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:10.139
We notice their love that's displayed,

00:46:10.219 --> 00:46:15.019
but we also take note that they had been discipled.

00:46:15.019 --> 00:46:16.579
The Great Commission is our mission,

00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:20.139
and discipleship is a vital part of that mission.

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:21.779
In Matthew 28 and verse 18,

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:23.739
Jesus came and spake unto them.

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.979
This is after His death, after His burial,

00:46:25.979 --> 00:46:27.459
after His resurrection,

00:46:27.459 --> 00:46:29.979
just prior to the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:46:29.979 --> 00:46:32.499
He's giving instruction to His people,

00:46:32.499 --> 00:46:34.259
His followers, and He says,

00:46:34.259 --> 00:46:36.579
all power is given unto Me

00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:38.859
in heaven and in earth.

00:46:38.899 --> 00:46:39.699
Notice this,

00:46:39.699 --> 00:46:46.379
Go ye therefore and teach all nations.

00:46:46.379 --> 00:46:47.339
What are we to teach them?

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:48.539
The Gospel.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:53.619
The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:46:53.619 --> 00:46:55.539
Baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:46:55.539 --> 00:46:57.739
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

00:46:57.739 --> 00:47:01.219
Baptism always follows salvation.

00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:04.459
We do not believe in infant baptism.

00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:08.019
We believe in believer's baptism by immersion.

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:11.299
After you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:47:11.299 --> 00:47:12.339
as your personal Savior,

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:15.779
that you follow Him in believer's baptism.

00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:17.659
It pictures the death, burial, and resurrection

00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:18.739
of Jesus Christ.

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.819
It shows that we're to be dead to the old self

00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:25.179
and rise to walk in newness of life.

00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:27.739
See, there is a proper mode of baptism,

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:30.499
but there's also a proper candidate for baptism.

00:47:30.499 --> 00:47:32.499
Remember the Ethiopian eunuch

00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:36.059
when he says there in Acts 8,

00:47:36.059 --> 00:47:39.779
here's water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?

00:47:39.779 --> 00:47:42.299
And I'm so thankful that Philip was able to say

00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:44.259
with great confidence that if you believe

00:47:44.259 --> 00:47:46.459
with all thine heart, thou mayest.

00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:47.739
He said, I believe!

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:49.099
And he said, stop the chariot,

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:52.139
let's get this guy baptized, amen?

00:47:52.139 --> 00:47:54.739
So the Great Commission teaching all nations,

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:56.419
giving the Gospel.

00:47:56.419 --> 00:47:57.939
Number two, baptizing.

00:47:57.939 --> 00:47:59.699
Number three, verse number 20,

00:47:59.699 --> 00:48:01.819
teaching them.

00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:02.459
Who's them?

00:48:02.459 --> 00:48:04.179
That's the converted people.

00:48:04.179 --> 00:48:05.779
The people that have been saved.

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:07.499
The people that have been baptized.

00:48:07.499 --> 00:48:10.739
Teaching them, notice what the Word of God says,

00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:14.899
to observe all things,

00:48:14.899 --> 00:48:18.179
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:48:18.179 --> 00:48:20.459
And lo, I am with you always,

00:48:20.459 --> 00:48:22.739
even unto the end of the world.

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:26.579
Amen.

00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:29.059
Far too often,

00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:34.099
the Great Commission stops at verse 19.

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:36.299
Discipleship ministry of a local church

00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:40.419
is imperative.

00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:43.219
It's key.

00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:45.339
That believers are discipled,

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.139
that they're taught to observe all things

00:48:48.139 --> 00:48:51.219
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:52.979
It's the responsibility of the leadership

00:48:52.979 --> 00:48:55.819
of the church to provide discipleship,

00:48:55.819 --> 00:48:57.659
that teaching.

00:48:57.659 --> 00:48:59.859
Oh, discipleship happens from the pulpit

00:48:59.859 --> 00:49:02.659
as the Word of God is taught and preached.

00:49:02.699 --> 00:49:04.659
Discipleship happens in classrooms.

00:49:04.659 --> 00:49:07.539
Discipleship happens having coffee.

00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:10.499
Discipleship can happen in a number of ways.

00:49:10.499 --> 00:49:13.339
As the Word of God is given and instructed,

00:49:13.339 --> 00:49:16.699
and a person, an individual that has been saved

00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:21.299
sits and hears and receives the instruction.

00:49:21.299 --> 00:49:23.139
And as they receive that instruction,

00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:24.779
they're to be doers of the Word,

00:49:24.779 --> 00:49:26.739
not hearers only.

00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:28.459
And we see how the Word of God

00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:29.579
would spread forth

00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:35.059
and how the cause of Christ would move forward.

00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:37.939
I'm so thankful that Jesus has promised

00:49:37.939 --> 00:49:39.659
to be with us as we go to fulfill

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:42.419
this Great Commission.

00:49:42.419 --> 00:49:46.419
But as I look at the church in Colossae,

00:49:46.419 --> 00:49:50.099
I notice that they had been discipled.

00:49:50.099 --> 00:49:51.539
They had been taught.

00:49:51.539 --> 00:49:53.699
As you also learned of Epaphras,

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:55.299
our dear fellow servant,

00:49:55.299 --> 00:50:00.299
who was for you a faithful minister of Christ.

00:50:00.299 --> 00:50:02.019
I'm thankful that Epaphras taught

00:50:02.019 --> 00:50:08.939
Word of God. But you know, these believers had to show up to receive the

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:15.099
instruction. Amen? He could have discipleship class. Hey, we're gonna have

00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:20.739
discipleship class on Tuesday night at whatever time. Who's gonna show up?

00:50:20.739 --> 00:50:30.539
There's a desire to learn, a desire to grow. I want to know the Lord Jesus

00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:37.979
Christ. I want to be discipled. I want to be instructed. This morning, as we're

00:50:37.979 --> 00:50:42.619
introduced to these believers in Colossae, we learn a little bit by way of

00:50:42.619 --> 00:50:45.779
introduction of where the city was and some of the things that were going on.

00:50:45.779 --> 00:50:53.299
But I want you to notice how they were described. Saints. Faithful brethren. I

00:50:53.299 --> 00:51:00.179
want you to notice their love that was displayed. How that they loved all the

00:51:00.179 --> 00:51:05.699
saints. And then I want you to notice that they were discipled. They were

00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:12.939
growing. They're being taught. Oh, that God would help us to be encouraged by

00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:17.459
reading about this church in Colossae. Oh, that God would help us to be challenged

00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:24.499
in our own walk with Christ. Have you been saved? Perhaps there's one that's

00:51:24.499 --> 00:51:27.899
tuned in this morning that's never trusted Christ as their Savior. You

00:51:27.899 --> 00:51:32.139
couldn't be referred to as a saint or a faithful brethren, but today is the day

00:51:32.139 --> 00:51:38.099
of salvation. The gospel brings forth fruit. Jesus died for you. He was buried

00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:40.859
in a borrowed tomb and he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave. And

00:51:40.859 --> 00:51:44.739
the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:51.339
Maybe today you need to be saved. This morning we're challenged by the love for

00:51:51.339 --> 00:51:55.659
the saints, the love for the brethren. Maybe this morning we're challenged by

00:51:55.659 --> 00:52:02.059
our discipleship. How are we growing? Are we involved in discipleship? Are we

00:52:02.059 --> 00:52:09.859
eager to learn, to be discipled, to be taught the Word of God? The saints at

00:52:09.859 --> 00:52:14.939
Colossae, let us pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you

00:52:14.939 --> 00:52:20.619
for the book of Colossians. Thank you for this group of believers in Colossae where

00:52:20.619 --> 00:52:26.779
the gospel reached and souls were saved. It brings forth fruit. The gospel does.

00:52:26.779 --> 00:52:34.939
We're challenged by that truth. We're challenged to give the gospel, to preach

00:52:34.939 --> 00:52:39.579
the gospel. I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can over

00:52:39.579 --> 00:52:44.019
the next few moments of invitation. God, help us to be doers of the Word and not

00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:47.859
hearers only. If there's one that needs to be saved, I pray that today would be

00:52:47.939 --> 00:52:50.859
the day of their salvation. The Holy Spirit of God would convict them of

00:52:50.859 --> 00:52:56.339
their sin, of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. God, I pray that

00:52:56.339 --> 00:53:06.419
you'd help us to long to be like thee, to know thee, to grow in our walk with thee.

00:53:06.419 --> 00:53:09.779
Have your will and way in these few moments, for it's in Christ's name we

00:53:09.779 --> 00:53:13.179
pray. Amen.
