00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.159
Matthew chapter number 16 this evening, Matthew chapter number 16, and as you know, this is

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:11.880
part of our study through the book of Titus, and you say we haven't been in Titus in a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.880
long time.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.719
I understand, but let me remind you of what Paul says to Titus in Titus chapter number

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.280
2 and verse number 1.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.959
He says, but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:30.360
And so we, from that passage of scripture, of course, we made references, we studied

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.860
through Titus chapter number 1, the references that are given to us there with regard to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.000
doctrine and sound doctrine and the importance of sound doctrine.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.659
And so as we entered into the second chapter of the book of Titus, we kind of took this

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.000
path of dealing with doctrinal issues.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Doctrine is important, and we've laid the foundation, we dealt with bibliology, we then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.959
dealt with theology, and this evening we'll deal with Christology, and we'll begin studying

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.319
the doctrine of Christ, and we'll begin this evening with this passage of scripture in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.919
Matthew chapter number 16.

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:11.040
And so we'll be transitioning from the doctrine of God to the doctrine of Christ, and it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.959
important as we look at this passage of scripture, we'll focus upon the significance of this

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.279
question that Jesus asked to his disciples.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:26.160
We'll find this evening that the record that we'll look at is recorded here in Matthew,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.000
Mark, and also in the book of Luke, and so we'll reference each of those books this evening,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.559
and it's such an important question that is asked in verse number 13 of Matthew 16.

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:45.000
The Bible says this, when Jesus came into the coast of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.559
disciples saying, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:59.839
And as we think about this question that is at the end of verse number 13 here in Matthew's

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:06.199
Gospel in the 16th chapter, I would say this tonight, that this question is as important

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:11.839
today as it was on the first day that Jesus asked this question.

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.440
And why is it that we'd say that?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.639
He's speaking to the disciples, of course, and he's asking them, whom do men say that

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.119
I, the Son of Man, am?

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.320
And of course, he will say, as we'll study through the passage this evening in verse

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.580
number 15, but whom say ye that I am?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.320
And we find the significance of this question is this, if you get it wrong about Jesus and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.240
who he is, you're in grave danger.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.039
And we'll find this evening that just as we look at the passage of scripture that is recorded

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:50.160
for us, we will find that there still exists a great amount of confusion today about who

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.059
is Jesus.

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.360
Who is he?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.899
And we, of course, as followers of Jesus Christ, we need to know ourselves who he is, but it's

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:06.919
also imperative that we are able to communicate with those that we come into contact with

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.679
who he is.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.800
We preach Christ.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.559
That's what Paul says, he's writing to the believers in Corinth, and of course, we understand

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:18.139
as we read throughout the scriptures that we've been given the great commission that

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.600
we're to go and preach the gospel to every creature, and you understand today that there

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.479
is a great percentage of our population that do not know the Jesus of the Bible.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.399
They may know some things about Jesus, they may have been told some things about who Jesus

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:42.520
is, some, I believe this evening with all of my heart, that some in our community, in

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.479
our world, they know Jesus as nothing more than a swear word.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.619
They don't know who he is.

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:55.919
And as his people, as his followers, it's imperative that we know who he is, but that

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.240
we are adequately equipped to be able to share that truth with those that we come in contact

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240
with.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.679
And so, over the next several weeks, as we study the doctrine of Christ and we look at

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:10.199
the truth of God's word with regard to who Christ is, what are we doing?

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.520
We're trying to build up our faith, we're trying to get us to a place where we are sound

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.320
in doctrine, so that when we come in contact with those in our world that do not know Jesus,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.000
that we are equipped to be able to preach Christ.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.559
It's interesting, today, I had a dental appointment this morning, and as I was there at the dentist,

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:36.679
and I had never actually had this dentist do any work on me before, my dentist was tied

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:39.880
up and his partner was able to see me this morning.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.880
In any case, I told him that I was a pastor, we were just kind of chit-chatting in the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.720
beginning and what have you, and after they kind of gave me the shots and let the numbness

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.239
kind of set in, he said, so give me a preview of your message this evening.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:56.239
What a great opportunity.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:01.920
And I said, here's the message I'll be preaching tonight, whom do men say that I am?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.920
And I said, Jesus was speaking to his disciples, and he asked them that question, and they

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920
responded.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.200
The disciples say, well, some say this, some say that, and I began to share with him the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.880
truth of who Jesus is, a unique opportunity.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.399
And I was thankful for the divine appointment that God had given me that this evening the

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.760
subject matter of our message was whom do men say that I am?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.279
And he says, give me a preview of the message, what a great opportunity.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:37.200
And this evening, we'll find that as we look at this passage and look at the sister passages

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.799
of Mark and Luke, we'll find the significance of this truth.

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:47.040
So the title, if you're taking notes, whom do men say that I am?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.799
Whom do men say that I am?

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:54.079
Notice with me, if you're taking notes, number one, the confusion of the people.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.839
The confusion of the people.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.640
We find that Jesus is speaking to his disciples directly in verse number 13.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.920
And he says to them, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.600
And they said, the disciples provide an answer to the Lord Jesus Christ in verse number 14.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.760
And notice, there are really four different aspects that are given here.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.079
It says this, some say that thou art John the Baptist.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:23.839
So there was a group of people, there was a contingency of those that they had come

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:30.799
in contact with that the disciples were aware of what their understanding of who Jesus was.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:32.760
Because listen, Jesus was well known.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760
There were many people.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.399
You find that as you study through the scriptures, as Jesus would enter into a community, as

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.839
he would go and he'd teach, there were throngs of people.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.519
They were aware of Jesus, but the question is, who is he?

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:49.000
Who is this Jesus?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.380
Who is this one?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.440
And we find that Jesus says, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.760
And they said, well, there's some that say you're John the Baptist.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.440
There's another group, notice in verse number 14, some, Elias or Elijah.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.320
We find that it says, and others, Jeremias or Jeremiah.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.679
And then there's this last statement, or one of the prophets.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:20.640
And so there are people that have come to this conclusion of who Jesus is.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.679
And there's confusion.

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:24.359
We see the confusion of the people.

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:25.679
Is Jesus John the Baptist?

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:26.920
No, he's not.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920
Is Jesus Elijah?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920
No.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920
Is he Jeremiah?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920
No.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920
Is he one of the prophets?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920
No.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920
He is God in flesh.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.200
But there were some people that had, it wasn't like, well, they don't know who you are.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200
They don't know.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
They concluded wrong.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.279
They were confused as to who Jesus was.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:47.959
And they said, John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, one of the prophets.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:53.040
And it's interesting, for as we look at this passage of Scripture and see the way in which

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.200
the disciples answered Jesus, I want you to keep this in mind and turn to Mark chapter

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.260
number six, if you will.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.799
And this is not the sister passage that deals with the same context of what we're dealing

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:06.799
with with this question.

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:08.239
We'll look at that in just a moment.

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:14.399
But in Mark chapter number six, I want you to see this reference with regard to Herod.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:21.119
In Mark six and verse number 14, the Bible says this, and King Herod heard of him.

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:23.880
The him is Jesus.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.480
It says, for his name was spread abroad.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.619
I just told you that we understand.

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:33.659
You study through the Gospels and you'll see that there were many that knew about Jesus.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:41.900
And he said, Herod said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.179
And therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.

00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:53.659
Others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:58.780
But when Herod heard thereof, he said, it is John whom I beheaded.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.140
He is risen from the dead.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.140
Herod was wrong.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.460
He was wrong about who Jesus was.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.940
Jesus wasn't John the Baptist resurrected.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.820
And he is, Jesus is God in flesh.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.840
But we find that as the disciples would give the answer that we are reading in Matthew

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:21.380
chapter number 16, that there's record of Herod having this idea that Jesus is John

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.900
the Baptist, that there were others that said, no, we hear what you're saying, but we don't

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.200
think he's John the Baptist.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.580
We think he's Elijah or he's one of the prophets or he's like a prophet.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.460
Notice a few passages over in Mark chapter number nine, excuse me, Mark chapter number

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:43.020
eight, the sister passage for what we're studying there in Matthew's gospel, Jesus is speaking

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.940
in verse number 27, it says this, and Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940
of Caesarea Philippi.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.500
And by the way, he asked his disciples saying unto them, whom do men say that I am?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500
And we see the same discussion that takes place.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.299
He'll then ask them in verse number 29.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:04.839
but whom say ye that I am?" And as we look here, it's interesting, for the Bible

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:08.859
says that as they were going, listen, they were... Jesus went out, his disciples

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:14.419
into the towns of Caesarea Philippi, and by the way, he asked his disciples, saying

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:18.419
unto them, whom do men say that I am? Notice over in the book of Luke, in Luke

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:25.139
chapter 9, and I want you to notice here the passage and the

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:31.099
insight that we're given with regard to this again, what's taking place. It says

00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:35.179
in verse number 18 of Luke chapter number 9, and it came to pass as he was

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.959
alone praying, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, saying, whom say

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:43.979
the people that I am? They answering said, John the Baptist, but some say Elias, and

00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:47.739
others say that one of the old prophets is risen again, and then of course he

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:52.499
says, but whom say ye that I am? And so Matthew, Mark, and Luke are all recording

00:10:52.499 --> 00:10:59.499
this absolute significant question. We're dealing with, as we begin studying

00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:02.979
and looking at this question that is asked, we're dealing with the confusion of the

00:11:02.979 --> 00:11:07.979
people, and I would ask this, why? Why is there confusion about who Jesus is? I

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:13.199
believe there's a very simple answer as to the source of the confusion, and it's

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:17.019
found in the truth that Paul would give to us in 2nd Corinthians chapter

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:21.139
number 4. Hold your place there in Matthew chapter 16, and turn to the book

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:26.099
of 2nd Corinthians, if you will, in chapter number 4, and as we look at this

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:30.819
passage and look at this truth that Paul is sharing with the church in Corinth

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:35.139
and with these believers, remember they've already been instructed with

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:39.179
regard to a number of things, and about the importance, the significance of

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:45.139
preaching the gospel in the first letter that's titled 1st Corinthians, but we

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:48.979
notice here in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4 in verse number 3, it says, but

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:54.739
if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. Now notice what the Bible

00:11:54.739 --> 00:12:01.699
says in verse number 4, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:06.859
them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:12.099
the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:17.459
Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus's sake. You notice in

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:22.059
verse number 4, the Bible speaks about the God of this world, that's Satan, and

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:27.179
the work that he's done to blind the minds of them which believe not. You

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:33.819
understand this evening that Satan does not want people to know who Jesus is. He

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:38.719
doesn't want people to know that Jesus is God, that he is the Messiah, that he is

00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:42.419
the only way to heaven. He doesn't want people to know that, and so

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:46.579
we find that there's this confusion. Listen, Satan is perfectly fine with

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:51.739
somebody believing in a historical Jesus as being a prophet, or being John

00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:56.819
the Baptist, risen again, or being you name it. Satan's perfectly fine with that,

00:12:56.819 --> 00:13:02.299
because if you get it wrong on Jesus, you're in grave danger, and we find that

00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:07.419
the God of this world, Satan himself, has blinded the minds of them which

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:11.659
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the

00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:17.139
image of God, should shine unto them. And so we understand this evening the source

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:23.379
of this confusion, why it was that these people were confused. Of course, Satan is

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:28.579
working. Remember, there's this spiritual battle that is constantly raging, and

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:35.699
Satan does not desire for anyone to know who Jesus really is. We find that the

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:40.739
confusion that is evidenced here in Matthew chapter number 16 in each of the

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:46.739
Gospels that record this discussion in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the confusion

00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:50.339
that is obvious, that is evidenced through the answer that the disciples

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:54.899
give—well, some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, some Jeremiah, some say one of

00:13:54.899 --> 00:14:01.139
the prophets—in that obvious confusion, the reality is that that confusion still

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:08.499
exists today. It continues to exist today. You can talk to various people that you

00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:13.459
come into contact with, and you can ask them who Jesus is. Whom do men say that I

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:17.859
am? Jesus asks his disciples that, but you just go ahead and start asking some

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:23.500
people, who is Jesus? Who is he? You know, there are some cults that teach some

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.979
really blasphemous things with regard to who Jesus Christ is. There are some world

00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:34.979
religions that teach some blasphemous things with regard to who Jesus Christ

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:39.899
is. They're perfectly fine with saying that he existed as a man, that he was a

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:43.940
prophet, he was a good man, he did some good things. They're okay with that. Why?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:49.099
Because he's not the Savior of the world. Because he's not God in flesh. And we

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:54.059
find that the battle that was raging during the life and ministry of the Lord

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:59.739
Jesus Christ with regard to his person and who he is continues to exist today.

00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:04.859
There's great confusion. It was interesting as I was speaking with the

00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:08.419
dentist this morning, and I was sharing things with him, he began to share with

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:12.579
me where he was from and some things that he experienced as a young person, so

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:18.539
on and so forth, and he identified with a certain denomination. And so he had some

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:23.459
knowledge of some of the scriptural things. And as we were speaking, he

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:27.659
shared with me how that in his country where he was from, and he grew up there

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:31.659
and he was there until he was 18, that it was very common to be able to talk openly

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:37.179
about your beliefs and about your religion, quote-unquote, even amongst those

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:41.579
that differed in their philosophies, their ideologies, it was a very common

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:46.459
thing. And he said, I noticed when I came to America that increasingly over the

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:49.259
years that I've been here, and he's been here for longer than he was in his home

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:55.500
country, that it's not commonly accepted to be able to just talk freely about

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.339
Jesus. It was very insightful to hear him say that because the reality is that

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:04.779
there are some people—I remember hearing when I was a child that there

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:09.500
were two things that you didn't talk about amongst family, religion and

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.319
politics. I heard that various times as I was growing up. You would come into the

00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:19.459
group of a family reunion, if you will, and there were two subject matters in

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:24.979
which they often said those were off-limits. Well, one of the grave

00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:29.579
results of those topics not being discussed is that there's a lack of

00:16:29.819 --> 00:16:34.220
knowledge about the truth of who Jesus is. Why? Because there were some people

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.500
that knew who he is, they know who he is, but they don't talk about it because

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.139
they don't feel like it's commonly accepted, socially acceptable to talk

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:47.859
about who Jesus is. But you understand that as God's people, we've been given a

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:55.259
command. We've been instructed to be his representatives, to be his ambassadors, to

00:16:55.259 --> 00:17:01.459
go forth and to speak his word with boldness, and that's our responsibility.

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:06.299
And so we find that the confusion that existed during the life and ministry of

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:12.419
the Lord Jesus Christ nearly 2,000 years ago continues to exist to this very day.

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:18.259
Now, honestly, I've not met anyone that said that he's John the Baptist. The

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:23.500
confusion is different as to who Jesus is, but I would submit to you that

00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:29.019
there's still confusion, a great amount of confusion. And we understand that

00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:33.699
they're confused because Satan has blinded their minds, and Satan is

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:40.859
perfectly fine with groups of people, world religions, cults, others, just

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:49.259
believing something short of who Jesus really is. We find not only the confusion

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:53.299
of the people, but I want you to notice with me as we go back to Matthew 16, the

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:58.859
confidence of Peter, the confidence of Peter. It's interesting in verse number

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:05.139
15 that Jesus, after he receives the answer that is provided from these

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:12.500
disciples, and it is interesting to me that the record that is given to us in

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:18.259
verse number 14, and they said, that's plural, correct? And Jesus is speaking to

00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:22.979
his disciples in verse number 13. He asked his disciples, again plural, whom

00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:27.899
do men say that I, the Son of Man, am? And they said, so there was more than one

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:33.739
disciple that responded, that answered Jesus. I almost, in my mind's eye, imagine

00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:39.059
it as they're there together, that one of the disciples, Andrew, James, John,

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:43.019
Peter, whomever, says, hey, some say that you're John the Baptist, and then one

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:49.919
pipes up and says, Jeremiah, and one says, right? Because they responded. But Jesus

00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:56.440
then says unto them, is them singular or plural? It's plural. He says to them, to

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.880
the disciples, the same group of people that he's speaking to in verse 13, but

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:11.200
whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered. Simon Peter answered. He is the

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.959
one, singular, the individual that provides an answer. I see the confidence

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:21.519
of Peter as I look at the passage of Scripture. In my mind's eye, again, as I

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:25.760
would imagine them walking and ministering and Jesus asking the

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.839
disciples and how they responded. And then, as he said, but whom do ye say that I am?

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:38.200
And I can, in my mind's eye, I can see Peter and I can hear Peter with

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:45.239
boldness and with confidence. I don't see it as being a timid response. Have you ever

00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:49.320
asked somebody a question and in their response you understand that they're not

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.080
really sure that that answer was correct? You've ever had that situation? You ask

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.919
somebody and they kind of, you know, and you can just kind of tell they just

00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:01.279
aren't real sure what they're talking about.

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:06.599
But when you ask somebody a question and they are confident in their response, they're a

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:13.719
matter of fact, you gain from their response, you gain a level of confidence as well.

00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:17.959
And we find that Peter answered, again, I believe with confidence and boldness, and

00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:25.739
he says, "'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'"

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:28.359
What a great declaration.

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:34.479
We find that the name, of course, Jesus, in verse number 13, when Jesus came into the

00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:38.679
coast of Caesarea Philippi, we had studied about the names of God in the Old Testament.

00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:42.559
We will also, as we study the doctrine of Christ, we'll review several of the names

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:45.479
that are mentioned of Jesus here in the New Testament.

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:50.879
But it is interesting that Jesus, the name that is mentioned in verse number 13, and

00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:55.359
then in verse number 16, that he, Peter, says, "'Thou art the Christ.'"

00:20:55.359 --> 00:21:02.239
Now, as we understand the name Jesus, it means Jehovah is salvation, God incarnate.

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:07.519
Remember, when the angel appeared to Mary with regard to the announcement of the birth

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:13.539
of Jesus, she was instructed that his name shall be called Jesus.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:16.959
Remember in verse 21 of Matthew 1, you don't need to turn there, I'll read it, "'And she

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:20.519
shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.'"

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:21.519
Why?

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:24.799
"'For he shall save his people from their sins.'"

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:28.199
And so Jehovah is salvation, God incarnate.

00:21:28.199 --> 00:21:33.479
The name Christ, when Peter stands up and says, "'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:41.159
living God,' the name Christ means the anointed, the Messiah, the Son of God, the promised

00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:47.759
one, the one that all of those messianic prophecies that you study and you read about in the Old

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:51.919
Testament and how that they are properly fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:57.679
Peter stands with this boldness and this confidence and he says, "'Thou art the Christ, the Son

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.879
of the living God.'"

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:06.799
It's interesting what is said in Jesus' response to Peter in verse number 17, "'And Jesus answered

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:12.879
and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed

00:22:12.879 --> 00:22:16.439
it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.'"

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:19.799
You understand that God wants us to know who Jesus is.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:23.319
When I say it that way, we understand that Jesus is God.

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:27.639
But what I'm saying is that we understand that Jesus is revealing himself.

00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:33.959
We understand that he manifested himself as we study the gospels and we look at all that's

00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:39.039
taking place in the incarnation and the deity of Christ and we study through the doctrine

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:47.599
of Christ how encouraged we will be as we understand the significance of who Jesus is.

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:52.639
And we understand, listen, you're not going to get this from some place, some school somewhere,

00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:53.639
some…

00:22:53.639 --> 00:23:02.359
No, God is revealing to Peter here, he's referred to as Simon Bar-Jonah in verse 17, God has

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:08.319
revealed this truth to him as to who Jesus is.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:13.079
The question that I have this evening for myself and for each of us that are here is

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:14.619
this.

00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:19.939
We understand that there is confusion amongst the people, we understand that, but which

00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:26.979
one amongst us will have the confidence that Peter had to stand up and declare who Jesus

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:27.979
is?

00:23:27.979 --> 00:23:33.659
See, it's important, as I said by way of introduction, it's important for us as the followers of

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:42.739
Christ to know who he is, that he is God, that he is the only Messiah.

00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:48.579
It's important for us to understand who Jesus is for ourselves, but also so that we could

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:51.819
share that message with those that we come into contact with.

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:52.819
Why?

00:23:52.819 --> 00:23:55.859
Because the only hope for anyone is Jesus.

00:23:55.859 --> 00:24:02.779
Jesus is the hope for lost sinners, Jesus is the hope for our nation, and the true Jesus

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:04.779
of the Bible.

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:10.059
Not some, well, he's a prophet, or he's a created angel, or he's a created being, he's

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:12.979
a, no, those are not true.

00:24:12.979 --> 00:24:13.979
He's God.

00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:20.819
And this evening, as we look at this passage of Scripture and begin our study of the doctrine

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:26.979
of Christ, we are mindful of the fact that even as Jesus asked this question nearly 2,000

00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:33.459
years ago, the question begs to be asked again this evening amongst those that we come into

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:35.019
contact with.

00:24:35.739 --> 00:24:41.139
We tonight, if we were to sit down and give an answer, even as the disciples did, whom

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:43.659
do men say that I am?

00:24:43.659 --> 00:24:45.339
You've come in contact with people.

00:24:45.339 --> 00:24:51.939
Who is it that those that you've spoken to, who is it that they say Jesus is?

00:24:51.939 --> 00:24:54.779
Have you heard some say that he's a teacher?

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:56.459
He's a prophet?

00:24:56.459 --> 00:24:57.459
He's a good man?

00:24:57.459 --> 00:25:03.179
I mean, some try to deny the very existence of Jesus, but you find that it's very hard

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:10.139
to deny his existence, so what the enemy has sought to do is not deny the existence,

00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:13.059
but change who he is.

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:17.899
It's very difficult to say that Jesus didn't exist.

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:24.299
There's record, abundance of record, that he existed.

00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:30.699
But what the enemy has done is not to deny his existence, but to alter who he is, to

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:34.739
cause confusion amongst the people of who he is.

00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:42.139
Because if man does not know who Jesus is, there's grave consequences.

00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:43.539
It's a grave danger.

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:44.539
Why?

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:49.899
For there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:25:49.899 --> 00:25:57.899
Listen, Jesus is not a way to heaven, he is the way to heaven.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:02.259
And we need to understand this evening that we're living in the midst of a people that

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:05.459
are confused about who Jesus is.

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:10.739
And we've been given a unique opportunity to be his representatives, his ambassadors,

00:26:10.739 --> 00:26:14.179
and we need to have the kind of confidence that Peter had.

00:26:14.179 --> 00:26:17.699
I understand he's answering Jesus, but I'm saying that we need to be able to have that

00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:22.259
kind of boldness and confidence as we come into contact with people.

00:26:22.259 --> 00:26:26.379
You hear people talking about Jesus and they're talking about him in a wrong way, that we'd

00:26:26.379 --> 00:26:31.259
have the opportunity to be able to stand up and say, hey, that's my Savior.

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:34.299
He died for me and he died for you.

00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:37.939
Begin to share the truth of who Jesus really is.

00:26:37.939 --> 00:26:40.379
He's not a swear word.

00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:44.619
He's God and he's the Savior of the world.

00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:52.299
And this evening, I hope that as we, tonight, have this introductory thought into the next

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:56.739
several lessons of the doctrine of Christ, that we would be mindful of the confusion

00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:01.299
that exists around us, that we would understand why that confusion exists, and that we would

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:06.979
be properly, adequately equipped so that we could give an answer, so that we not only

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:12.099
know ourselves who he is, but so that we could go and share that truth with those that we

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:13.699
come into contact with.

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:20.859
You know, there are people that have been, I mean, they have made it their life mission

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:28.899
to go through and try to attack every reference of Jesus being God, because we understand

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:32.219
the work of Satan behind the whole thing.

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:36.739
And so when we get to a position and we begin to interact with people and speak to them

00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:40.459
about Jesus, and they have these ideas of who Jesus is, and I could share some with

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:45.139
you privately of some things that I've heard over the years, how do we respond to it?

00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:51.779
Are we equipped to be able to answer the questions, to be able to preach Christ and

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:53.259
Christ alone?

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:55.779
This evening, whom do men say that I am?

00:27:55.779 --> 00:28:02.099
Of course, Peter stood up with great boldness and confidence, thou art the Christ, the Son

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:03.099
of the living God.

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:05.739
That's when Jesus said, whom do ye say that I am?

00:28:05.739 --> 00:28:10.179
Because there was confusion, but Peter had confidence, and we need to have that same

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:11.179
confidence.

00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:12.179
Let's pray.

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:13.179
Father, we love you.

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:14.179
We thank you for loving us.

00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:19.579
We thank you for your Word, for how you have revealed yourself to us through your Word.

00:28:19.579 --> 00:28:23.779
We thank you this evening for the opportunity to be your representatives.

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:29.819
And God, we are mindful, keenly aware of the fact that we live in the midst of a people

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:33.859
that are greatly confused about who you are.

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:45.459
The enemy has worked through cults and false teachers, world religions, to give a false

00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:49.499
teaching of the person of Jesus Christ.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:56.179
And God, I pray this evening that we as your followers would be properly, adequately equipped

00:28:56.179 --> 00:29:03.739
to be able to give an answer, to stand up with confidence and to proclaim who you are.

00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:06.859
We know the significance of this question.

00:29:06.859 --> 00:29:11.579
We know the cause of the confusion, and I pray that we would dig into your Word so that

00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:13.859
we could be equipped to answer.

00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:15.339
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:16.619
We thank you again for the privilege.

00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:20.499
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified through all that's said and done for the remainder

00:29:20.499 --> 00:29:21.499
of our service.

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:23.419
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:29:23.419 --> 00:29:24.419
Amen.

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:26.779
All right, if you have your prayer bullets in this evening.
