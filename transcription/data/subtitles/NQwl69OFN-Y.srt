1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
chapter number two this morning,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,519
2 Timothy chapter number two,

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:05,400
and I'm thankful for the opportunity

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,439
that we have to gather to study the precious word of God

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,319
and how blessed we are to have Bibles

6
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:16,299
that we can read and study and share the truth

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,239
of God's word with those that we come in contact with.

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,219
And for the last several weeks now,

9
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,239
we've had the opportunity to be studying here

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,559
through 2 Timothy chapter number two.

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,000
Of course, our theme for this year is continue.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,659
We're nearing the end of the year.

13
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,860
We've studied through 1 Timothy

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,860
and now making our way through 2 Timothy

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,580
as we see a recurring thought or theme

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,659
in these two letters that the apostle Paul

17
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,740
sent to Timothy, his own son in the faith.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,619
And really that theme is as we've had

19
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,740
for our calendar year, continue.

20
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,220
Though the difficulties are there,

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,740
though the opposition is there,

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,819
though the heartaches are there,

23
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,919
continue, continue to serve the Lord,

24
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,240
continue to live for Him.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,060
And I find that as we have been studying now,

26
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,900
this is our fifth lesson from 2 Timothy chapter two,

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,700
the fifth message from this passage of scripture,

28
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,139
as we have dealt with the subject of a good soldier.

29
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,699
I hope as we've mentioned many times now

30
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,019
that both you and I have that desire

31
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,139
that we would be a good soldier,

32
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,019
not simply being content with the reality

33
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,220
that we are soldiers.

34
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,199
If you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

35
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,739
as your personal savior,

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,620
you were enlisted into the army of God

37
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,819
and you are a soldier of God.

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,779
But we've had the opportunity as we've studied

39
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,139
through this portion of scripture

40
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:33,139
to understand that the Lord tells us

41
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:37,260
that there's this phrase of being a good soldier,

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,699
not just being a soldier, but being a good soldier.

43
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,139
And we've noted four characteristics

44
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,180
over the past four messages.

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,019
And we said this from verse number three,

46
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,459
that a good soldier endures hardness.

47
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,400
There'll be opposition, there'll be difficulty.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,059
I said this, that a soldier is a soldier

49
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,779
and some people have had the idea

50
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,339
that they wanna be a soldier, but they don't want conflict.

51
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,099
But the reality is that the soldier,

52
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:03,980
they don't want battle,

53
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,339
but the soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ,

54
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,580
we understand that we are engaged in spiritual battle,

55
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,880
spiritual warfare, and we need to endure hardness.

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,460
We said this, that a good soldier,

57
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,899
according to verse number four,

58
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:19,979
he avoids distractions.

59
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,759
And oh, is it not true that the distractions abound?

60
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,300
The enemy wants us to be distracted

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,020
from doing what God has commanded us to do.

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,679
We find that even in battle,

63
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:33,339
that the enemy sometimes will try to distract

64
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:35,940
through some type of decoy and what have you

65
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,660
in order to get the attention of the opposing army

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,080
to be distracted while something's taking place over here.

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,759
And we see even in the spiritual realm

68
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,919
that there are many distractions.

69
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,360
And a good soldier, he avoids distraction.

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,639
We said a good soldier from verse number four,

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,339
that he seeks to please his master.

72
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,520
Oh, I hope that your goal and your desire,

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,080
we think about the Christian life

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,279
and understanding that if you're saved this morning,

75
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,600
that you'll stand before the Lord Jesus Christ

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
at the judgment seat of Christ, the bema.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,520
And I hope as we see often in the New Testament

78
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,240
and the gospel accounts that we'll hear,

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,240
well done, thou good and faithful servant,

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,919
that we live our lives in such a way

81
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,080
that we desire to please the Lord.

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,679
You know, some people live trying to please others.

83
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,559
Some people try to please whoever it might be,

84
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:26,479
try to please the masses, the crowds, whatever it might be.

85
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,279
I have learned in life, you can't please everyone, amen.

86
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,839
You can't please everyone.

87
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:36,619
But I found that instead of trying to please people,

88
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,199
to please the crowds, the masses,

89
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,759
that if we can just live our lives to please the Lord,

90
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,320
because the reality is that it's so much more important

91
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,839
that God is pleased with us

92
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,240
than that the people are pleased with us.

93
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,839
And we must live with that understanding.

94
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,039
Last week, we dealt with the subject in verse number five,

95
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,800
and we said that a good soldier is disciplined,

96
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,320
and that discipline in the life of a good soldier

97
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,240
and how the good soldier, the disciplined soldier,

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,160
there's some things that he flees,

99
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,600
there's some things that he follows,

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,160
there's some things that he avoids,

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,919
and how we too must take the instruction

102
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,360
and understand that we must have

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
that discipline in our lives.

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
As we continue studying this thought

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,500
from 2 Timothy chapter two,

106
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,760
we come to verse number six,

107
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,920
and the Bible says the husbandman that laboreth

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,359
must be first partaker of the fruits.

109
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,000
Now we understand in verse number three,

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
that the Bible says in verse number one of chapter two,

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,040
the Bible says thou therefore my son be strong

112
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,760
In verse number three, thou therefore endure hardness

114
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,220
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

115
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,440
I submitted to you five, six weeks ago now,

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
as we began studying the second chapter of 2 Timothy,

117
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,079
that this thought of being a good soldier

118
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,160
in these characteristics, five of them,

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,519
that I find in this passage of scripture,

120
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,799
that God gives us that characterize

121
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,179
what does it mean to be a good soldier?

122
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,640
What does it look like to be a good soldier?

123
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,459
And then we've said that those principles

124
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:09,459
are then explained or illustrated throughout the passage.

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
And so as we come to verse number six,

126
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,399
we find that God will use, as he did in verse number five,

127
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,559
the analogy or the illustration of the one

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,519
that was striving for masteries,

129
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,160
or the athlete that was competing in the Isthmian games,

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,559
that we come to verse number six,

131
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,760
and he says the husbandman that laboreth

132
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,799
must be first partaker of the fruits.

133
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,239
As we come to verse number six,

134
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,160
the characteristic that we'll finish up this chapter with

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,799
is this, a good soldier works hard.

136
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,500
A good soldier works hard.

137
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,059
There's something about hardworking.

138
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,660
There's something about giving our all

139
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,339
to the Lord Jesus Christ in working for the master.

140
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,859
As we begin to think about this thought

141
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,540
from verse number six, and we'll look down also

142
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,779
as we conclude this morning in verses 24 through 26,

143
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,500
and deal with this subject matter

144
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,179
of a good soldier works hard.

145
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,299
He's not looking for how he can avoid work

146
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,459
or how he can work a little.

147
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,380
No, he wants to work for his master.

148
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,779
We sang the song last Sunday evening,

149
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,339
work for the night is coming.

150
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,859
And what a challenging song that is

151
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:23,859
to know that one day that our work here on earth will end,

152
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,660
and only done what's done for Christ

153
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
will really matter or count.

154
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,720
And so as we come to this thought this morning,

155
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,179
if you're taking notes, number one,

156
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:36,339
I want you to consider the exhortation to work hard.

157
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,820
We find that throughout the scriptures

158
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,459
that God gives us the exhortation,

159
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,980
he exhorts us, he instructs us,

160
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,739
he commands us to work hard.

161
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:47,220
We live, I believe today, that we live in a time

162
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,260
when hard work is no longer valued as it once was.

163
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,739
In fact, many times when we think

164
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:55,140
about a younger generation that's rising up,

165
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,739
we find that a younger generation has lost a work ethic.

166
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,959
And that's prevalent in our society today.

167
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,179
We see that people, they have this mentality.

168
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,700
Unfortunately, we get into chapter three

169
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,440
and we see why it's the case.

170
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,760
But we find that we live in a time

171
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,059
in which we have a culture, a society that feels entitled.

172
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,399
They've had things just handed to them

173
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,320
and they've not learned how to develop a good work ethic.

174
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,839
And we find that the Bible would instruct us,

175
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,679
exhort us to be hard workers, to work hard for the Lord.

176
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:33,679
The lack of a good work ethic in our society,

177
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:37,940
unfortunately, creeps into our churches as well.

178
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,380
We find that the church has always been given

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,339
the responsibility to influence the culture,

180
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,859
to influence the society.

181
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,720
But if we're honest this morning,

182
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,899
we have had the opportunity to see historically,

183
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,820
to see even in our day to day,

184
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,220
how the society and the culture

185
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,980
is having a great influence on the church.

186
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,140
And it's so vital that we understand

187
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,779
that the church is to influence the culture,

188
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,380
not the other way around.

189
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,299
Consider with me a few thoughts this morning

190
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,119
with regard to the exhortation to work hard.

191
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,760
There are many people that erroneously have the idea

192
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,779
that work was a result of the fall.

193
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,899
But I would submit to you in Genesis chapter two

194
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,339
in verse number 15,

195
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,119
that Adam was placed in the garden by God Almighty.

196
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,179
And God said that he was put there to dress it

197
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,420
and to keep it.

198
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,859
And the word dress it literally means to labor or to work.

199
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,380
That's what the word means, that's what that phrase means.

200
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,539
And so there are times in which we misunderstand the truth.

201
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,020
Yes, work got a whole lot more complicated after the fall

202
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,460
with regard to the curse

203
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,739
and the thorns and thistles and all of that.

204
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,059
But the reality is that we find

205
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,940
that God placed Adam in the garden

206
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,820
according to Genesis 2.15,

207
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,299
to dress it and to keep it.

208
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,659
Who was he doing it for?

209
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,239
He was doing it for God.

210
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,080
He was doing it for God.

211
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,859
God gave him, Adam, that responsibility.

212
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,140
The Bible tells us in Lamentations nine,

213
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,799
a passage of scripture that sometimes

214
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,140
we really just can look over and not focus on the truth.

215
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,500
But the Bible tells us in Lamentations

216
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,619
that we are to work.

217
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:20,880
Notice in Lamentations nine, sorry, Ecclesiastes nine.

218
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,340
I don't know why I wrote down Lamentations.

219
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,919
Ecclesiastes chapter nine and verse number 10,

220
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,520
the Bible says this.

221
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,580
Let me back up.

222
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,419
Ecclesiastes nine and verse 10, there it is.

223
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:36,020
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.

224
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,979
For there's no work, nor device, nor knowledge,

225
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,780
nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.

226
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,099
And so we notice the first part of Ecclesiastes nine, 10.

227
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:49,099
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.

228
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,979
Can I submit to you this morning

229
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:54,900
that our work for God ought to be done with our all?

230
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,739
Because we understand the Bible says,

231
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,739
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.

232
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:04,379
But we understand that when God lets us serve Him,

233
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,379
what a privilege it is, and He deserves our best.

234
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,659
He deserves our absolute best.

235
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,939
Colossians 3 and verse 23 says this,

236
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:15,199
and whatsoever you do, do it heartily,

237
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,419
as to the Lord and not unto men.

238
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,659
I'm working for the Lord.

239
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:25,499
I actually heard a snippet of a testimony this week.

240
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,499
I was moving the church van.

241
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,919
I was not driving anywhere.

242
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,519
I was simply moving it from one place to another,

243
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,199
and in that simple, short period of time

244
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,359
that I was in the church van,

245
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,479
the American Family Radio came on,

246
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:41,459
and there was a man that was giving a testimony,

247
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,479
Alex McFarlane.

248
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,319
Some of you might know him.

249
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,439
I'm not endorsing him.

250
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,839
I don't know all that he believes or all that he teaches,

251
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,779
but he is a prominent speaker.

252
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,199
He's a prominent author.

253
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,039
He's written a lot.

254
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,559
In fact, I have a book or two of his that he's written,

255
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,339
and here's when he was giving a testimony.

256
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,599
He said, you know, when I first started on ministry,

257
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,599
it was amazing that God let me catch this little snippet.

258
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,599
I mean, I was just moving the church van

259
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,939
from the front of the fellowship hall

260
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,199
to where it's parked right now,

261
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,759
and here's what I heard him say.

262
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,399
When I first started on the ministry,

263
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,439
you know what I got to do for God?

264
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,879
I got to clean the bathrooms.

265
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,439
That's what he said, and he said, you know,

266
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,879
I found myself there cleaning the bathroom,

267
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,439
and I remember having this thought,

268
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,159
God allows me to do this for him.

269
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,679
What a perspective.

270
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,159
What a perspective, and he said,

271
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,599
I wanted to clean those bathrooms to the best of my ability.

272
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,479
I wanted to make sure that those bathrooms

273
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,879
in that church building were the cleanest bathrooms

274
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,839
that anyone would ever walk into,

275
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,399
and you see a man that had that perspective.

276
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,559
Well, how do you have that perspective?

277
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,479
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

278
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,359
do it with all thy might, and whatsoever you do,

279
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,839
do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men,

280
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,319
and we see that God has given us this exhortation,

281
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,519
a good soldier, he works hard.

282
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,679
Listen, we'll look at it in just a moment,

283
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,199
but we find that when the Bible talks about a husbandman,

284
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,519
listen, that's hard work.

285
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,199
That's not for the faint of heart.

286
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,439
That is labor, it's intensive,

287
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:14,119
and we find that here we understand that the good soldier,

288
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,439
the example that's being used in verse number six

289
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,899
is still giving that thought with regard

290
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,279
to here the characteristics of a good soldier.

291
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,839
I want to remind you this morning,

292
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,039
1 Corinthians chapter three, if you look there,

293
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,839
and we're gonna look at a verse of Scripture

294
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,359
in 1 Corinthians and also in 2 Corinthians,

295
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,099
because we find that the apostle Paul,

296
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:35,039
God is using him to be able to give some instruction

297
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,259
to the church in Corinth and to help them understand

298
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:42,719
their place and their work with the Lord and for the Lord.

299
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,679
Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

300
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,159
remember, if you have an understanding,

301
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,799
a little bit of a background of the book of 1 Corinthians

302
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,559
or the church in Corinth, it was a divided church.

303
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,279
It was a church that was full of people

304
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,439
that were contentious one with the other,

305
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,459
and they were I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos,

306
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,559
and they had their little groups and cliques and sects,

307
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,999
whatever you want to call them,

308
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,479
and we find that Paul says, who then is Paul?

309
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,359
Who is Apollos?

310
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,659
I mean, we're just ministers,

311
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,799
and he goes through that process,

312
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,519
and he speaks, and notice, and pick it up with me

313
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,159
in verse number four, it says,

314
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,719
and while one saith, I am of Paul,

315
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:20,199
and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?

316
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,059
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos?

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,819
You're not carnal, but ministers by whom you believed

318
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,979
even as the Lord gave to every man,

319
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,579
and then it's interesting that the Apostle Paul

320
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,499
will lead into this passage of scripture,

321
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,179
and he'll use a similar illustration or analogy

322
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,659
of what we read in chapter two of 2 Timothy in verse six

323
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,779
about the husbandman.

324
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,179
Notice what he says, I have planted.

325
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,179
Do you see the connection, the agricultural connection

326
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,099
that he's using?

327
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,899
I have planted, you understand the connection

328
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,019
if you have any understanding of agriculture,

329
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,219
you think about the vegetables or the fruit

330
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,139
that you've eaten this past week,

331
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,619
somebody had to plant a seed somewhere.

332
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,699
And he says, I have planted.

333
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,299
We understand the spiritual connection

334
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:07,939
and the understanding of Jesus saying

335
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,899
that we're to sow the seed of the word of God,

336
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,979
and the seed is the word of God,

337
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:15,499
and he gives that parable, and we understand that,

338
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,500
and here, Paul says, I have planted, Apollos watered.

339
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,619
What good is it if you plant the seed

340
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,539
and then leave it alone, and you do nothing with it,

341
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,339
you don't cultivate it, you don't water it,

342
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,459
you don't care for it?

343
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,459
Well, it's going to, if you live, especially in our area,

344
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:33,339
the hot sun's gonna come out, it's gonna dry that thing up,

345
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,940
you'll water it so that what, you're helping it to grow,

346
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,419
and he says, I have planted, Apollos is watered,

347
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,779
but notice this, God gave the increase.

348
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,459
Aren't you thankful for fruit?

349
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,619
Aren't you thankful for the increase, the yield,

350
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,899
the time of harvest, oftentimes, in fact,

351
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,940
this time of our calendar year is a time

352
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
that we often think of harvest time.

353
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,660
In fact, we were knocking doors yesterday,

354
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,259
Tim was with me as we're knocking doors,

355
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:58,819
another group was out knocking doors,

356
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,940
and some folks doing door hangers yesterday,

357
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,699
trying to get the word into the community,

358
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,459
and we went to one door, and it said, happy harvest,

359
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,380
right on a sign on their front door,

360
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,419
and we understand harvest time, what's harvest time?

361
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,899
Man, we're getting the blessings,

362
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,179
we're bringing in the fruit, the yield,

363
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,579
and harvest time is great,

364
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,899
but understand that harvest time does not come

365
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,380
if there's no sowing time, right?

366
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,660
We like the reaping, but we gotta be faithful

367
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,019
to do the sowing, and we find that that truth is there.

368
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,699
Notice in verse seven, so then neither is he

369
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:30,539
that planteth anything, neither he that watereth,

370
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,819
but God that giveth the increase.

371
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,479
Now, he that planteth and he that watereth are one,

372
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,160
and every man shall receive his own reward

373
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,579
according to his own labor, and then notice this,

374
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,419
I love verse nine of 1 Corinthians chapter three.

375
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,859
Notice what the Bible says, for we are laborers together,

376
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,539
what does it say?

377
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:54,019
With God, so often we think about we're laboring for God,

378
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,699
and there's some truth in that,

379
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,299
but I love the way this says we're laborers together

380
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,380
with God, with God, and he says here,

381
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,459
ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building,

382
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,720
and I wanna rejoice in understanding this morning

383
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,359
that we are laborers together with God.

384
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,859
God has given us the privilege of working for him,

385
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,179
of serving him.

386
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,099
In the book of 2 Corinthians, notice, if you will,

387
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,919
in chapter number six, and we find that in 2 Corinthians,

388
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,399
again, Paul's writing to the same group of people,

389
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,339
this church in Corinth, and he's trying to give them,

390
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,419
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

391
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,380
truth that will help them in understanding their work,

392
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,139
and he says in 2 Corinthians six and verse number one,

393
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:41,139
we then notice, as workers together with him,

394
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,539
who's him, God, he says, beseech you also

395
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,539
that you receive not the grace of God in vain.

396
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,279
He's speaking about himself there,

397
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,619
and those that he's working with,

398
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,739
and how we are workers together with him, with God.

399
00:16:55,739 --> 00:17:00,380
What a great reminder to the church in Corinth.

400
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,779
What a great reminder to the churches

401
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,019
throughout the history of the church age.

402
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,899
What a great reminder for each of us this morning

403
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:10,899
to know that God says we are laborers,

404
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,099
we are workers together with him.

405
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,779
What do you think of when you think about the word labor,

406
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,019
when you think about the word work?

407
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,419
I mean, it's, you gotta exert energy.

408
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,699
You gotta, listen, there's some people

409
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,699
I've said over the years,

410
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,419
man, they're working hard to not work.

411
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,099
You ever see somebody that's doing that kind of thing?

412
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,739
I mean, they're doing their best to look busy,

413
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,619
but they're not doing a whole lot of anything.

414
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,819
You've seen it, I've seen it, I've witnessed it,

415
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,699
but we find as God's people, you've heard the phrase,

416
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,220
we live in northern Virginia,

417
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,059
you've heard the phrase,

418
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,319
it's good enough for government work.

419
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,059
I remember hearing that when I was a kid.

420
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,500
My dad was, of course, in the Marine Corps,

421
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,619
so he worked for the government in some sense,

422
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:48,019
and we understand that.

423
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,459
And there are people that use that phrase,

424
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,899
it's good enough for government work.

425
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,339
I never fully understood what that meant.

426
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,419
Now I have lots of ideas of what that means,

427
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,819
but I've never worked for the government,

428
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,739
so I'll keep my ideas to myself.

429
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,399
But the reality is that, listen,

430
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,000
we ought never say, well, it's good enough for God.

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,419
I'm just gonna mail it in.

432
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,859
Just gonna kinda, no, no, no,

433
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,459
we're working for the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

434
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:11,479
He is worthy of our absolute best.

435
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:14,380
The exhortation to work hard.

436
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,559
Notice with me, number two, the example of hard work.

437
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,079
We consider the exhortation,

438
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,519
but then we consider the example of hard work.

439
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,720
I'm gonna take you to the Old Testament.

440
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,160
Look at the book of Nehemiah this morning,

441
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,779
just for a few minutes, as we consider this example

442
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,119
that God gives us of hard work.

443
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,159
If you were to read the entirety of the book of Nehemiah,

444
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,000
you would see great things that were accomplished

445
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,520
for the cause of God.

446
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,320
We find that Nehemiah begins,

447
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,619
the book begins with Nehemiah inquiring

448
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,539
about the condition of Jerusalem,

449
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,679
understanding what's going on in Jerusalem.

450
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,679
And we find that he receives word

451
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,000
that the city is in great affliction and great reproach,

452
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,479
that the wall of Jerusalem is broken down,

453
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,039
the gates are burned with fire.

454
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,760
I mean, he hears, he receives the report,

455
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,919
and his heart is broken.

456
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,279
We find that Nehemiah, in chapter number one,

457
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,799
he begins to pray, he begins to confess.

458
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,839
He's mourning, and he's fasting,

459
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,839
and he's seeking the face of God.

460
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,599
And God puts within Nehemiah's heart

461
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,080
desire to work for God, to do something for God.

462
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,359
And God put that within Nehemiah's heart,

463
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,640
and he had a desire to go.

464
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,479
But Nehemiah was the cupbearer for Artaxerxes,

465
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,080
and he's there, and he's in the presence of Artaxerxes

466
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
to begin the second chapter,

467
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
and we find that his countenance is, something's different.

468
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,760
He's got, as Artaxerxes would describe it, sorrow of heart.

469
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,440
Well, no doubt he has sorrow of heart

470
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,559
because he received this report,

471
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,839
and he's overwhelmed because of what he hears is going on.

472
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,440
And God's put something within his heart,

473
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,399
and he knows that God's hand is upon him,

474
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:50,580
and he receives, and he gives this information

475
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,719
to Artaxerxes, and he's given the opportunity to go.

476
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:57,359
And we find that as we study through the book of Nehemiah,

477
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,140
that God has put this thing in his heart.

478
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,979
Notice how it's.

479
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:03,659
described for us in chapter 2, in verse number 11.

480
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,339
The Bible says, so I came to Jerusalem.

481
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,699
I was there three days.

482
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:08,939
In verse number 12, notice what the Bible says.

483
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:12,939
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me.

484
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:16,739
Neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart.

485
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:21,339
Notice these words, to do at Jerusalem.

486
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:26,459
God had put something in his heart to do for God.

487
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:30,219
And we find that Nehemiah, over the next period of time,

488
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,059
we don't have time to study the entirety

489
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,939
of the book of Nehemiah here this morning,

490
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:36,579
but we find that he's going to enlist some people

491
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:39,339
to help him do something for God.

492
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:42,099
And the Bible says in verse number 17 of chapter 2,

493
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,379
then said I unto them,

494
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,579
ye see the distress that we are in,

495
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,459
and how Jerusalem lieth waste,

496
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,419
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

497
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,899
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem,

498
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,539
that we be no more a reproach.

499
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:56,939
Listen, that's work.

500
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,099
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem.

501
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,219
I have seen the wall in Jerusalem, I've been there,

502
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,899
I've seen the size of the stones,

503
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,539
and I understand the various periods of time

504
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,179
in which that wall was constructed,

505
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,899
but I submit to you this morning

506
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:14,499
that there was nothing easy about the work

507
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:18,699
that God had put on the heart of Nehemiah to do for God.

508
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,499
And he enlists some people to help him.

509
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,719
You know what the Bible tells us, notice in verse 18,

510
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,939
the Bible says, then I told them of the hand of my God,

511
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,619
which was good upon me, as also the king's words

512
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,899
that he had spoken unto me.

513
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,059
And they said, notice what they said,

514
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,879
let us rise up and build.

515
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,879
So they strengthened their hands for this good work.

516
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,899
We find that there's opposition that comes

517
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,779
and the attack comes.

518
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,459
In chapter four, as we kind of fast forward

519
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:48,659
and look at this example,

520
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,659
considering the example of hard work,

521
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,659
we come to verse number six and the Bible says,

522
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,819
so built we the wall, and all the wall was joined together

523
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,099
into the half thereof.

524
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:02,099
Notice this phrase, for the people had a mind to work.

525
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,439
The people had a mind to work.

526
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,779
The Bible tells us that they were working

527
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,779
with one hand holding a sword, a weapon,

528
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,199
and one hand holding and doing some work over here, why?

529
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,299
Because the enemy, because the opposition.

530
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,079
And you think about the intensity of the work,

531
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,799
you think about what they were exerting,

532
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,959
the energy, the focus.

533
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,699
Listen, they weren't doing it for themselves,

534
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,719
they were doing it for God.

535
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,919
That God would be glorified.

536
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,119
By the way, God was helping them,

537
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,499
God was blessing them, God was giving them the strength

538
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:38,719
to be able to do the work.

539
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,799
Notice with me still here in chapter number four,

540
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,159
as we consider the example of hard work,

541
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,439
we're also reminded that the enemy,

542
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,779
listen, someone always gonna try to stop you.

543
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,539
I was in a restaurant up in Pennsylvania

544
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,299
on Wednesday morning before I came home

545
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:57,659
for the Beacon Conference, a group of preachers

546
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,099
and several of their wives went out

547
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,059
and had breakfast together before everyone

548
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,779
went their own way, and as we were there,

549
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,859
we walked in and on the sign,

550
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:07,299
there were actually signs all over the building,

551
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,579
it was a place run by Mennonites,

552
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,979
and they had some really good sayings in there,

553
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:14,579
little signs, and it said whenever you try

554
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:17,779
to accomplish a good work, be sure there will be people

555
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,219
that tell you it can't work.

556
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:22,579
And man, that one just caught my attention,

557
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,219
a group of preachers, and we looked at that,

558
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,539
and we had a lot of comments to say about that

559
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,499
because there are people that are just doubters sometimes.

560
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,859
The enemy doesn't want us to do the work.

561
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,579
In verse number 11 of chapter four,

562
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,139
the Bible says this, and our adversary said,

563
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:38,859
they shall not know, neither see,

564
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,119
till we come in the midst among them and slay them.

565
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,119
Notice what the Bible says, and cause the work to what?

566
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,879
To cease, not just to slow down, they're not,

567
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,559
listen, the enemy doesn't want the work

568
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,879
to just kinda slow down, the enemy wants the work to cease.

569
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:59,079
I shared that testimony or that prayer request this morning

570
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,479
from the dear brother and his family down in Panama,

571
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,259
his wife and his two little boys,

572
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,919
and those little boys are young boys,

573
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,439
and there's a matter of fear that's welled up

574
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:11,419
in the hearts of those little boys, why?

575
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:12,839
Because our house has been robbed,

576
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,499
and what happens if they come back?

577
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,499
Listen, the enemy doesn't want that church to even start.

578
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:20,099
He wants to get them to give up

579
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,299
before they even have their first service.

580
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,539
But I'm thankful for a man, young man,

581
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,059
I don't know how old he is, he's younger than me,

582
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,779
he's a young man, a really young man

583
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:31,899
if he's younger than me, amen,

584
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:33,579
because I'm still a young man,

585
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:38,299
and the reality is that, he said, God is good,

586
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:42,219
God's gonna take care of it, we're not gonna give up,

587
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,459
we're not gonna throw in the towel,

588
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,939
we're not gonna go back and say, well, I guess,

589
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,699
no, no, no, we're gonna just keep on plugging along, why?

590
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:49,899
Because this work that we're doing

591
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,339
is a good work for God, it's for God.

592
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,139
And we find here that the enemy,

593
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,179
he's always gonna try to stop.

594
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,659
It says that they would cause the work to cease.

595
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,819
But you continue to read through the book of Nehemiah,

596
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,739
you find, again, as I mentioned

597
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,739
throughout the end of the chapter, the fourth chapter,

598
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,419
how that verse 17, it says,

599
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,739
it says, they which build in the wall,

600
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,939
and they that bear burdens with those that laid it,

601
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,339
every one with one of his hands wrought in the work,

602
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,219
and with the other hand held a weapon.

603
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,539
And it says that the builders,

604
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:21,699
every one had a sword girded by his sides,

605
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:26,339
and so built, listen, they were working, they were laboring.

606
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,059
What an example that God gives us

607
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,299
in the book of Nehemiah of hard work.

608
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,179
We come back to our text in 2 Timothy chapter two,

609
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,999
we find that the Bible uses that example,

610
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,839
as we've mentioned already in verse number six,

611
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,279
the husbandmen that laboreth.

612
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,559
You know, that word laboreth is an interesting word,

613
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,279
and we, obviously, I believe we can gather

614
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,779
the understanding of the word

615
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,319
even in our own minds this morning,

616
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,799
but there are times in which a definition of a word

617
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,079
helps us to really understand the depth of the word.

618
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,999
And that definition of the word laboreth,

619
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:04,839
it means to labor with wearisome effort.

620
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,839
It literally carries with it the idea

621
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,439
of growing weary or exhausted.

622
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:13,399
Have you ever worked when you couldn't work anymore?

623
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,239
You know what I mean?

624
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,759
I mean, you've worked so hard, you've labored so hard,

625
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,519
you put all in, and you just couldn't work anymore.

626
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,359
You just had to go and get some rest

627
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,199
so that you could then maybe get up the next day

628
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,719
and do it all over again.

629
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,039
We find here that it says the husbandmen that laboreth.

630
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,839
I've never been a farmer.

631
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,879
I've never, I've spent one little afternoon on a dairy farm

632
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,999
when I was preaching in a church up in New York

633
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,799
right after Holly and I got married

634
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,039
and just filling the pulpit for a church

635
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,559
that didn't have a pastor.

636
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,399
And that fella that invited us,

637
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,679
he and his family invited us to their house for lunch,

638
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,159
and after lunch, he said,

639
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,359
well, it's time to go get the cows.

640
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,359
He said, do you wanna come?

641
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,879
And I said, well, I have nothing but a suit.

642
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,139
He said, well, we're about the same size.

643
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,079
I'll get some clothes for you.

644
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,199
I said, all right, let's go.

645
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,959
That was work.

646
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,759
You know, some cows are hardheaded.

647
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,879
And then one of them cows,

648
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,399
I was trying to get its attention, Armando,

649
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,759
it was like kinda looking at me like, I can take you out.

650
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,079
And I thought, you can, amen.

651
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,719
You're a lot bigger than I am.

652
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,879
But it was work.

653
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:18,239
But you know what I find out about those in dairy farmers,

654
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,199
but not just dairy farmers, those that are crop farmers,

655
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,599
you know what they do?

656
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,499
They work hard.

657
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,519
They work hard.

658
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,719
We go and we pick up the milk at the store.

659
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,519
And you say, some people,

660
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,879
I ain't gonna point anybody out,

661
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:35,839
but some people actually get somebody else

662
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,159
to go pick it up for you and bring it, amen.

663
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,439
And you do that, you know, call ahead

664
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,759
and you just pull into the spot and say, here I am.

665
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,759
And they bring it all out.

666
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,179
I like to go shopping myself,

667
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,119
but I don't like to go milk the cows myself.

668
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,519
But we understand it's labor.

669
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,679
Listen, I remember going to church

670
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,319
with a fella in Pennsylvania

671
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,639
that had a farm over in Delaware.

672
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,639
And he was talking to me about just the daily life

673
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,439
of being a farmer and what he did

674
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,199
in the many hundreds of acres of land that he farmed.

675
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,439
And he talked to me about, listen,

676
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,479
there's a time that you gotta get the seed in the ground,

677
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,119
the sowing time.

678
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,639
Listen, it doesn't matter if you feel tired,

679
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:18,719
it doesn't matter, there's a window of opportunity

680
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,039
and you gotta get it in.

681
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:21,799
And then guess what?

682
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,719
When it's harvest time, when it's time to reap,

683
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,239
it can't be a, well, you know,

684
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,679
I just don't feel like it today.

685
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,439
You know, I think I'm just gonna work for, no, no.

686
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,439
You gotta get it in or you're gonna lose the crop.

687
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,599
And here the Bible says the husbandmen that laboreth.

688
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,599
Listen, these people, Timothy, no doubt, Paul, no doubt,

689
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:46,139
the people in Ephesus that Paul is writing to Timothy

690
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:48,519
as the pastor there in that first century

691
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,000
and obviously for a long time of individuals

692
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,799
reading this portion of scripture,

693
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,279
they knew what it was for a husbandman to labor.

694
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,279
Today, many of us have never been on a farm to work.

695
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
They've gone and seen a farm, not worked a farm.

696
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,440
And here are the example of a good soldier

697
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,880
as it's illustrated through the text of scripture.

698
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,399
He uses in verse five of that athlete

699
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,159
that's competing in the Isthmian games

700
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,479
and then in verse six, the husbandman that's laboring.

701
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:25,919
The athlete in verse five that's working

702
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,260
and competing in those Isthmian games,

703
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,399
he's gotta be disciplined if he wants to win,

704
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,399
if he wants to be crowned, he has to follow the rules.

705
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,199
He has to compete according to the rules

706
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,599
that have been set forth, the guidelines he must,

707
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,139
it says, strive lawfully.

708
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,760
But the husbandmen that laboreth, it's work.

709
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,559
We gotta work for the Lord.

710
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,119
In verse 24 of 2 Timothy,

711
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,159
I believe that I begin to see the labor in ministry.

712
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,399
Remember, if you will, that Paul is writing to Timothy,

713
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,320
his son in the faith.

714
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,959
This is not an epistle.

715
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,099
It's written to a church broadly,

716
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,859
to a church in a particular location.

717
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:06,379
It's written to the pastor, Timothy,

718
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,499
who is the pastor of the church at Ephesus,

719
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,059
and obviously there's much going on,

720
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,799
but I want you to see, if you will,

721
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,319
in verses 24 through 26,

722
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,559
the way that this thought of being a hard worker

723
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,939
in laboring is illustrated

724
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,939
with regard to laboring in ministry.

725
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:21,779
It says in verse 24,

726
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,159
and the servant of the Lord must not strive,

727
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,159
but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach patient.

728
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,559
Notice in verse 25,

729
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,559
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.

730
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,839
That's kind of an interesting phrase

731
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,939
that God gives us there in verse number 25

732
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,359
with regard to having that meekness

733
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,779
to instruct those that oppose themselves.

734
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,599
Listen, it's one thing to instruct people

735
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,159
that want to be instructed.

736
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,759
It's one thing to have somebody come and say,

737
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,879
hey, I want you to teach me.

738
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:57,119
I had somebody that came to me recently and said,

739
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,879
hey, I'd like for you to give me some instruction,

740
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,399
some pointer, some help on my personal walk with God

741
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,499
and my daily devotions.

742
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:05,559
Man, that's exciting.

743
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,439
That's good times.

744
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:09,159
But he says, in meekness instructing those

745
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,439
that oppose themselves.

746
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,959
He said in verse number 24

747
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,199
that we're to be apt to teach patient.

748
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,699
It says, continuing in verse 25,

749
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,799
if God peradventure will give them repentance

750
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,879
to the acknowledging of the truth.

751
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,319
Now, I love that because it says

752
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,639
that give them repentance

753
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,579
to the acknowledging of the truth.

754
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:29,039
Listen, it's about giving the truth.

755
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
It's not about changing the message to appeal to them,

756
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,999
to appease them, to coddle them.

757
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:37,239
No, it's that they might come

758
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:40,319
to the acceptance of the truth.

759
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,639
That's important for us to understand this morning.

760
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,679
A lot of places that have changed the message

761
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,359
because the message hasn't been received by the masses

762
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,439
and that becomes problematic

763
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,719
because God has delivered to us a message

764
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:57,519
that we ought to teach, that we're instructed to teach,

765
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,479
and I'm thankful that his word is truth.

766
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:02,479
Notice in verse 26, they may recover themselves

767
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,439
out of the snare of the devil

768
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,119
who are taken captive by him at his will.

769
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:09,279
Listen, there's spiritual battle that's taking place.

770
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,459
There's spiritual battle.

771
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:13,999
The work of the husbandman is illustrated

772
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,999
in verse number six is a hard work.

773
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,079
It's a wearisome work.

774
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,119
It's a exhausting work,

775
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,439
but the good soldier, the servant of the Lord

776
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,799
as it's referred to in verse number 24

777
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,859
is one that is laboring, that is working.

778
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,959
Listen, the reality this morning

779
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:35,319
is that we are giving the instruction as pastors,

780
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,959
as a spiritual leader,

781
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:39,519
giving the instruction to feed the flock of God,

782
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,599
to labor in the word and in prayer.

783
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,059
It's work, it's work,

784
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,999
and it's not something that you just take lightly.

785
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,679
Listen, God's given all of us a work to do.

786
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,999
He's given us a responsibility.

787
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,879
I think about even in this text of Scripture

788
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,959
in 2 Timothy 2 in verse 15,

789
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,799
the verse that's our memory verse for the month of October.

790
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,119
Study to show thyself approved unto God,

791
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,199
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

792
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,759
rightly dividing the word of truth.

793
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,279
Listen, study.

794
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,919
If you know what, if you think about the word study,

795
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,639
it carries with the idea of work.

796
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:15,359
Studying is work, it's labor.

797
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,839
So we find that there's an exhortation,

798
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,639
there's an example, but notice with me number three.

799
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,559
Consider with me the expectation of those who work hard,

800
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,479
the expectation of those that work hard.

801
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,599
In our text of Scripture in verse number six,

802
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,919
the Bible says the husbandman that laboreth,

803
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,519
and then notice this phrase,

804
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,239
must be first partaker of what?

805
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,759
The fruits.

806
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,519
You know, there's the expectation that the husbandman has.

807
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,359
The husbandman works hard,

808
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,679
but the expectation that there's gonna be fruit,

809
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,239
there's gonna be a reward,

810
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:51,239
if I could use that terminology this morning.

811
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,319
There's going to be something

812
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:56,679
that's going to be the result of his effort.

813
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,199
And we find here this morning as we consider

814
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,759
the expectation of those who work hard

815
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,839
and consider this idea of being a partaker of the fruits

816
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,319
as it says there in verse number six

817
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,359
that he must be first partaker of the fruits.

818
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,759
And you think about that husbandman that's laboring,

819
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,639
and when the harvest comes in, when the crop is ready,

820
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,599
that man, they're being rewarded for their hard work.

821
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,959
What a joy it is.

822
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,599
Brother Armando tells me about the mango trees

823
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,599
and all the other things that he has down there

824
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,479
in Guatemala, and he tells me about,

825
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,879
man, grabbing one of those mangoes right off the tree

826
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,279
and just, it's not like what you buy here.

827
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,479
Listen, I had some pineapple when I was in Panama.

828
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:39,439
I've never tasted pineapple like that before.

829
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,199
You said, I'm being honest with you,

830
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,959
it was like nothing I'd ever tasted before.

831
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,239
It was the bananas.

832
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,759
I said, man, I need one of those bananas.

833
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:47,599
Why?

834
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,439
Because it just looked,

835
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,279
you ever go to the Walmart or the Giant

836
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,439
or wherever you shop, and they're green as green can be,

837
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,639
and they're like, and then they go from green to brown.

838
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,159
Like, what happened to the yellow stage, amen?

839
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,199
You know what I'm saying?

840
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,319
Man, these bananas, Armando, do they not look good?

841
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:01,919
I mean, it is amazing.

842
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,919
But you know, when we're working hard

843
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:11,919
and we're working for the master, we have an expectation.

844
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,519
Here's the amazing thing.

845
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,199
We may not always see the results,

846
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,039
but we can always rejoice in knowing that God is working.

847
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,279
I think about some individuals that plant things.

848
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,039
We've had a garden for a few years,

849
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,319
and over the years, you plant gardens,

850
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,199
you have an opportunity with a vegetable garden

851
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,039
that you're gonna plant the garden,

852
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,319
you're gonna have some fruit,

853
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,839
you're gonna yield some increase

854
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,879
at some point down the road.

855
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,479
But you know, there's some fruit trees.

856
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,759
I read and understand that some of those fruit trees

857
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,959
take up to seven years to produce some fruit.

858
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:43,999
You think about those fruit trees.

859
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:47,079
Listen, it's possible that someone plants a fruit tree

860
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:50,599
and never actually partakes of the fruit.

861
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:52,599
But you know what?

862
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,199
Someone else will be able to.

863
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,799
Someone else will be able to.

864
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,479
And that's an amazing truth, an amazing understanding.

865
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:01,959
I think about David, even as he prepared for the temple.

866
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,439
You know that David worked hard preparing for the temple.

867
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:06,479
He spent those last days of his life, I mean,

868
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,519
really laboring and working hard to build for the temple.

869
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,319
Listen, God had put it in David's heart to build a temple.

870
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,999
And in fact, Nathan immediately said,

871
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,599
do all that's in your heart.

872
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,159
And then God appeared to him that same night and said,

873
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,559
no, David is not the one that's to build the temple.

874
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,799
But we find that as David obeyed the Lord

875
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,599
and understand that he was not permitted

876
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,519
to build the temple, it was still in his heart.

877
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,199
He desired to build a house for the Lord.

878
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,599
He lived in a nice place.

879
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,679
He lived in his own palace.

880
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,599
He's looking around and says, God deserves.

881
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,039
And he wanted to do this work for God.

882
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,679
And God said, no, it's not for you to do,

883
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,799
but for your son Solomon.

884
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,679
You know what David did?

885
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,199
He prepared, he worked hard, he labored

886
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,279
so that everything was in place

887
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,999
for a generation that would follow him.

888
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,999
He labored and he worked hard

889
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:53,359
and he gave of his own resources

890
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,599
so that a temple could be built

891
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,879
that he himself would never personally worship God in.

892
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,999
But he saw beyond his ears.

893
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,879
He saw he was gonna work for God.

894
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,819
And God's work carries on.

895
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:11,519
God's work is bigger than any one of us individually.

896
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,159
God's work is bigger than my life, than your life,

897
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:15,839
than the years of our life.

898
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,319
God's work marches on.

899
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,679
God's work continues.

900
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:21,559
And we see that as we understand the expectation

901
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,199
of those that work hard, consider with me,

902
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,639
1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 10,

903
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,559
what the Bible says about here

904
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,519
with regard to the one that's laboring,

905
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,639
the one that's working.

906
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,239
In 1 Corinthians 9,

907
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,999
choosing the example of the one that plows

908
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,559
and it says in verse 10,

909
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,079
1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 10,

910
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,239
or saith he altogether for our sakes,

911
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,479
for our sakes no doubt this is written,

912
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:53,199
that he that ploweth should plow in what?

913
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,039
Hope.

914
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,159
That he that thresheth in hope

915
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,999
should be partaker of his hope.

916
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:04,559
Now remember, the Bible word hope

917
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,999
is not like we sometimes use the word hope today.

918
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:10,739
Sometimes we use the word hope as I hope this happens

919
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:13,479
and it's just kind of this wishful thinking kind of an idea.

920
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,879
But the word hope biblically has with it,

921
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,759
it carries with it a confident expectation.

922
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,439
We talk about the blessed hope,

923
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:24,799
the fact that Jesus is going to return.

924
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,479
That's not something that I'm just wishing

925
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,519
that Jesus is gonna come back.

926
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,599
No, I have a confident expectation

927
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,919
that my Jesus is coming back.

928
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,759
Amen.

929
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:35,279
I'd be okay if it'd be today, this week, amen.

930
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,919
Praise the Lord, even so come Lord Jesus, amen.

931
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:43,439
And he says he that ploweth, he ploweth in hope.

932
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,839
It says here that he that thresheth in hope

933
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,519
shall be partaker of his hope.

934
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,579
And we see that expectation of hard work.

935
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,019
We find in 1 Corinthians as we make the analogy

936
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,199
and cross over to our work for the Lord

937
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,239
and understanding the principles

938
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,239
that God has given us in his word

939
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,959
and now beginning to look at the work

940
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,319
that we're doing for God.

941
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,079
In 1 Corinthians 15, it's a great chapter

942
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,959
dealing with the resurrection

943
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,639
and what a great chapter it is.

944
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,919
But in verse number 58, as he comes to the end

945
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:15,359
of all of this with regard to the resurrection

946
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,239
that this mortal shall put on immortality,

947
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,839
that this corruption shall put on incorruption,

948
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,239
that we labor for the Lord.

949
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,359
He says, therefore, in verse 58,

950
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,799
my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable,

951
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,759
always abounding in what?

952
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,399
In the work of the Lord.

953
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,799
Why?

954
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:36,639
For as much as ye notice this phrase, as ye know.

955
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:42,479
For as much as ye know that your labor

956
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,919
is not in vain in the Lord.

957
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,339
Isn't that a great truth?

958
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:52,639
So often we can rush over those little words,

959
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,999
we know, ye know.

960
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,719
Listen, God wants us to have the understanding

961
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,639
that the work that we're doing for him

962
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,359
is not a work that's in vain.

963
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,599
vain. We do a work for Him. Listen, I was talking to Ronnie last week. I didn't go

964
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,999
door-knocking with Ronnie yesterday. I went with Tim, but last week Ronnie and I

965
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,559
went and we did some follow-up visits for some folks that have visited the church

966
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,479
and were out, and Ronnie and I were kind of striking out. I mean, people weren't

967
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:22,279
home, and I said, man, Ronnie, I'm sorry, like, no one's home and no one to talk to.

968
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:24,999
And you know what Ronnie said to me? It was an encouragement. He said, you know,

969
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:29,159
Pastor, he said, it's not about the results. It's about the work that we're

970
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,559
doing for God. And it was a good reminder for me. He said, you need a reminder

971
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:39,879
sometimes? Yeah, and so do you. Amen? Listen, we don't always see the results,

972
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:46,039
but we can be confident knowing that God is always working. Testimonies of people

973
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,039
over the years that have been prayed for, that have been sought to be ministered

974
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,839
to, that took years and years and years for them to respond to the call of God,

975
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:03,959
to the sweet call of, come unto me. Just keep laboring. Why? Because our labor is

976
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:10,079
not in vain in the Lord, and we work hard for the Lord. He's a good soldier.

977
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,919
A good soldier works hard. Galatians 6, the book of Galatians in the sixth

978
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:25,479
chapter, we read a great truth in verse number 7 that we often use in the

979
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:30,519
negative, but not so much in the positive. But the reality is that the text of

980
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,759
Scripture, if you read verse 8 and 9, it deals with both the negative and the

981
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,639
positive. And here's the truth that we deal with in verse 7.

982
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,479
Be not deceived. God does not mock whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also

983
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:47,279
reap. Sowing and reaping, the principle that God has set forth, and oftentimes

984
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:53,519
that principle is used to talk about negative sowing, and you're going to reap.

985
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,479
We understand that, and it's certainly applicable, and it's important we see in

986
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,799
verse 8, but I want you to notice in verse 8, for he that soweth to his flesh

987
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:04,159
shall of the flesh reap corruption. Now that's the negative side of it. Amen?

988
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,279
The preacher of yesteryear said someone's out all week sowing seeds of rebellion

989
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,999
and sowing bad seeds, and then he comes to church on Sunday and he prays for

990
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:18,679
crop failure. And I thought that was kind of comical to think about the way that

991
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:23,759
they use that terminology. Listen, what you sow you're going to reap. But verse

992
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:29,239
number 8 continues and says this, but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the

993
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:36,479
Spirit reap life everlasting, and let us not be weary in well-doing. I don't know

994
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:42,959
about you, but sometimes if we're not careful, we can grow weary. So we're

995
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,199
talking about the work of the Lord. You're not seeing the results. You're

996
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:52,999
not seeing the...you can grow weary. Grow weary. But he says this, and let us not be

997
00:42:52,999 --> 00:43:01,919
weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. God wants us

998
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:08,279
to work till we can work no more. He wants us to work till we can work. Some

999
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:13,199
might say, well, I can't work like I used to. But you can still work. I don't have

1000
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,399
as much energy as I used to have. That's okay. Use what energy you have. Right? We

1001
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:26,359
work till we can work no more. When my life work is ended, is that not what the

1002
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:32,999
songwriter said? Listen, God has a work for us to do. And we need to work hard for our

1003
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:39,799
Master. A good soldier works hard. We notice in our text of Scripture, just as there's

1004
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:45,799
an expectation of the husbandman that he's going to be a partaker of the fruits, that

1005
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:51,399
there ought to be an expectation of us as the people of God, that as we work for our

1006
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:57,719
Master, that our Master sees our work and that He will reward us accordingly. He sees

1007
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,759
our work. Our work is not in vain in the Lord. And He'll reward us. You may not see the

1008
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:10,639
reward. You may not see the fruit today. But I think we're going to see some people in

1009
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:16,839
heaven one day. We're going to see some people in heaven one day that are the fruit of our

1010
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:23,479
labor, that we never get the opportunity to meet them here. We shared a gospel witness

1011
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:27,639
with them. We shared a tract with them. Maybe we put a gospel tract or a book of Romans

1012
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,519
together that went to the other side of the world. Maybe we paid for a Bible that was

1013
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:39,519
printed and sent to a school somewhere in Papua New Guinea or a Bible that we paid for

1014
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,839
to be sent and put into a home of somebody in Samoa that we'll never meet. But we're

1015
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,159
laboring. We're working. We're going to do some work this week on Thursday and Friday.

1016
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,959
You say, why don't we do a scripture assembly? Can't they find machines to do that? Yeah,

1017
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:58,359
they can actually. A lot of machines that do that stuff. But you know, it's something

1018
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:06,239
precious to me about being able to sit down and put my hands to work, to tear apart scripture,

1019
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,639
to put it together. I don't say, those of you that know, we're not tearing it apart

1020
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:16,199
like destroying it. It comes off the printing press and the signature has to be torn and

1021
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:23,239
stuffed in. And it's work. And if you sit at that table for a few hours and you're working,

1022
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:27,079
you get up and your shoulders might hurt a little bit. But listen, I'm thankful that

1023
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,519
my shoulders hurt a little bit because I was doing some work for God. And if there's somebody

1024
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,319
that's going to get a gospel witness that maybe has never heard the truth that God loves

1025
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:46,719
them, our labor is not in vain. Let me remind you this morning, in Revelation 2 and 3, we

1026
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:54,079
read of seven churches. Those seven churches are, I believe, and we'll start a series in

1027
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,599
the book of Revelation here next Sunday evening, actually. And I believe, and we'll get there

1028
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,319
in short order as we begin seeing those seven churches in the beginning of chapter two.

1029
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,079
The church at Ephesus is actually the first church that's mentioned. I believe that all

1030
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,199
those churches are real, literal churches that existed at the time of the writing. But

1031
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:20,679
I also believe that those churches are really pictures of the church age. I believe that

1032
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:25,639
those churches are helping us understand that throughout the church age that every church

1033
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:31,599
is going to have some aspect of resemblance to one of these churches, maybe a mix of some

1034
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,679
of these churches. I do not believe, some people would teach and they believe that we're

1035
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,000
living the seventh church, the church of the Laodiceans, that we're living in the Laodicean

1036
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,559
church age, and therefore every church has to be like the church of Laodicea. I don't

1037
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,599
believe that. If I did, I'd go do something else. I'm just being honest with you. Because

1038
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,159
the church of Laodicean was a church that was full of everything. They didn't need anything.

1039
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,959
They didn't even need God. God was on the outside of their church knocking because He

1040
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:04,479
wanted to have fellowship with them. But I want to remind you of something of those

1041
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:11,519
seven churches, and I gave all of that information to make the full application. God says to

1042
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:22,039
every one of those churches, I know thy works. The message to every church is not the same.

1043
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,839
If you read all of those in chapter 2 and 3, those seven churches, the message to each

1044
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:33,079
of them is not the same. But one consistent truth that's given to every one of those

1045
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:40,039
churches is, I know thy works. I would submit to you this morning that God knew the works

1046
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,959
of those literal churches, but God knows the work of every church throughout the church

1047
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:50,559
age. It's as if He could say this morning, and I do not think it would be a stretch at

1048
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:59,879
all to say, Fellowship Baptist Church, I know thy works. Can I tell you this morning

1049
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:04,759
that that ought to bring to each of us a mix of emotions. It ought to cause us to rejoice

1050
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:09,879
that God knows what we're doing for Him, but it ought to cause us to really examine and

1051
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:16,119
evaluate, how's my work for God? Is God pleased with my work? Does God see my work as a work

1052
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:26,559
that is just all in? I mean, I'm working hard for the Lord. I believe that as God's people,

1053
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,079
we should strive for excellence. Can I say this? Our God is worthy of our full effort.

1054
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,719
He's worthy of it. We ought to strive for excellence as the people of God. It ought

1055
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,839
to be, I worked in this corporate world for years. I had the privilege of working in the

1056
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:51,079
corporate world for years. The last company that I worked for was Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation.

1057
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,399
And as I examined my life at that point, as I would examine my life today, my work for

1058
00:48:55,399 --> 00:49:04,159
Sikorsky should never have been more than my work for God. He's worthy of my effort.

1059
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,839
I shouldn't work harder for my employer than I work for my Savior. I understand the hours

1060
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:16,159
may be different, but I'm saying I ought to work hard for my God. I ought to work hard

1061
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:21,000
for my God. He's worthy of it. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving

1062
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,659
us. We thank you for the privilege of knowing you. We've considered these five characteristics

1063
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:32,159
over these last weeks. What does it mean to be a good soldier? Today we finish this thought,

1064
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:39,279
this series, mini-series, if you will, with a charge to work hard. Lord, I thank you

1065
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:45,159
for those that are laboring together with you here in our church. And I pray, God, that

1066
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:48,919
you'd help each one of us as individuals, even as we started the service by singing

1067
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:54,880
that song, Is Your All, on the altar, that we would individually examine our work for

1068
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,760
you. How are we doing? Are we laboring? Are we working for the Master?

1069
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,600
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to follow the exhortation, Lord, that we'd see the example

1070
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:15,200
and follow that example, that we would have the expectation of the rewards, the fruits

1071
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,200
of our labor.

1072
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,360
Would you move and work as only you can through this time of invitation, we'll thank you for

1073
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,160
all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
