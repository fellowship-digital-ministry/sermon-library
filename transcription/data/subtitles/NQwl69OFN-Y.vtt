00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
chapter number two this morning,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.519
2 Timothy chapter number two,

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.400
and I'm thankful for the opportunity

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.439
that we have to gather to study the precious word of God

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.319
and how blessed we are to have Bibles

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.299
that we can read and study and share the truth

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.239
of God's word with those that we come in contact with.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.219
And for the last several weeks now,

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.239
we've had the opportunity to be studying here

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.559
through 2 Timothy chapter number two.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course, our theme for this year is continue.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.659
We're nearing the end of the year.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.860
We've studied through 1 Timothy

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.860
and now making our way through 2 Timothy

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.580
as we see a recurring thought or theme

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.659
in these two letters that the apostle Paul

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.740
sent to Timothy, his own son in the faith.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.619
And really that theme is as we've had

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.740
for our calendar year, continue.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.220
Though the difficulties are there,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.740
though the opposition is there,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.819
though the heartaches are there,

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.919
continue, continue to serve the Lord,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.240
continue to live for Him.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.060
And I find that as we have been studying now,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.900
this is our fifth lesson from 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.700
the fifth message from this passage of scripture,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.139
as we have dealt with the subject of a good soldier.

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:09.699
I hope as we've mentioned many times now

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:13.019
that both you and I have that desire

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:15.139
that we would be a good soldier,

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.019
not simply being content with the reality

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:19.220
that we are soldiers.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.199
If you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:22.739
as your personal savior,

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.620
you were enlisted into the army of God

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.819
and you are a soldier of God.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.779
But we've had the opportunity as we've studied

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:30.139
through this portion of scripture

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.139
to understand that the Lord tells us

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:37.260
that there's this phrase of being a good soldier,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.699
not just being a soldier, but being a good soldier.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.139
And we've noted four characteristics

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.180
over the past four messages.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.019
And we said this from verse number three,

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.459
that a good soldier endures hardness.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.400
There'll be opposition, there'll be difficulty.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.059
I said this, that a soldier is a soldier

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.779
and some people have had the idea

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.339
that they wanna be a soldier, but they don't want conflict.

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.099
But the reality is that the soldier,

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.980
they don't want battle,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.339
but the soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:09.580
we understand that we are engaged in spiritual battle,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.880
spiritual warfare, and we need to endure hardness.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.460
We said this, that a good soldier,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.899
according to verse number four,

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.979
he avoids distractions.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.759
And oh, is it not true that the distractions abound?

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.300
The enemy wants us to be distracted

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.020
from doing what God has commanded us to do.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.679
We find that even in battle,

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.339
that the enemy sometimes will try to distract

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.940
through some type of decoy and what have you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.660
in order to get the attention of the opposing army

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.080
to be distracted while something's taking place over here.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.759
And we see even in the spiritual realm

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.919
that there are many distractions.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.360
And a good soldier, he avoids distraction.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.639
We said a good soldier from verse number four,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.339
that he seeks to please his master.

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.520
Oh, I hope that your goal and your desire,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.080
we think about the Christian life

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.279
and understanding that if you're saved this morning,

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.600
that you'll stand before the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.000
at the judgment seat of Christ, the bema.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.520
And I hope as we see often in the New Testament

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.240
and the gospel accounts that we'll hear,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.240
well done, thou good and faithful servant,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.919
that we live our lives in such a way

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.080
that we desire to please the Lord.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.679
You know, some people live trying to please others.

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.559
Some people try to please whoever it might be,

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.479
try to please the masses, the crowds, whatever it might be.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.279
I have learned in life, you can't please everyone, amen.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.839
You can't please everyone.

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.619
But I found that instead of trying to please people,

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.199
to please the crowds, the masses,

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.759
that if we can just live our lives to please the Lord,

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.320
because the reality is that it's so much more important

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.839
that God is pleased with us

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.240
than that the people are pleased with us.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.839
And we must live with that understanding.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.039
Last week, we dealt with the subject in verse number five,

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.800
and we said that a good soldier is disciplined,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.320
and that discipline in the life of a good soldier

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.240
and how the good soldier, the disciplined soldier,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.160
there's some things that he flees,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.600
there's some things that he follows,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.160
there's some things that he avoids,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.919
and how we too must take the instruction

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.360
and understand that we must have

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.040
that discipline in our lives.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.640
As we continue studying this thought

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.500
from 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.760
we come to verse number six,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.920
and the Bible says the husbandman that laboreth

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.359
must be first partaker of the fruits.

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:31.000
Now we understand in verse number three,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600
that the Bible says in verse number one of chapter two,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.040
the Bible says thou therefore my son be strong

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.760
In verse number three, thou therefore endure hardness

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.220
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.440
I submitted to you five, six weeks ago now,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.440
as we began studying the second chapter of 2 Timothy,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.079
that this thought of being a good soldier

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.160
in these characteristics, five of them,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.519
that I find in this passage of scripture,

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.799
that God gives us that characterize

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.179
what does it mean to be a good soldier?

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.640
What does it look like to be a good soldier?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.459
And then we've said that those principles

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.459
are then explained or illustrated throughout the passage.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.880
And so as we come to verse number six,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.399
we find that God will use, as he did in verse number five,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.559
the analogy or the illustration of the one

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.519
that was striving for masteries,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:24.160
or the athlete that was competing in the Isthmian games,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.559
that we come to verse number six,

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.760
and he says the husbandman that laboreth

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.799
must be first partaker of the fruits.

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.239
As we come to verse number six,

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:36.160
the characteristic that we'll finish up this chapter with

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.799
is this, a good soldier works hard.

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:41.500
A good soldier works hard.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.059
There's something about hardworking.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.660
There's something about giving our all

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.339
to the Lord Jesus Christ in working for the master.

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.859
As we begin to think about this thought

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:55.540
from verse number six, and we'll look down also

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.779
as we conclude this morning in verses 24 through 26,

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.500
and deal with this subject matter

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.179
of a good soldier works hard.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.299
He's not looking for how he can avoid work

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.459
or how he can work a little.

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.380
No, he wants to work for his master.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.779
We sang the song last Sunday evening,

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.339
work for the night is coming.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.859
And what a challenging song that is

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:23.859
to know that one day that our work here on earth will end,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.660
and only done what's done for Christ

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.660
will really matter or count.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.720
And so as we come to this thought this morning,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.179
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:36.339
I want you to consider the exhortation to work hard.

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.820
We find that throughout the scriptures

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.459
that God gives us the exhortation,

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:41.980
he exhorts us, he instructs us,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.739
he commands us to work hard.

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:47.220
We live, I believe today, that we live in a time

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.260
when hard work is no longer valued as it once was.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.739
In fact, many times when we think

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:55.140
about a younger generation that's rising up,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.739
we find that a younger generation has lost a work ethic.

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.959
And that's prevalent in our society today.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:06.179
We see that people, they have this mentality.

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:07.700
Unfortunately, we get into chapter three

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.440
and we see why it's the case.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.760
But we find that we live in a time

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.059
in which we have a culture, a society that feels entitled.

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:18.399
They've had things just handed to them

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.320
and they've not learned how to develop a good work ethic.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.839
And we find that the Bible would instruct us,

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.679
exhort us to be hard workers, to work hard for the Lord.

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:33.679
The lack of a good work ethic in our society,

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:37.940
unfortunately, creeps into our churches as well.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.380
We find that the church has always been given

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.339
the responsibility to influence the culture,

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.859
to influence the society.

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.720
But if we're honest this morning,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.899
we have had the opportunity to see historically,

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:51.820
to see even in our day to day,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.220
how the society and the culture

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.980
is having a great influence on the church.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.140
And it's so vital that we understand

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.779
that the church is to influence the culture,

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:04.380
not the other way around.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.299
Consider with me a few thoughts this morning

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:10.119
with regard to the exhortation to work hard.

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.760
There are many people that erroneously have the idea

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.779
that work was a result of the fall.

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:17.899
But I would submit to you in Genesis chapter two

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.339
in verse number 15,

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:23.119
that Adam was placed in the garden by God Almighty.

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:26.179
And God said that he was put there to dress it

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:27.420
and to keep it.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.859
And the word dress it literally means to labor or to work.

00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:34.380
That's what the word means, that's what that phrase means.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.539
And so there are times in which we misunderstand the truth.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.020
Yes, work got a whole lot more complicated after the fall

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.460
with regard to the curse

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.739
and the thorns and thistles and all of that.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.059
But the reality is that we find

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:51.940
that God placed Adam in the garden

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.820
according to Genesis 2.15,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.299
to dress it and to keep it.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.659
Who was he doing it for?

00:08:57.659 --> 00:08:59.239
He was doing it for God.

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:00.080
He was doing it for God.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.859
God gave him, Adam, that responsibility.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.140
The Bible tells us in Lamentations nine,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.799
a passage of scripture that sometimes

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:14.140
we really just can look over and not focus on the truth.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.500
But the Bible tells us in Lamentations

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.619
that we are to work.

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:20.880
Notice in Lamentations nine, sorry, Ecclesiastes nine.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.340
I don't know why I wrote down Lamentations.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.919
Ecclesiastes chapter nine and verse number 10,

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.520
the Bible says this.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.580
Let me back up.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.419
Ecclesiastes nine and verse 10, there it is.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:36.020
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.979
For there's no work, nor device, nor knowledge,

00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:40.780
nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.099
And so we notice the first part of Ecclesiastes nine, 10.

00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:49.099
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:50.979
Can I submit to you this morning

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:54.900
that our work for God ought to be done with our all?

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.739
Because we understand the Bible says,

00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:00.739
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:04.379
But we understand that when God lets us serve Him,

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:08.379
what a privilege it is, and He deserves our best.

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.659
He deserves our absolute best.

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:12.939
Colossians 3 and verse 23 says this,

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:15.199
and whatsoever you do, do it heartily,

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:19.419
as to the Lord and not unto men.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.659
I'm working for the Lord.

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:25.499
I actually heard a snippet of a testimony this week.

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:27.499
I was moving the church van.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:28.919
I was not driving anywhere.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.519
I was simply moving it from one place to another,

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:34.199
and in that simple, short period of time

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:36.359
that I was in the church van,

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:38.479
the American Family Radio came on,

00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:41.459
and there was a man that was giving a testimony,

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:42.479
Alex McFarlane.

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:43.319
Some of you might know him.

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.439
I'm not endorsing him.

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:46.839
I don't know all that he believes or all that he teaches,

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.779
but he is a prominent speaker.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.199
He's a prominent author.

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:52.039
He's written a lot.

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.559
In fact, I have a book or two of his that he's written,

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.339
and here's when he was giving a testimony.

00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:58.599
He said, you know, when I first started on ministry,

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:01.599
it was amazing that God let me catch this little snippet.

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.599
I mean, I was just moving the church van

00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:04.939
from the front of the fellowship hall

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:06.199
to where it's parked right now,

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:07.759
and here's what I heard him say.

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.399
When I first started on the ministry,

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.439
you know what I got to do for God?

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:13.879
I got to clean the bathrooms.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:16.439
That's what he said, and he said, you know,

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:18.879
I found myself there cleaning the bathroom,

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.439
and I remember having this thought,

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:24.159
God allows me to do this for him.

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:27.679
What a perspective.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:30.159
What a perspective, and he said,

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:34.599
I wanted to clean those bathrooms to the best of my ability.

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:36.479
I wanted to make sure that those bathrooms

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:38.879
in that church building were the cleanest bathrooms

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.839
that anyone would ever walk into,

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:43.399
and you see a man that had that perspective.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.559
Well, how do you have that perspective?

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.479
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:49.359
do it with all thy might, and whatsoever you do,

00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:52.839
do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men,

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:56.319
and we see that God has given us this exhortation,

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.519
a good soldier, he works hard.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.679
Listen, we'll look at it in just a moment,

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.199
but we find that when the Bible talks about a husbandman,

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:06.519
listen, that's hard work.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:08.199
That's not for the faint of heart.

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:10.439
That is labor, it's intensive,

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:14.119
and we find that here we understand that the good soldier,

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:16.439
the example that's being used in verse number six

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:18.899
is still giving that thought with regard

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:21.279
to here the characteristics of a good soldier.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.839
I want to remind you this morning,

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:25.039
1 Corinthians chapter three, if you look there,

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:26.839
and we're gonna look at a verse of Scripture

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:29.359
in 1 Corinthians and also in 2 Corinthians,

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:31.099
because we find that the apostle Paul,

00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:35.039
God is using him to be able to give some instruction

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:38.259
to the church in Corinth and to help them understand

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:42.719
their place and their work with the Lord and for the Lord.

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:44.679
Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:47.159
remember, if you have an understanding,

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:49.799
a little bit of a background of the book of 1 Corinthians

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:52.559
or the church in Corinth, it was a divided church.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:55.279
It was a church that was full of people

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.439
that were contentious one with the other,

00:12:57.439 --> 00:12:59.459
and they were I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos,

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:02.559
and they had their little groups and cliques and sects,

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:03.999
whatever you want to call them,

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.479
and we find that Paul says, who then is Paul?

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:07.359
Who is Apollos?

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:08.659
I mean, we're just ministers,

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:10.799
and he goes through that process,

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:13.519
and he speaks, and notice, and pick it up with me

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.159
in verse number four, it says,

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.719
and while one saith, I am of Paul,

00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:20.199
and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.059
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos?

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:23.819
You're not carnal, but ministers by whom you believed

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:25.979
even as the Lord gave to every man,

00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:28.579
and then it's interesting that the Apostle Paul

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:31.499
will lead into this passage of scripture,

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:34.179
and he'll use a similar illustration or analogy

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:37.659
of what we read in chapter two of 2 Timothy in verse six

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:38.779
about the husbandman.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:42.179
Notice what he says, I have planted.

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:45.179
Do you see the connection, the agricultural connection

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:46.099
that he's using?

00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:48.899
I have planted, you understand the connection

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:52.019
if you have any understanding of agriculture,

00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:54.219
you think about the vegetables or the fruit

00:13:54.219 --> 00:13:56.139
that you've eaten this past week,

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:58.619
somebody had to plant a seed somewhere.

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:01.699
And he says, I have planted.

00:14:01.699 --> 00:14:04.299
We understand the spiritual connection

00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:07.939
and the understanding of Jesus saying

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:10.899
that we're to sow the seed of the word of God,

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:12.979
and the seed is the word of God,

00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:15.499
and he gives that parable, and we understand that,

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:20.500
and here, Paul says, I have planted, Apollos watered.

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.619
What good is it if you plant the seed

00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:24.539
and then leave it alone, and you do nothing with it,

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:26.339
you don't cultivate it, you don't water it,

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:27.459
you don't care for it?

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:30.459
Well, it's going to, if you live, especially in our area,

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:33.339
the hot sun's gonna come out, it's gonna dry that thing up,

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.940
you'll water it so that what, you're helping it to grow,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.419
and he says, I have planted, Apollos is watered,

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:42.779
but notice this, God gave the increase.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:44.459
Aren't you thankful for fruit?

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.619
Aren't you thankful for the increase, the yield,

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.899
the time of harvest, oftentimes, in fact,

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:51.940
this time of our calendar year is a time

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.940
that we often think of harvest time.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.660
In fact, we were knocking doors yesterday,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.259
Tim was with me as we're knocking doors,

00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:58.819
another group was out knocking doors,

00:14:58.819 --> 00:15:00.940
and some folks doing door hangers yesterday,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.699
trying to get the word into the community,

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:05.459
and we went to one door, and it said, happy harvest,

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:07.380
right on a sign on their front door,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.419
and we understand harvest time, what's harvest time?

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:11.899
Man, we're getting the blessings,

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:14.179
we're bringing in the fruit, the yield,

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.579
and harvest time is great,

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.899
but understand that harvest time does not come

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.380
if there's no sowing time, right?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.660
We like the reaping, but we gotta be faithful

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.019
to do the sowing, and we find that that truth is there.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.699
Notice in verse seven, so then neither is he

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:30.539
that planteth anything, neither he that watereth,

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.819
but God that giveth the increase.

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:36.479
Now, he that planteth and he that watereth are one,

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:38.160
and every man shall receive his own reward

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.579
according to his own labor, and then notice this,

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:43.419
I love verse nine of 1 Corinthians chapter three.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:47.859
Notice what the Bible says, for we are laborers together,

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:49.539
what does it say?

00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:54.019
With God, so often we think about we're laboring for God,

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:55.699
and there's some truth in that,

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:58.299
but I love the way this says we're laborers together

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:02.380
with God, with God, and he says here,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.459
ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building,

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.720
and I wanna rejoice in understanding this morning

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.359
that we are laborers together with God.

00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:16.859
God has given us the privilege of working for him,

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:18.179
of serving him.

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:20.099
In the book of 2 Corinthians, notice, if you will,

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:22.919
in chapter number six, and we find that in 2 Corinthians,

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:25.399
again, Paul's writing to the same group of people,

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.339
this church in Corinth, and he's trying to give them,

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:30.419
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:33.380
truth that will help them in understanding their work,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.139
and he says in 2 Corinthians six and verse number one,

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:41.139
we then notice, as workers together with him,

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:44.539
who's him, God, he says, beseech you also

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:48.539
that you receive not the grace of God in vain.

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:50.279
He's speaking about himself there,

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:51.619
and those that he's working with,

00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:55.739
and how we are workers together with him, with God.

00:16:55.739 --> 00:17:00.380
What a great reminder to the church in Corinth.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.779
What a great reminder to the churches

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:05.019
throughout the history of the church age.

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:07.899
What a great reminder for each of us this morning

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:10.899
to know that God says we are laborers,

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:14.099
we are workers together with him.

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:16.779
What do you think of when you think about the word labor,

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:18.019
when you think about the word work?

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:21.419
I mean, it's, you gotta exert energy.

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:22.699
You gotta, listen, there's some people

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:23.699
I've said over the years,

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:26.419
man, they're working hard to not work.

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:28.099
You ever see somebody that's doing that kind of thing?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.739
I mean, they're doing their best to look busy,

00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:31.619
but they're not doing a whole lot of anything.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.819
You've seen it, I've seen it, I've witnessed it,

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:36.699
but we find as God's people, you've heard the phrase,

00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:38.220
we live in northern Virginia,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.059
you've heard the phrase,

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.319
it's good enough for government work.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.059
I remember hearing that when I was a kid.

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:44.500
My dad was, of course, in the Marine Corps,

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.619
so he worked for the government in some sense,

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.019
and we understand that.

00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:49.459
And there are people that use that phrase,

00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:50.899
it's good enough for government work.

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:52.339
I never fully understood what that meant.

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:54.419
Now I have lots of ideas of what that means,

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:55.819
but I've never worked for the government,

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.739
so I'll keep my ideas to myself.

00:17:57.739 --> 00:17:59.399
But the reality is that, listen,

00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:02.000
we ought never say, well, it's good enough for God.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.419
I'm just gonna mail it in.

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:04.859
Just gonna kinda, no, no, no,

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:07.459
we're working for the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:18:07.459 --> 00:18:11.479
He is worthy of our absolute best.

00:18:11.479 --> 00:18:14.380
The exhortation to work hard.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.559
Notice with me, number two, the example of hard work.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:19.079
We consider the exhortation,

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:21.519
but then we consider the example of hard work.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:22.720
I'm gonna take you to the Old Testament.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.160
Look at the book of Nehemiah this morning,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.779
just for a few minutes, as we consider this example

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:30.119
that God gives us of hard work.

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:33.159
If you were to read the entirety of the book of Nehemiah,

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:36.000
you would see great things that were accomplished

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.520
for the cause of God.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.320
We find that Nehemiah begins,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.619
the book begins with Nehemiah inquiring

00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:44.539
about the condition of Jerusalem,

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:46.679
understanding what's going on in Jerusalem.

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:50.679
And we find that he receives word

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:54.000
that the city is in great affliction and great reproach,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.479
that the wall of Jerusalem is broken down,

00:18:56.479 --> 00:18:58.039
the gates are burned with fire.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.760
I mean, he hears, he receives the report,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.919
and his heart is broken.

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:04.279
We find that Nehemiah, in chapter number one,

00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:06.799
he begins to pray, he begins to confess.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:08.839
He's mourning, and he's fasting,

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:10.839
and he's seeking the face of God.

00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:13.599
And God puts within Nehemiah's heart

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.080
desire to work for God, to do something for God.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.359
And God put that within Nehemiah's heart,

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.640
and he had a desire to go.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.479
But Nehemiah was the cupbearer for Artaxerxes,

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.080
and he's there, and he's in the presence of Artaxerxes

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.320
to begin the second chapter,

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.080
and we find that his countenance is, something's different.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.760
He's got, as Artaxerxes would describe it, sorrow of heart.

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.440
Well, no doubt he has sorrow of heart

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.559
because he received this report,

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.839
and he's overwhelmed because of what he hears is going on.

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:45.440
And God's put something within his heart,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.399
and he knows that God's hand is upon him,

00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:50.580
and he receives, and he gives this information

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.719
to Artaxerxes, and he's given the opportunity to go.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:57.359
And we find that as we study through the book of Nehemiah,

00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:00.140
that God has put this thing in his heart.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.979
Notice how it's.

00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:03.659
described for us in chapter 2, in verse number 11.

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:05.339
The Bible says, so I came to Jerusalem.

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:06.699
I was there three days.

00:20:06.699 --> 00:20:08.939
In verse number 12, notice what the Bible says.

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:12.939
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me.

00:20:12.939 --> 00:20:16.739
Neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart.

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:21.339
Notice these words, to do at Jerusalem.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:26.459
God had put something in his heart to do for God.

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:30.219
And we find that Nehemiah, over the next period of time,

00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:32.059
we don't have time to study the entirety

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:33.939
of the book of Nehemiah here this morning,

00:20:33.939 --> 00:20:36.579
but we find that he's going to enlist some people

00:20:36.579 --> 00:20:39.339
to help him do something for God.

00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:42.099
And the Bible says in verse number 17 of chapter 2,

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:43.379
then said I unto them,

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:45.579
ye see the distress that we are in,

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.459
and how Jerusalem lieth waste,

00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:49.419
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:52.899
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem,

00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:55.539
that we be no more a reproach.

00:20:55.539 --> 00:20:56.939
Listen, that's work.

00:20:57.859 --> 00:21:01.099
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem.

00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:04.219
I have seen the wall in Jerusalem, I've been there,

00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:05.899
I've seen the size of the stones,

00:21:05.899 --> 00:21:08.539
and I understand the various periods of time

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.179
in which that wall was constructed,

00:21:10.179 --> 00:21:11.899
but I submit to you this morning

00:21:11.899 --> 00:21:14.499
that there was nothing easy about the work

00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:18.699
that God had put on the heart of Nehemiah to do for God.

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:20.499
And he enlists some people to help him.

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:22.719
You know what the Bible tells us, notice in verse 18,

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:24.939
the Bible says, then I told them of the hand of my God,

00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:27.619
which was good upon me, as also the king's words

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:28.899
that he had spoken unto me.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:31.059
And they said, notice what they said,

00:21:31.059 --> 00:21:33.879
let us rise up and build.

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:38.879
So they strengthened their hands for this good work.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.899
We find that there's opposition that comes

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:44.779
and the attack comes.

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:47.459
In chapter four, as we kind of fast forward

00:21:47.459 --> 00:21:48.659
and look at this example,

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:50.659
considering the example of hard work,

00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:52.659
we come to verse number six and the Bible says,

00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:55.819
so built we the wall, and all the wall was joined together

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:57.099
into the half thereof.

00:21:57.099 --> 00:22:02.099
Notice this phrase, for the people had a mind to work.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.439
The people had a mind to work.

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:08.779
The Bible tells us that they were working

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:12.779
with one hand holding a sword, a weapon,

00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:16.199
and one hand holding and doing some work over here, why?

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:18.299
Because the enemy, because the opposition.

00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:22.079
And you think about the intensity of the work,

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:24.799
you think about what they were exerting,

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.959
the energy, the focus.

00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:28.699
Listen, they weren't doing it for themselves,

00:22:28.699 --> 00:22:30.719
they were doing it for God.

00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:31.919
That God would be glorified.

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:34.119
By the way, God was helping them,

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:37.499
God was blessing them, God was giving them the strength

00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:38.719
to be able to do the work.

00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:41.799
Notice with me still here in chapter number four,

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.159
as we consider the example of hard work,

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:46.439
we're also reminded that the enemy,

00:22:46.439 --> 00:22:48.779
listen, someone always gonna try to stop you.

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:53.539
I was in a restaurant up in Pennsylvania

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:55.299
on Wednesday morning before I came home

00:22:55.299 --> 00:22:57.659
for the Beacon Conference, a group of preachers

00:22:57.659 --> 00:22:59.099
and several of their wives went out

00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:01.059
and had breakfast together before everyone

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:02.779
went their own way, and as we were there,

00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:04.859
we walked in and on the sign,

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:07.299
there were actually signs all over the building,

00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:09.579
it was a place run by Mennonites,

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:11.979
and they had some really good sayings in there,

00:23:11.979 --> 00:23:14.579
little signs, and it said whenever you try

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:17.779
to accomplish a good work, be sure there will be people

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:20.219
that tell you it can't work.

00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:22.579
And man, that one just caught my attention,

00:23:22.579 --> 00:23:24.219
a group of preachers, and we looked at that,

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:26.539
and we had a lot of comments to say about that

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:29.499
because there are people that are just doubters sometimes.

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:32.859
The enemy doesn't want us to do the work.

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:34.579
In verse number 11 of chapter four,

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:37.139
the Bible says this, and our adversary said,

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:38.859
they shall not know, neither see,

00:23:38.859 --> 00:23:41.119
till we come in the midst among them and slay them.

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:46.119
Notice what the Bible says, and cause the work to what?

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:49.879
To cease, not just to slow down, they're not,

00:23:49.879 --> 00:23:51.559
listen, the enemy doesn't want the work

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:55.879
to just kinda slow down, the enemy wants the work to cease.

00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:59.079
I shared that testimony or that prayer request this morning

00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:02.479
from the dear brother and his family down in Panama,

00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:04.259
his wife and his two little boys,

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:05.919
and those little boys are young boys,

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:09.439
and there's a matter of fear that's welled up

00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:11.419
in the hearts of those little boys, why?

00:24:11.419 --> 00:24:12.839
Because our house has been robbed,

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:14.499
and what happens if they come back?

00:24:14.499 --> 00:24:17.499
Listen, the enemy doesn't want that church to even start.

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:20.099
He wants to get them to give up

00:24:20.099 --> 00:24:23.299
before they even have their first service.

00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:25.539
But I'm thankful for a man, young man,

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:29.059
I don't know how old he is, he's younger than me,

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:30.779
he's a young man, a really young man

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:31.899
if he's younger than me, amen,

00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:33.579
because I'm still a young man,

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:38.299
and the reality is that, he said, God is good,

00:24:39.139 --> 00:24:42.219
God's gonna take care of it, we're not gonna give up,

00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:43.459
we're not gonna throw in the towel,

00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:45.939
we're not gonna go back and say, well, I guess,

00:24:45.939 --> 00:24:48.699
no, no, no, we're gonna just keep on plugging along, why?

00:24:48.699 --> 00:24:49.899
Because this work that we're doing

00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:53.339
is a good work for God, it's for God.

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:56.139
And we find here that the enemy,

00:24:56.139 --> 00:24:58.179
he's always gonna try to stop.

00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:01.659
It says that they would cause the work to cease.

00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:03.819
But you continue to read through the book of Nehemiah,

00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:05.739
you find, again, as I mentioned

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:07.739
throughout the end of the chapter, the fourth chapter,

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.419
how that verse 17, it says,

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:10.739
it says, they which build in the wall,

00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:13.939
and they that bear burdens with those that laid it,

00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:16.339
every one with one of his hands wrought in the work,

00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:18.219
and with the other hand held a weapon.

00:25:18.219 --> 00:25:19.539
And it says that the builders,

00:25:19.539 --> 00:25:21.699
every one had a sword girded by his sides,

00:25:21.699 --> 00:25:26.339
and so built, listen, they were working, they were laboring.

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:28.059
What an example that God gives us

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:31.299
in the book of Nehemiah of hard work.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:35.179
We come back to our text in 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:37.999
we find that the Bible uses that example,

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:39.839
as we've mentioned already in verse number six,

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:43.279
the husbandmen that laboreth.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.559
You know, that word laboreth is an interesting word,

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:48.279
and we, obviously, I believe we can gather

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:49.779
the understanding of the word

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:52.319
even in our own minds this morning,

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:54.799
but there are times in which a definition of a word

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:59.079
helps us to really understand the depth of the word.

00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:00.999
And that definition of the word laboreth,

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:04.839
it means to labor with wearisome effort.

00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:06.839
It literally carries with it the idea

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:10.439
of growing weary or exhausted.

00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:13.399
Have you ever worked when you couldn't work anymore?

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:14.239
You know what I mean?

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.759
I mean, you've worked so hard, you've labored so hard,

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:20.519
you put all in, and you just couldn't work anymore.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:22.359
You just had to go and get some rest

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:24.199
so that you could then maybe get up the next day

00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:25.719
and do it all over again.

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:31.039
We find here that it says the husbandmen that laboreth.

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.839
I've never been a farmer.

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:38.879
I've never, I've spent one little afternoon on a dairy farm

00:26:38.879 --> 00:26:40.999
when I was preaching in a church up in New York

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.799
right after Holly and I got married

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:45.039
and just filling the pulpit for a church

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.559
that didn't have a pastor.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.399
And that fella that invited us,

00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:50.679
he and his family invited us to their house for lunch,

00:26:50.679 --> 00:26:52.159
and after lunch, he said,

00:26:52.159 --> 00:26:54.359
well, it's time to go get the cows.

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.359
He said, do you wanna come?

00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:56.879
And I said, well, I have nothing but a suit.

00:26:56.879 --> 00:26:58.139
He said, well, we're about the same size.

00:26:58.139 --> 00:26:59.079
I'll get some clothes for you.

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:01.199
I said, all right, let's go.

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:02.959
That was work.

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:04.759
You know, some cows are hardheaded.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:06.879
And then one of them cows,

00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:08.399
I was trying to get its attention, Armando,

00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:10.759
it was like kinda looking at me like, I can take you out.

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.079
And I thought, you can, amen.

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:14.719
You're a lot bigger than I am.

00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:15.879
But it was work.

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:18.239
But you know what I find out about those in dairy farmers,

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:20.199
but not just dairy farmers, those that are crop farmers,

00:27:20.199 --> 00:27:21.599
you know what they do?

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:22.499
They work hard.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.519
They work hard.

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:28.719
We go and we pick up the milk at the store.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:32.519
And you say, some people,

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:33.879
I ain't gonna point anybody out,

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:35.839
but some people actually get somebody else

00:27:35.839 --> 00:27:38.159
to go pick it up for you and bring it, amen.

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.439
And you do that, you know, call ahead

00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:42.759
and you just pull into the spot and say, here I am.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:44.759
And they bring it all out.

00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:46.179
I like to go shopping myself,

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:49.119
but I don't like to go milk the cows myself.

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:52.519
But we understand it's labor.

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:54.679
Listen, I remember going to church

00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:56.319
with a fella in Pennsylvania

00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:58.639
that had a farm over in Delaware.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:02.639
And he was talking to me about just the daily life

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:04.439
of being a farmer and what he did

00:28:04.439 --> 00:28:08.199
in the many hundreds of acres of land that he farmed.

00:28:08.199 --> 00:28:09.439
And he talked to me about, listen,

00:28:09.439 --> 00:28:12.479
there's a time that you gotta get the seed in the ground,

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:14.119
the sowing time.

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:15.639
Listen, it doesn't matter if you feel tired,

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:18.719
it doesn't matter, there's a window of opportunity

00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:20.039
and you gotta get it in.

00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:21.799
And then guess what?

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.719
When it's harvest time, when it's time to reap,

00:28:23.719 --> 00:28:25.239
it can't be a, well, you know,

00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:26.679
I just don't feel like it today.

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:28.439
You know, I think I'm just gonna work for, no, no.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:31.439
You gotta get it in or you're gonna lose the crop.

00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:36.599
And here the Bible says the husbandmen that laboreth.

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:41.599
Listen, these people, Timothy, no doubt, Paul, no doubt,

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:46.139
the people in Ephesus that Paul is writing to Timothy

00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:48.519
as the pastor there in that first century

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.000
and obviously for a long time of individuals

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.799
reading this portion of scripture,

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:56.279
they knew what it was for a husbandman to labor.

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:02.279
Today, many of us have never been on a farm to work.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:09.039
They've gone and seen a farm, not worked a farm.

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.440
And here are the example of a good soldier

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.880
as it's illustrated through the text of scripture.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.399
He uses in verse five of that athlete

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:18.159
that's competing in the Isthmian games

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:21.479
and then in verse six, the husbandman that's laboring.

00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:25.919
The athlete in verse five that's working

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:28.260
and competing in those Isthmian games,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.399
he's gotta be disciplined if he wants to win,

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:34.399
if he wants to be crowned, he has to follow the rules.

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:37.199
He has to compete according to the rules

00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:39.599
that have been set forth, the guidelines he must,

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:42.139
it says, strive lawfully.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.760
But the husbandmen that laboreth, it's work.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.559
We gotta work for the Lord.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:52.119
In verse 24 of 2 Timothy,

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:55.159
I believe that I begin to see the labor in ministry.

00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:58.399
Remember, if you will, that Paul is writing to Timothy,

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.320
his son in the faith.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.959
This is not an epistle.

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:03.099
It's written to a church broadly,

00:30:03.099 --> 00:30:04.859
to a church in a particular location.

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:06.379
It's written to the pastor, Timothy,

00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:08.499
who is the pastor of the church at Ephesus,

00:30:08.499 --> 00:30:10.059
and obviously there's much going on,

00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:11.799
but I want you to see, if you will,

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:13.319
in verses 24 through 26,

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:16.559
the way that this thought of being a hard worker

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.939
in laboring is illustrated

00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:20.939
with regard to laboring in ministry.

00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:21.779
It says in verse 24,

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:25.159
and the servant of the Lord must not strive,

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:30.159
but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach patient.

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:32.559
Notice in verse 25,

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:37.559
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.839
That's kind of an interesting phrase

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.939
that God gives us there in verse number 25

00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:44.359
with regard to having that meekness

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:46.779
to instruct those that oppose themselves.

00:30:46.779 --> 00:30:48.599
Listen, it's one thing to instruct people

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:50.159
that want to be instructed.

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:53.759
It's one thing to have somebody come and say,

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:54.879
hey, I want you to teach me.

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:57.119
I had somebody that came to me recently and said,

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:59.879
hey, I'd like for you to give me some instruction,

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:03.399
some pointer, some help on my personal walk with God

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:04.499
and my daily devotions.

00:31:04.499 --> 00:31:05.559
Man, that's exciting.

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.439
That's good times.

00:31:06.439 --> 00:31:09.159
But he says, in meekness instructing those

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:10.439
that oppose themselves.

00:31:10.439 --> 00:31:11.959
He said in verse number 24

00:31:11.959 --> 00:31:14.199
that we're to be apt to teach patient.

00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:15.699
It says, continuing in verse 25,

00:31:15.699 --> 00:31:17.799
if God peradventure will give them repentance

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:20.879
to the acknowledging of the truth.

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.319
Now, I love that because it says

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:23.639
that give them repentance

00:31:23.639 --> 00:31:25.579
to the acknowledging of the truth.

00:31:25.579 --> 00:31:29.039
Listen, it's about giving the truth.

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:32.559
It's not about changing the message to appeal to them,

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.999
to appease them, to coddle them.

00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:37.239
No, it's that they might come

00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:40.319
to the acceptance of the truth.

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:42.639
That's important for us to understand this morning.

00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:46.679
A lot of places that have changed the message

00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:50.359
because the message hasn't been received by the masses

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:52.439
and that becomes problematic

00:31:52.439 --> 00:31:54.719
because God has delivered to us a message

00:31:54.719 --> 00:31:57.519
that we ought to teach, that we're instructed to teach,

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.479
and I'm thankful that his word is truth.

00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:02.479
Notice in verse 26, they may recover themselves

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:03.439
out of the snare of the devil

00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:06.119
who are taken captive by him at his will.

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:09.279
Listen, there's spiritual battle that's taking place.

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:10.459
There's spiritual battle.

00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:13.999
The work of the husbandman is illustrated

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:16.999
in verse number six is a hard work.

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:19.079
It's a wearisome work.

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:21.119
It's a exhausting work,

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:24.439
but the good soldier, the servant of the Lord

00:32:24.439 --> 00:32:26.799
as it's referred to in verse number 24

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:29.859
is one that is laboring, that is working.

00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:31.959
Listen, the reality this morning

00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:35.319
is that we are giving the instruction as pastors,

00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:36.959
as a spiritual leader,

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:39.519
giving the instruction to feed the flock of God,

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:43.599
to labor in the word and in prayer.

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:47.059
It's work, it's work,

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:48.999
and it's not something that you just take lightly.

00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:51.679
Listen, God's given all of us a work to do.

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:52.999
He's given us a responsibility.

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:54.879
I think about even in this text of Scripture

00:32:54.879 --> 00:32:56.959
in 2 Timothy 2 in verse 15,

00:32:56.959 --> 00:32:59.799
the verse that's our memory verse for the month of October.

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:02.119
Study to show thyself approved unto God,

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:04.199
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:05.759
rightly dividing the word of truth.

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:07.279
Listen, study.

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.919
If you know what, if you think about the word study,

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:12.639
it carries with the idea of work.

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:15.359
Studying is work, it's labor.

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:18.839
So we find that there's an exhortation,

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:21.639
there's an example, but notice with me number three.

00:33:22.639 --> 00:33:27.559
Consider with me the expectation of those who work hard,

00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:30.479
the expectation of those that work hard.

00:33:30.479 --> 00:33:32.599
In our text of Scripture in verse number six,

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:34.919
the Bible says the husbandman that laboreth,

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:36.519
and then notice this phrase,

00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:39.239
must be first partaker of what?

00:33:39.239 --> 00:33:40.759
The fruits.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:43.519
You know, there's the expectation that the husbandman has.

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.359
The husbandman works hard,

00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:47.679
but the expectation that there's gonna be fruit,

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:49.239
there's gonna be a reward,

00:33:49.239 --> 00:33:51.239
if I could use that terminology this morning.

00:33:51.879 --> 00:33:53.319
There's going to be something

00:33:53.319 --> 00:33:56.679
that's going to be the result of his effort.

00:33:56.679 --> 00:34:00.199
And we find here this morning as we consider

00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:02.759
the expectation of those who work hard

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:05.839
and consider this idea of being a partaker of the fruits

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:07.319
as it says there in verse number six

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.359
that he must be first partaker of the fruits.

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.759
And you think about that husbandman that's laboring,

00:34:11.759 --> 00:34:14.639
and when the harvest comes in, when the crop is ready,

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:18.599
that man, they're being rewarded for their hard work.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.959
What a joy it is.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.599
Brother Armando tells me about the mango trees

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:25.599
and all the other things that he has down there

00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:27.479
in Guatemala, and he tells me about,

00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:29.879
man, grabbing one of those mangoes right off the tree

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:33.279
and just, it's not like what you buy here.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.479
Listen, I had some pineapple when I was in Panama.

00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:39.439
I've never tasted pineapple like that before.

00:34:39.439 --> 00:34:41.199
You said, I'm being honest with you,

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.959
it was like nothing I'd ever tasted before.

00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:45.239
It was the bananas.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.759
I said, man, I need one of those bananas.

00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:47.599
Why?

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:48.439
Because it just looked,

00:34:48.439 --> 00:34:50.279
you ever go to the Walmart or the Giant

00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:52.439
or wherever you shop, and they're green as green can be,

00:34:52.439 --> 00:34:54.639
and they're like, and then they go from green to brown.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.159
Like, what happened to the yellow stage, amen?

00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:58.199
You know what I'm saying?

00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:00.319
Man, these bananas, Armando, do they not look good?

00:35:00.319 --> 00:35:01.919
I mean, it is amazing.

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:06.919
But you know, when we're working hard

00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:11.919
and we're working for the master, we have an expectation.

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:13.519
Here's the amazing thing.

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:16.199
We may not always see the results,

00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:19.039
but we can always rejoice in knowing that God is working.

00:35:19.919 --> 00:35:23.279
I think about some individuals that plant things.

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:25.039
We've had a garden for a few years,

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:27.319
and over the years, you plant gardens,

00:35:27.319 --> 00:35:29.199
you have an opportunity with a vegetable garden

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:31.039
that you're gonna plant the garden,

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.319
you're gonna have some fruit,

00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:33.839
you're gonna yield some increase

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:35.879
at some point down the road.

00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:37.479
But you know, there's some fruit trees.

00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:39.759
I read and understand that some of those fruit trees

00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:42.959
take up to seven years to produce some fruit.

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:43.999
You think about those fruit trees.

00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:47.079
Listen, it's possible that someone plants a fruit tree

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:50.599
and never actually partakes of the fruit.

00:35:51.759 --> 00:35:52.599
But you know what?

00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:54.199
Someone else will be able to.

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:55.799
Someone else will be able to.

00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:58.479
And that's an amazing truth, an amazing understanding.

00:35:58.479 --> 00:36:01.959
I think about David, even as he prepared for the temple.

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:04.439
You know that David worked hard preparing for the temple.

00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:06.479
He spent those last days of his life, I mean,

00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:09.519
really laboring and working hard to build for the temple.

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:12.319
Listen, God had put it in David's heart to build a temple.

00:36:12.319 --> 00:36:13.999
And in fact, Nathan immediately said,

00:36:13.999 --> 00:36:15.599
do all that's in your heart.

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:18.159
And then God appeared to him that same night and said,

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:20.559
no, David is not the one that's to build the temple.

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:23.799
But we find that as David obeyed the Lord

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:25.599
and understand that he was not permitted

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:28.519
to build the temple, it was still in his heart.

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:31.199
He desired to build a house for the Lord.

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:32.599
He lived in a nice place.

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:33.679
He lived in his own palace.

00:36:33.679 --> 00:36:35.599
He's looking around and says, God deserves.

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:38.039
And he wanted to do this work for God.

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:39.679
And God said, no, it's not for you to do,

00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:40.799
but for your son Solomon.

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:41.679
You know what David did?

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:44.199
He prepared, he worked hard, he labored

00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:46.279
so that everything was in place

00:36:46.279 --> 00:36:48.999
for a generation that would follow him.

00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:50.999
He labored and he worked hard

00:36:50.999 --> 00:36:53.359
and he gave of his own resources

00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:55.599
so that a temple could be built

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:59.879
that he himself would never personally worship God in.

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:03.999
But he saw beyond his ears.

00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:05.879
He saw he was gonna work for God.

00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:08.819
And God's work carries on.

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:11.519
God's work is bigger than any one of us individually.

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:14.159
God's work is bigger than my life, than your life,

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:15.839
than the years of our life.

00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:17.319
God's work marches on.

00:37:17.319 --> 00:37:18.679
God's work continues.

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:21.559
And we see that as we understand the expectation

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:23.199
of those that work hard, consider with me,

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:25.639
1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 10,

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:27.559
what the Bible says about here

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:29.519
with regard to the one that's laboring,

00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:31.639
the one that's working.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:33.239
In 1 Corinthians 9,

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:36.999
choosing the example of the one that plows

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:38.559
and it says in verse 10,

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:41.079
1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 10,

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:47.239
or saith he altogether for our sakes,

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:49.479
for our sakes no doubt this is written,

00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:53.199
that he that ploweth should plow in what?

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:54.039
Hope.

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:58.159
That he that thresheth in hope

00:37:58.159 --> 00:38:00.999
should be partaker of his hope.

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:04.559
Now remember, the Bible word hope

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:07.999
is not like we sometimes use the word hope today.

00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:10.739
Sometimes we use the word hope as I hope this happens

00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:13.479
and it's just kind of this wishful thinking kind of an idea.

00:38:13.519 --> 00:38:15.879
But the word hope biblically has with it,

00:38:15.879 --> 00:38:19.759
it carries with it a confident expectation.

00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:22.439
We talk about the blessed hope,

00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:24.799
the fact that Jesus is going to return.

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:26.479
That's not something that I'm just wishing

00:38:26.479 --> 00:38:27.519
that Jesus is gonna come back.

00:38:27.519 --> 00:38:29.599
No, I have a confident expectation

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:31.919
that my Jesus is coming back.

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:32.759
Amen.

00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:35.279
I'd be okay if it'd be today, this week, amen.

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.919
Praise the Lord, even so come Lord Jesus, amen.

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:43.439
And he says he that ploweth, he ploweth in hope.

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:47.839
It says here that he that thresheth in hope

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.519
shall be partaker of his hope.

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:52.579
And we see that expectation of hard work.

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:55.019
We find in 1 Corinthians as we make the analogy

00:38:55.019 --> 00:38:57.199
and cross over to our work for the Lord

00:38:57.199 --> 00:38:59.239
and understanding the principles

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:01.239
that God has given us in his word

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.959
and now beginning to look at the work

00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:04.319
that we're doing for God.

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:07.079
In 1 Corinthians 15, it's a great chapter

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:08.959
dealing with the resurrection

00:39:08.959 --> 00:39:10.639
and what a great chapter it is.

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:12.919
But in verse number 58, as he comes to the end

00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:15.359
of all of this with regard to the resurrection

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:18.239
that this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:20.839
that this corruption shall put on incorruption,

00:39:20.839 --> 00:39:22.239
that we labor for the Lord.

00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:24.359
He says, therefore, in verse 58,

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:27.799
my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable,

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:29.759
always abounding in what?

00:39:29.759 --> 00:39:31.399
In the work of the Lord.

00:39:31.399 --> 00:39:32.799
Why?

00:39:32.799 --> 00:39:36.639
For as much as ye notice this phrase, as ye know.

00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:42.479
For as much as ye know that your labor

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:47.919
is not in vain in the Lord.

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:49.339
Isn't that a great truth?

00:39:49.339 --> 00:39:52.639
So often we can rush over those little words,

00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:54.999
we know, ye know.

00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:57.719
Listen, God wants us to have the understanding

00:39:57.719 --> 00:39:59.639
that the work that we're doing for him

00:39:59.639 --> 00:40:01.359
is not a work that's in vain.

00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:07.599
vain. We do a work for Him. Listen, I was talking to Ronnie last week. I didn't go

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:10.999
door-knocking with Ronnie yesterday. I went with Tim, but last week Ronnie and I

00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:14.559
went and we did some follow-up visits for some folks that have visited the church

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:18.479
and were out, and Ronnie and I were kind of striking out. I mean, people weren't

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:22.279
home, and I said, man, Ronnie, I'm sorry, like, no one's home and no one to talk to.

00:40:22.279 --> 00:40:24.999
And you know what Ronnie said to me? It was an encouragement. He said, you know,

00:40:24.999 --> 00:40:29.159
Pastor, he said, it's not about the results. It's about the work that we're

00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:33.559
doing for God. And it was a good reminder for me. He said, you need a reminder

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:39.879
sometimes? Yeah, and so do you. Amen? Listen, we don't always see the results,

00:40:39.879 --> 00:40:46.039
but we can be confident knowing that God is always working. Testimonies of people

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:50.039
over the years that have been prayed for, that have been sought to be ministered

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:54.839
to, that took years and years and years for them to respond to the call of God,

00:40:54.839 --> 00:41:03.959
to the sweet call of, come unto me. Just keep laboring. Why? Because our labor is

00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:10.079
not in vain in the Lord, and we work hard for the Lord. He's a good soldier.

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:15.919
A good soldier works hard. Galatians 6, the book of Galatians in the sixth

00:41:15.919 --> 00:41:25.479
chapter, we read a great truth in verse number 7 that we often use in the

00:41:25.479 --> 00:41:30.519
negative, but not so much in the positive. But the reality is that the text of

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:33.759
Scripture, if you read verse 8 and 9, it deals with both the negative and the

00:41:33.759 --> 00:41:36.639
positive. And here's the truth that we deal with in verse 7.

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:40.479
Be not deceived. God does not mock whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:47.279
reap. Sowing and reaping, the principle that God has set forth, and oftentimes

00:41:47.279 --> 00:41:53.519
that principle is used to talk about negative sowing, and you're going to reap.

00:41:53.519 --> 00:41:56.479
We understand that, and it's certainly applicable, and it's important we see in

00:41:56.479 --> 00:41:59.799
verse 8, but I want you to notice in verse 8, for he that soweth to his flesh

00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:04.159
shall of the flesh reap corruption. Now that's the negative side of it. Amen?

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:10.279
The preacher of yesteryear said someone's out all week sowing seeds of rebellion

00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:13.999
and sowing bad seeds, and then he comes to church on Sunday and he prays for

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:18.679
crop failure. And I thought that was kind of comical to think about the way that

00:42:18.679 --> 00:42:23.759
they use that terminology. Listen, what you sow you're going to reap. But verse

00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:29.239
number 8 continues and says this, but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the

00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:36.479
Spirit reap life everlasting, and let us not be weary in well-doing. I don't know

00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:42.959
about you, but sometimes if we're not careful, we can grow weary. So we're

00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:45.199
talking about the work of the Lord. You're not seeing the results. You're

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:52.999
not seeing the...you can grow weary. Grow weary. But he says this, and let us not be

00:42:52.999 --> 00:43:01.919
weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. God wants us

00:43:01.919 --> 00:43:08.279
to work till we can work no more. He wants us to work till we can work. Some

00:43:08.279 --> 00:43:13.199
might say, well, I can't work like I used to. But you can still work. I don't have

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:18.399
as much energy as I used to have. That's okay. Use what energy you have. Right? We

00:43:18.399 --> 00:43:26.359
work till we can work no more. When my life work is ended, is that not what the

00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:32.999
songwriter said? Listen, God has a work for us to do. And we need to work hard for our

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:39.799
Master. A good soldier works hard. We notice in our text of Scripture, just as there's

00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:45.799
an expectation of the husbandman that he's going to be a partaker of the fruits, that

00:43:45.799 --> 00:43:51.399
there ought to be an expectation of us as the people of God, that as we work for our

00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:57.719
Master, that our Master sees our work and that He will reward us accordingly. He sees

00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:03.759
our work. Our work is not in vain in the Lord. And He'll reward us. You may not see the

00:44:03.759 --> 00:44:10.639
reward. You may not see the fruit today. But I think we're going to see some people in

00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:16.839
heaven one day. We're going to see some people in heaven one day that are the fruit of our

00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:23.479
labor, that we never get the opportunity to meet them here. We shared a gospel witness

00:44:23.479 --> 00:44:27.639
with them. We shared a tract with them. Maybe we put a gospel tract or a book of Romans

00:44:27.639 --> 00:44:31.519
together that went to the other side of the world. Maybe we paid for a Bible that was

00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:39.519
printed and sent to a school somewhere in Papua New Guinea or a Bible that we paid for

00:44:39.519 --> 00:44:44.839
to be sent and put into a home of somebody in Samoa that we'll never meet. But we're

00:44:44.839 --> 00:44:50.159
laboring. We're working. We're going to do some work this week on Thursday and Friday.

00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:53.959
You say, why don't we do a scripture assembly? Can't they find machines to do that? Yeah,

00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:58.359
they can actually. A lot of machines that do that stuff. But you know, it's something

00:44:58.359 --> 00:45:06.239
precious to me about being able to sit down and put my hands to work, to tear apart scripture,

00:45:06.239 --> 00:45:10.639
to put it together. I don't say, those of you that know, we're not tearing it apart

00:45:10.639 --> 00:45:16.199
like destroying it. It comes off the printing press and the signature has to be torn and

00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:23.239
stuffed in. And it's work. And if you sit at that table for a few hours and you're working,

00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:27.079
you get up and your shoulders might hurt a little bit. But listen, I'm thankful that

00:45:27.079 --> 00:45:32.519
my shoulders hurt a little bit because I was doing some work for God. And if there's somebody

00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:37.319
that's going to get a gospel witness that maybe has never heard the truth that God loves

00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:46.719
them, our labor is not in vain. Let me remind you this morning, in Revelation 2 and 3, we

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:54.079
read of seven churches. Those seven churches are, I believe, and we'll start a series in

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:59.599
the book of Revelation here next Sunday evening, actually. And I believe, and we'll get there

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:04.319
in short order as we begin seeing those seven churches in the beginning of chapter two.

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:08.079
The church at Ephesus is actually the first church that's mentioned. I believe that all

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:14.199
those churches are real, literal churches that existed at the time of the writing. But

00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:20.679
I also believe that those churches are really pictures of the church age. I believe that

00:46:20.679 --> 00:46:25.639
those churches are helping us understand that throughout the church age that every church

00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:31.599
is going to have some aspect of resemblance to one of these churches, maybe a mix of some

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:35.679
of these churches. I do not believe, some people would teach and they believe that we're

00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:41.000
living the seventh church, the church of the Laodiceans, that we're living in the Laodicean

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.559
church age, and therefore every church has to be like the church of Laodicea. I don't

00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:50.599
believe that. If I did, I'd go do something else. I'm just being honest with you. Because

00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:54.159
the church of Laodicean was a church that was full of everything. They didn't need anything.

00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:58.959
They didn't even need God. God was on the outside of their church knocking because He

00:46:58.959 --> 00:47:04.479
wanted to have fellowship with them. But I want to remind you of something of those

00:47:04.479 --> 00:47:11.519
seven churches, and I gave all of that information to make the full application. God says to

00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:22.039
every one of those churches, I know thy works. The message to every church is not the same.

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:25.839
If you read all of those in chapter 2 and 3, those seven churches, the message to each

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:33.079
of them is not the same. But one consistent truth that's given to every one of those

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:40.039
churches is, I know thy works. I would submit to you this morning that God knew the works

00:47:40.039 --> 00:47:44.959
of those literal churches, but God knows the work of every church throughout the church

00:47:44.959 --> 00:47:50.559
age. It's as if He could say this morning, and I do not think it would be a stretch at

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:59.879
all to say, Fellowship Baptist Church, I know thy works. Can I tell you this morning

00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:04.759
that that ought to bring to each of us a mix of emotions. It ought to cause us to rejoice

00:48:04.759 --> 00:48:09.879
that God knows what we're doing for Him, but it ought to cause us to really examine and

00:48:09.879 --> 00:48:16.119
evaluate, how's my work for God? Is God pleased with my work? Does God see my work as a work

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:26.559
that is just all in? I mean, I'm working hard for the Lord. I believe that as God's people,

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:33.079
we should strive for excellence. Can I say this? Our God is worthy of our full effort.

00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:38.719
He's worthy of it. We ought to strive for excellence as the people of God. It ought

00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:42.839
to be, I worked in this corporate world for years. I had the privilege of working in the

00:48:42.839 --> 00:48:51.079
corporate world for years. The last company that I worked for was Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation.

00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:55.399
And as I examined my life at that point, as I would examine my life today, my work for

00:48:55.399 --> 00:49:04.159
Sikorsky should never have been more than my work for God. He's worthy of my effort.

00:49:04.159 --> 00:49:09.839
I shouldn't work harder for my employer than I work for my Savior. I understand the hours

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:16.159
may be different, but I'm saying I ought to work hard for my God. I ought to work hard

00:49:16.159 --> 00:49:21.000
for my God. He's worthy of it. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.659
us. We thank you for the privilege of knowing you. We've considered these five characteristics

00:49:25.659 --> 00:49:32.159
over these last weeks. What does it mean to be a good soldier? Today we finish this thought,

00:49:32.159 --> 00:49:39.279
this series, mini-series, if you will, with a charge to work hard. Lord, I thank you

00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:45.159
for those that are laboring together with you here in our church. And I pray, God, that

00:49:45.159 --> 00:49:48.919
you'd help each one of us as individuals, even as we started the service by singing

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:54.880
that song, Is Your All, on the altar, that we would individually examine our work for

00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:00.760
you. How are we doing? Are we laboring? Are we working for the Master?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:06.600
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to follow the exhortation, Lord, that we'd see the example

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:15.200
and follow that example, that we would have the expectation of the rewards, the fruits

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200
of our labor.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.360
Would you move and work as only you can through this time of invitation, we'll thank you for

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.160
all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
