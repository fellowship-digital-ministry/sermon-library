1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
number three this evening, Psalm 3.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,360
And last week we started a four-part series from Psalm 3.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,659
And I mentioned to you that there are eight verses

4
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,319
in this particular psalm,

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:14,600
and really four divisions, two verses each.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,559
And so last week we looked at verses one and two.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,600
And as we examined the first two verses of Psalm 3,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,139
we saw the reality of the situation that David faced.

9
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,719
You'll remember that this psalm,

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,100
if you think about the background of this psalm

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,719
and the setting for this psalm,

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,659
was during the time of Absalom's rebellion and his revolt.

13
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,779
And as we begin to notice and look back

14
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:41,299
at 2 Samuel 15 and 16,

15
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,020
and look through those chapters that record for us

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,240
the event that David is going through,

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,099
we will find that as we look at this text of scripture,

18
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:56,040
this is not an exaggeration on the part of David.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,099
This is not some type of an assumption

20
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,340
on the part of David.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,979
We find that this is reality.

22
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,279
This is what he was facing.

23
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,940
This is what he was dealing with.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,580
We find that it was in verse number one

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,860
that he says, they are increased that trouble me.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,500
They are increased that trouble me.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,260
He says again in verse number one,

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,139
we used it as the title of the message last week,

29
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:23,680
many are they that rise up against me.

30
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:26,580
And so they've increased those that trouble me.

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,019
There are many that rise up against me.

32
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:31,779
We find that he said this in verse number two,

33
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:34,220
that they were saying of David,

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,139
there is no help for him in God.

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,019
God's not even gonna be able to help him in this situation.

36
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:45,059
I'm thankful that our God is a very present help

37
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:46,940
in the time of trouble, amen.

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,739
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us,

39
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,459
lift up our eyes into the hills

40
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,739
from whence cometh our help.

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Our help cometh from the Lord,

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,199
which made heaven and earth.

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,160
And not only is he able to help,

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
but he is available to help.

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,480
And I'm so thankful for the truth of God's word

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,379
with regard to that statement,

47
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,820
that reality of the help that God provides.

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,779
As we think about the truth of this passage of scripture

49
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,279
being a reality, not an exaggeration,

50
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,800
not a possibility that they're going to rise against me,

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,399
but a reality, it was told to us in 2 Samuel 15,

52
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,720
and verse number 12,

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,399
and the conspiracy was strong

54
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,399
for the people increased continually with Absalom.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
We find that this was the situation

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,919
in which David was facing,

57
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,380
and it was a real situation.

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,440
The reality is painted, is provided to us

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,979
in verses one and two.

60
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,240
This evening, as we examine and continue

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,559
through the portion of scripture,

62
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,479
we'll look at verses three and four,

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,839
and really we'll consider tonight the response,

64
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,759
David's response to the situation.

65
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,160
We see the reality last week,

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,820
but I mentioned even as we closed last Wednesday evening,

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,320
that certainly we face troubles, we face difficulties.

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,679
There are people that will oppose those of us

69
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,339
as we will stand for biblical truth.

70
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,080
We will face opposition.

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,880
There are many adversaries.

72
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,839
We understand that.

73
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,279
We read the word of God,

74
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,320
and we understand that every time

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,759
someone attempts to do something for God,

76
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,479
there's going to be opposition.

77
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,479
There's going to be adversity.

78
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,779
But how do we respond to that opposition?

79
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:33,479
How is it that we respond to the adversity that we face?

80
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,080
How is it that we respond to those that would trouble us,

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,119
those that would speak ill of us?

82
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,080
What is it that we do?

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,779
How is it that we respond?

84
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,979
And tonight, we'll deal with the response

85
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,020
of David to this situation.

86
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,919
I would say this, in a single word,

87
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,320
his response is one of prayer.

88
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,639
And that's a simple way of looking at verses three and four.

89
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,000
If you are taking notes and want a title

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
for the message this evening,

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,119
it would be from verse number four.

92
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,800
I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,160
I want you to notice in the response,

96
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,320
look at verse three and four, the Bible says,

97
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:20,399
but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

98
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,119
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

99
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:29,440
I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,440
and He heard me out of His holy hill, Sila.

101
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,640
As we look at these verses of Scripture

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,920
and consider the response of David to the situation,

103
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,459
I want you to notice, first of all,

104
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,859
that David rehearses who God is to him.

105
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:50,179
In this act of rehearsing, in verse number three,

106
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:53,739
as he rehearses, it's really a reminder to himself.

107
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:57,019
And oftentimes as we pray, we've often mentioned,

108
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,899
I've said, and I've encouraged,

109
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,940
and I've even revealed to you personally

110
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,179
how in my own prayer time,

111
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:08,179
how I begin my prayer time with a time of adoration,

112
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,380
praising God for who He is.

113
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,579
And also not only who He is

114
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,660
and His attributes and His character,

115
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,619
but really who He is to me.

116
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,220
And we begin to consider oftentimes

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,380
throughout the Scriptures,

118
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,100
we find that He is my advocate.

119
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,540
He is my shepherd.

120
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,299
He is my forerunner.

121
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,220
He is my great high priest.

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,739
We begin to think about these things,

123
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,820
and as we rehearse those things,

124
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,140
we're reminding ourselves of who God is to us.

125
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,179
I'm thankful that He's my Savior,

126
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:41,019
and I'm thankful that He is the Savior of the world,

127
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,179
but you think about the truth

128
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,579
that He's my Savior personally,

129
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,380
and David, we find in verse number three,

130
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,940
he says, but thou, O Lord, are a shield for me,

131
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,260
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

132
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,339
So we find that in verse number three,

133
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,380
we spoke that his response is one of prayer,

134
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,820
that he's praying.

135
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,179
We see that in verse number four,

136
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,779
he says, I cried unto the Lord.

137
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,859
But we notice in verse number three

138
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:09,019
as he speaks about who God is to him,

139
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,980
I want you to consider this evening

140
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,220
that as we respond to situations

141
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,220
such as what David was facing,

142
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,100
that which he was dealing with,

143
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,940
when we deal with adversity,

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,540
when we deal with opposition,

145
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,019
when we deal with trouble and trials,

146
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,179
when we respond in prayer,

147
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:31,980
when we respond by first rehearsing who God is to me,

148
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,220
when we recognize and remind ourselves

149
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,980
of who He is, it's encouraging.

150
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,179
It encourages us, it strengthens us,

151
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,859
and it helps us to shift our focus.

152
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:48,540
Sometimes what happens in the time of trial,

153
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,660
in the time of trouble, in the time of difficulty,

154
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,980
is that all we can focus upon is that trouble, right?

155
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,420
It just consumes us,

156
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,899
and we just are so focused upon the trouble and the trial

157
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,140
and the opposition and the adversity,

158
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,940
and it sucks all of our attention and all of our time,

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,220
and we're so focused on those things.

160
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,540
And when we begin to pray,

161
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,739
we begin to rehearse who God is to us,

162
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,980
it's a shift in focus.

163
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,660
No longer am I focusing on woe is me,

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,260
no longer am I focusing on my problem, my trouble, my trial,

165
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,779
but we find that here in Psalm 3,

166
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,940
as David understands the reality of the situation

167
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,059
in the first two verses,

168
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,100
his response is one of prayer,

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,820
and he begins that prayer by rehearsing who God is to him.

170
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,820
First of all, he says that He is a shield for me.

171
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,140
But thou, O Lord, verse number three,

172
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,820
art a shield for me.

173
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,940
Oftentimes throughout the book of Psalms,

174
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,700
we find that the Word of God teaches us

175
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,260
and reveals to us that our God is a shield and a buckler.

176
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,299
We find that this is the first reference

177
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:09,019
of God being a shield for me in the book of Psalms.

178
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,540
And we find that David, as he says,

179
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,100
as he makes this declaration,

180
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,579
as he rehearses who God is to him,

181
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,540
when he reminds himself that God, Jehovah, the Creator,

182
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
the King of kings, the Lord of lords,

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,500
that He is a shield for me.

184
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,299
Think about that.

185
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:32,059
I mean, he's dealing with great adversity.

186
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,900
Remember, those that were increased,

187
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,059
that were troubling him,

188
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,820
we find that he said there were many

189
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,419
that rise up against him.

190
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,539
It says that in verse number two,

191
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,940
that those enemies were saying of him

192
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,659
that there is no help for him in God.

193
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,940
And we find that David, he responds,

194
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
though the conspiracy was strong

195
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,700
and though the people increased continually with Absalom,

196
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,739
we find that he begins to remind himself

197
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,219
as he rehearses and he says,

198
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:04,340
Lord, Thou art a shield for me.

199
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,099
What does a shield do?

200
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,059
A shield provides defense.

201
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,979
A shield provides protection.

202
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,099
And we think about the imagery

203
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,700
and we think about the understanding

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,340
as David is praying and he's rehearsing

205
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,659
who God is to him,

206
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,659
he begins by saying, Lord, you're my shield.

207
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:32,619
Lord, you art a shield for me.

208
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,780
I love the fact that he says for me

209
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,219
because it's personal.

210
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,299
It's precious.

211
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,140
When you think about it in those terms,

212
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,340
often we've made the statement

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,219
as we've considered the 23rd Psalm,

214
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,859
the Lord is my shepherd

215
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,820
and all of the personal pronouns

216
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,179
that are used by the Psalmist

217
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,460
in that wonderful, familiar Psalm.

218
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,780
And we find that that brings great comfort to our hearts.

219
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,179
It encourages us and it strengthens us.

220
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,859
And here, as David is rehearsing who God is,

221
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,219
yes, he's dealing with great adversity,

222
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,719
with great opposition,

223
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,479
but he says,

224
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:14,119
"...but Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me."

225
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:18,439
They may say that there's no help for him in God,

226
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,399
but God, I know that You're my shield.

227
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,379
Isn't that precious?

228
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:27,099
And we see, do you notice how there's a shift in focus?

229
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,939
Do we notice how that, yes,

230
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,619
the reality of the situation is given to us in verses 1 and 2?

231
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,919
Indeed, this is not just an assumption.

232
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,919
This is not an exaggeration.

233
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,799
There was real trouble.

234
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,599
But instead of being consumed and focused upon just the trouble

235
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:48,159
and the many adversaries and all of the problems,

236
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,399
his attention, why?

237
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,739
Because he responded in prayer,

238
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,899
his attention, his focus is shifted not to his problem,

239
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,739
but to his God.

240
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,379
And how precious that is.

241
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,219
Someone said this,

242
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:07,099
we need to simply glance at our circumstances,

243
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,159
but we need to gaze at our Savior.

244
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,599
And I like that.

245
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,199
Because Hebrews 12 says,

246
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,499
"...looking unto Jesus,

247
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,259
the Author and Finisher of our faith."

248
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:23,739
So often, however, we find ourselves as we live this life,

249
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,579
when we go through difficulties and trials and troubles,

250
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,219
that we actually gaze upon our problems

251
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:35,599
and simply glance at our Savior.

252
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,319
And how it's not the way it ought to be.

253
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,399
We think of Peter.

254
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,599
Often times, we think of Peter when he walked on water.

255
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,999
What happened when he walked on the water?

256
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,339
Where was his attention fixed?

257
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,179
I don't know how many steps he took out of the boat,

258
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,519
but I find in my sanctified imagination

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,219
as I would look at that scene,

260
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:00,959
I find that Peter is zeroed in, he is gazing,

261
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,459
he is focused upon the Lord Jesus Christ,

262
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,359
and he says,

263
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:09,259
Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come to Thee.

264
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,799
And what does Jesus say?

265
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,359
Come.

266
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,839
And what does Peter do?

267
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,399
He walks.

268
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,099
Was the storm raging?

269
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,839
Were the waves tempestuous?

270
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,139
Was the wind boisterous?

271
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,879
Absolutely.

272
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,619
But he's focused upon Jesus.

273
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,719
And he walked on water.

274
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:29,219
And what happened to Peter?

275
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,079
His focus changed.

276
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,279
Right?

277
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,119
What do you look at?

278
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,819
Man, the wind, the waves,

279
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,099
the reality of what he was facing,

280
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,159
and he began to sink.

281
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,659
What's the Bible tell us?

282
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,500
He was wise.

283
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,099
He said, Lord, help.

284
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,639
And the Lord graciously brought him up.

285
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,039
And I believe with all my heart

286
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,199
that he walked on water back to the boat.

287
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,299
However far he got out of the ship,

288
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,679
he had to walk that far back with the Lord.

289
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,379
And we find that here,

290
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,000
as we note the response,

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,039
we find that David begins first

292
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,119
by rehearsing who God is to him.

293
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:05,959
That's why it's so important

294
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,959
that we know the Word of God.

295
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,599
And we know who He is to us.

296
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,439
And we understand this evening

297
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,500
that David begins by saying,

298
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,639
Thou art a shield for me.

299
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,000
The defense that I need, Lord, You provide.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,239
The protection that I so desperately need

301
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,719
in this situation, in this trial,

302
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,719
in this adversity that I'm facing,

303
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,899
Lord, You're the one that's going to provide that for me.

304
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,739
Notice he continues.

305
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:38,479
He says, My glory, my glory,

306
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,039
honor, glory.

307
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,779
Though David's circumstances had changed rapidly

308
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,619
and drastically,

309
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:47,119
I want you to consider the fact

310
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,119
that the Lord is constant.

311
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,399
He's consistent.

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,399
He never changes.

313
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,819
He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

314
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,399
Aren't you thankful for that?

315
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,919
We mentioned about the immutability of the Lord.

316
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,579
He never changes.

317
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,779
And though our circumstances change,

318
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,639
and though we can deal with adversity,

319
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,819
and we can have moments in life

320
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,579
that some have referred to as being

321
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,619
roller coaster type of events,

322
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:13,739
and we can see the ups and downs of life,

323
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:16,079
we find that our God remains constant.

324
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,220
And it's He that is our glory.

325
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,539
And we look to Him,

326
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,519
and we find that David is focused upon

327
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,220
the constant and the consistent nature of our God.

328
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,739
He says this at the end of verse number three,

329
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:35,220
and the lifter up of mine head.

330
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,019
What happens sometimes when we deal

331
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,220
with troubles and trials?

332
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,380
We get discouraged.

333
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,639
Do we not?

334
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,479
We're human.

335
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,220
God knows that we're but dust.

336
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,100
He formed us.

337
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,459
He made us.

338
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,299
Right?

339
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:48,119
He knows our frame.

340
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,639
He knows that we're but dust.

341
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,479
And we find that oftentimes as we deal with

342
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:56,380
opposition and adversity and troubles and trials in life,

343
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,919
that it is possible for us to get discouraged.

344
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,399
And one thing that happens when we get discouraged

345
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,079
is sometimes we have our head down.

346
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:03,959
Do we not?

347
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,479
We have our head down.

348
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,199
We're discouraged.

349
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,479
Sometimes you can just see in the countenance

350
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,720
of an individual,

351
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,539
you don't even know what they're dealing with.

352
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,979
You don't know what their life consists of,

353
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,100
but you can see in their countenance

354
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,979
that they're discouraged.

355
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:23,899
Right?

356
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:24,940
We've lived long enough.

357
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,959
We can see.

358
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,979
We can understand when someone's dealing with something.

359
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,419
We may not know what it is,

360
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:33,179
but we can tell when someone's discouraged.

361
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,859
And David, though again his circumstances

362
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:39,139
had changed rapidly and drastically,

363
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,859
and though there's the opportunity for discouragement

364
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,139
and disheartened and all those things,

365
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,739
we find that it is the Lord who sustains us.

366
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,019
He is the lifter up of mine head.

367
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,979
This is a different circumstance here in Psalm 3

368
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:01,799
that would result in the writing of this particular Psalm.

369
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,979
It's at the rebellion and revolt of Absalom,

370
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,820
but we find that David,

371
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
you'll remember when the Amalekites came in

372
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,519
and took all of the things in the camp

373
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,619
and took all of the folks,

374
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,459
you remember that the people,

375
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,859
they were ready to kill David,

376
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,100
they were ready to stone David,

377
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,459
and the Bible tells us that he encouraged himself

378
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,440
in the Lord.

379
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,259
Man, that could be a discouraging time

380
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,979
when the very people that you're ministering to

381
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,220
and leading are ready to stone you.

382
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,820
David encouraged himself in the Lord.

383
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,299
The Lord is the lifter up of mine head.

384
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:40,179
He's the one that sustains us.

385
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,899
See, when we understand who he is,

386
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,380
and obviously the text,

387
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,539
it's not exhaustive in verse number three,

388
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,739
it's just a few things that David mentions.

389
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:53,299
As he responds to the situation by prayer,

390
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,220
in prayer, we find that he starts first

391
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,380
by rehearsing who God is to him,

392
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,619
and as he says that he's a shield for me,

393
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,339
he's my glory, he's the lifter up of my head,

394
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,859
I note this evening that as we consider who he is to us,

395
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,820
that it will encourage us,

396
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,859
that it will strengthen us,

397
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,259
it'll change our focus to understanding

398
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,220
that our God is good, he's gracious,

399
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,899
he's sovereign, he is able.

400
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:25,259
Aren't you thankful that he's able?

401
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,579
And this evening, as we think about the faithfulness of God,

402
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,459
and we think about the way in which he sustains us,

403
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,660
we think about the way that he protects us,

404
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,619
that he provides that defense that we need,

405
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,500
that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

406
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,179
I understand that we face difficulties,

407
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,539
I understand that we have troubles and trials,

408
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,380
but when we shift our attention,

409
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,660
our focus from those things,

410
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,699
and we get our focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ,

411
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,619
it'll have an impact in our lives.

412
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,739
And I'm thankful that though our circumstances

413
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:04,579
and though our trials, our life can change

414
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,739
drastically and rapidly,

415
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:10,500
that God is a constant, that he remains the same.

416
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:15,459
He says, I change not.

417
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,579
Our circumstances change, right?

418
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,500
But God changes not.

419
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,739
So we see first in this response of prayer,

420
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:27,100
that first David rehearses who God is to him.

421
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,019
He says that it's personal and how precious that is.

422
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,219
Next, we find that David rejoices.

423
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:40,219
For this reason, he rejoices that God heard his voice.

424
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,700
Notice in verse number four,

425
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,739
he says, I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

426
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:51,179
and he heard me out of his holy hill, Sila.

427
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,619
We note that he says here in the phrase

428
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,580
in verse number four, with my voice,

429
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,619
I cried unto the Lord with my voice.

430
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,339
It would seem by using this phraseology,

431
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,219
it's an obvious reference to audible prayer.

432
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,339
Certainly, God hears silent prayer.

433
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,059
He knows the thoughts of his people.

434
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,859
He knows the thoughts of even everyone.

435
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,700
We know that the scribes and the Pharisees

436
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,779
and Sadducees would gather during the time

437
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:19,619
in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

438
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,020
and they would reason in their minds,

439
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,419
and Jesus would say, why are you thinking this way?

440
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:24,380
Why are you reasoning?

441
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,179
Or he'd answer their thought

442
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,619
before they'd even verbalize it.

443
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:32,099
But we find that here as we think about the psalmist

444
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:34,580
and we think about the reality of his situation,

445
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,500
and we find the response being one of prayer,

446
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,779
that he's crying out to the Lord, and it's audible.

447
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:46,859
And we find the fervency, if you will, of his prayer

448
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,619
as he's praying audibly.

449
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,979
I know that I've often mentioned over the years

450
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:55,419
that for me, it helps me personally to pray audibly.

451
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,659
It helps me to stay focused upon praying.

452
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:00,339
It helps me to stay just with...

453
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:05,259
some train of thought. I am talking to the Lord as I'm praying and as I talk

454
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:10,219
out loud. It helps me personally. I understand we always can't pray out

455
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:16,059
loud. I understand there are times in which it would be maybe not wise for us

456
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:21,459
to do so, but man, when we can pray with that audible voice it helps us, it helps

457
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:27,459
me, and we find that what causes David to rejoice greatly is the fact that he says

458
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:33,659
and he heard me, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Aren't you thankful this

459
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:39,739
evening that our God hears us when we pray? He hears us. I know it's a simple

460
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:46,219
truth of God's Word, but when we deal with the the problems, the troubles of

461
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:51,539
life, when we deal with the the circumstances that David is dealing with

462
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,819
in verses 1 & 2, when we have whatever that that set of circumstances are that

463
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,179
come into our lives, to have that confidence, to have that knowledge that

464
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:08,779
God hears us, oh, we ought to rejoice in that. And we find that when we can

465
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:14,699
acknowledge this evening that he hears us, that it ought to give us a peace. It

466
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:18,819
ought to give us a rest. We'll look at that next week, actually, in verses 5 & 6,

467
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,659
how that there's a rest that is the result of understanding that God hears

468
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,779
us. See, many times throughout the Scriptures, we have the opportunity to

469
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:34,819
see the contrast between Jehovah God and the many idols that people would serve.

470
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:40,099
And often, as you look at the Scriptures, the Bible will tell us of some of

471
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:46,859
those idols how they have ears, but they hear not, right? We find that often in the

472
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,059
Scriptures, and when you begin to think about the way in which they have eyes

473
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,459
and they see not, they have ears and they hear not, and you find those

474
00:21:55,459 --> 00:22:02,899
descriptions that are provided with regard to these idols, it's not true of

475
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,459
our God. Psalm 135, you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 135, the Bible says

476
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:12,099
this in verse number 15, the idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of

477
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:16,499
men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not. Eyes have they, but they see

478
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:21,139
not. They have ears, but they hear not. Neither is there any breath in their

479
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:27,979
mouths. But that's not a description of our God, because when we pray, He hears us.

480
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:34,539
Why was there such a theatrical performance that took place when Elijah

481
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:39,979
had the showdown with the the worshipers of Baal? I mean, they're crying and

482
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,899
they're cutting themselves and they're doing all of these things and all of

483
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:48,299
this theatrical type of a performance. Why? Because they're trying to get their

484
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:56,019
false God to answer. But He doesn't hear. Why? Because He's not a true God. But our

485
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:05,379
God, when we pray, He hears us. He hears. David says, first I'm going to rehearse

486
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:13,899
who God is to me. He's a shield for me. He's my glory. He's the lifter up of my

487
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:20,539
head. And I'm gonna rejoice because when I cried unto the Lord with my voice, He

488
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:27,339
heard me. He heard me out of His holy hill, Siloam. Begin to just meditate as we

489
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,299
think about the experience of David and we think about his response to the

490
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:39,379
situation. We say, oh, what a precious promise that the Lord has given us that

491
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:44,739
He says, I will hear you when you pray. Call unto me and I will answer thee and

492
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:48,859
show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. Solomon prayed a great

493
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:53,779
prayer of dedication as the temple was built and it was completed and it was

494
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:59,499
dedicated. And God responds by that great prayer of dedication by saying to

495
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:06,579
Solomon, I have heard thy prayer. That causes us to rejoice greatly that God

496
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:11,899
hears us. He answers in His time and according to His will, but we have this

497
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:19,099
confidence that He hears us. And we ought to rejoice greatly just as David is

498
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:24,539
rejoicing here in these verses of Scripture. I find the response of David to

499
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:31,059
be both encouraging and impactful. I find this evening that when I and when

500
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:35,819
you would face difficulties and trials and adversities, that when the

501
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:41,059
reality of our situation is such as what David faced here as he would pen the

502
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,779
words to this psalm under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

503
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:51,539
that we would focus upon how we respond. We're all gonna face difficulties. They're

504
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,179
gonna come in different shapes and different forms and from different

505
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,739
people and so on and so forth, but the reality is that we're all gonna face

506
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:08,259
difficulty. How we respond to that difficulty, how we respond to to that

507
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:14,779
situation is of utmost importance. And here we find that David prays. Notice in

508
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,579
closing just a few verses of Scripture just to actually turn to the book of

509
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:23,899
Psalms in the 55th chapter. Psalm 55. I'll give you two verses of Scripture that are

510
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:33,779
familiar to us. Psalm 55 and verse number 22. Psalm 55 and verse number 22. Notice

511
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:40,419
what the psalmist says here in this verse of Scripture. Cast thy burden upon

512
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:48,139
the Lord and He shall sustain thee. He shall never suffer the righteous to be

513
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:54,419
moved. Do we believe the Word of God? It says, cast thy burden upon the Lord and

514
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:01,299
He shall sustain thee. No doubt, even as David faced the situation that he faced,

515
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,059
that there are times in which we face opposition and difficulty and say, I

516
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:10,259
don't know how I could do this. I don't know how I can. We can't, but He can

517
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:19,659
sustain us. Amen? When I am weak, what did Paul say? Then I am strong. What did God

518
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:26,939
say to Paul? He besought the Lord thrice. God said, my grace is sufficient for thee.

519
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:33,139
God's grace is sufficient and He will sustain us. Notice another familiar verse

520
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:45,379
of Scripture. 1 Peter chapter number 5. 1 Peter chapter number 5. Here we find

521
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:55,259
that in verse number 7, Peter encourages these believers that he is writing to. By

522
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,219
the way, if you do some background study of the book of 1 Peter, it will help you

523
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:04,939
greatly to understand the great difficulties that they were facing. The

524
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:10,659
trial of their faith, the fiery trial as it's described in this book, under the

525
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:16,139
persecution of Nero, it was terrible. But notice what Peter says to

526
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,379
these believers in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 7. You know the verse.

527
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:33,339
Casting all your care upon Him. Why? For He careth for you. Casting all your care

528
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:39,819
upon Him, for He careth for you. See, there are times in which we like to hold

529
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,899
on to some of it. Maybe it makes us feel better. Maybe it helps us think we're

530
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,299
going to get sympathy. I don't know each situation and how they differ. But the

531
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,099
reality is that we need to cast all our care unto the Lord because He cares for

532
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:59,859
us. As I think about this truth in Psalm 3 and the response of David in these

533
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:06,899
verses of Scripture in Psalm 55 and in 1 Peter 5, I think of the way that the

534
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:12,179
songwriters were influenced by truth such as what we're dealing with this

535
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,939
evening. And I will not take a lot of time this evening to share some of the

536
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:22,179
words of these familiar hymns, but I want to just... I had several written down. I'm

537
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:27,579
just going to read the words to two familiar hymns to you this evening in closing. The

538
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:35,619
first one is written by Miss Hoffman and it's entitled, I Must Tell Jesus. We know

539
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:44,099
the song. I must tell Jesus all of my trials. I cannot bear these burdens alone.

540
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:52,139
In my distress, He kindly will help me. He ever loves and cares for His own. I

541
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:59,819
must tell Jesus all of my troubles. He is a kind, compassionate friend. If I but

542
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:06,259
ask Him, He will deliver. Make of my troubles quickly an end. Tempted and

543
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:12,979
tried, I need a great Savior, one who can help my burdens to bear. I must tell

544
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:22,019
Jesus, I must tell Jesus, He all my cares and sorrows will share. Oh, how the world

545
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:30,619
to evil allures me. Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin. I must tell Jesus, and He

546
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:37,419
will help me. Over the world, the victory to win. I must tell Jesus, I must tell

547
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:44,859
Jesus, I cannot bear these burdens alone. I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus,

548
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:54,539
Jesus can help me. Jesus alone. I believe that Miss Hoffman was greatly influenced

549
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,379
by some of the truth that we've looked at this evening.

550
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,839
I understand the great hymns of the faith.

551
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,439
I even mentioned this on Sunday evening

552
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:08,539
how many times these writers of these hymns,

553
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,039
they were greatly impacted and influenced

554
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,359
through the Word of God.

555
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,599
As they walked with God,

556
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,079
as they read and meditated upon the Word of God,

557
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:20,079
you can see in the words of the hymns that we sing

558
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,759
how that God's Word was so instrumental

559
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,239
in their lives.

560
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:31,299
Chapter 567 in our hymnal,

561
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,459
the title of the song is,

562
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:35,059
All Your Anxiety.

563
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,979
Is there a heart or bound by sorrow?

564
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:42,779
Is there a life weighed down by care?

565
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,379
Come to the cross, each burden bearing,

566
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:51,379
all your anxiety, leave it there.

567
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,059
No other friend so keen to help you.

568
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,899
No other friend so quick to hear.

569
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,579
No other place to leave your burden.

570
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,939
No other one to hear your prayer.

571
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:08,539
Come then at once, delay no longer.

572
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,099
Heed His entreaty, kind and sweet.

573
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,379
You need not fear a disappointment.

574
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:17,379
Ye shall find peace at the mercy seat.

575
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,899
All your anxiety, all your care,

576
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:24,579
bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

577
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,939
Never a burden He cannot bear.

578
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:32,019
Never a friend like Jesus.

579
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,699
The last phrase of the third verse of this song

580
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:40,259
says you shall find peace at the mercy seat.

581
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,219
And next week as we study Psalm 3

582
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,899
and verses 5 and 6,

583
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,299
the preview as I gave you a preview last week

584
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,699
to tonight's lesson,

585
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,939
the preview for next week's lesson,

586
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,059
is that in 5 and 6 of this psalm,

587
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,939
in those verses, you see a peace.

588
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,859
You see a rest.

589
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,779
And what a blessing.

590
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:04,299
Because when we understand who He is to me,

591
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,899
and I rehearse it, I remind myself,

592
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:13,139
Lord, Thou art a shield for me.

593
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:18,139
My glory, the lifter up of mine head.

594
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,939
I cried unto Thee with my voice,

595
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,419
and He heard me.

596
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,459
He heard me.

597
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,299
Out of His holy hill, Sila.

598
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,779
David, as he's praying,

599
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:36,579
as he responds to this difficulty that he's facing,

600
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,499
it's exemplary for us.

601
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,499
It's encouraging

602
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,779
as we see the way that the Lord would sustain him.

603
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,739
The situation was real.

604
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:47,539
This was not a figment of his imagination.

605
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,619
This was not an exaggeration.

606
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,939
This was not an embellishment.

607
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:55,499
No, this was a real situation he was dealing with.

608
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:58,579
But his response is noteworthy.

609
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,939
And it's summed up in one word, prayer.

610
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,819
We change our focus from all of our trouble

611
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,939
and all of our care and all of our burdens,

612
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:09,339
and we change our focus from all of that,

613
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:12,979
and we get our focus on our Savior

614
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,939
and who He is to us

615
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:19,019
and how it changes the situation.

616
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,019
Let's pray together.

617
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:21,619
We love you.

618
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:23,459
We thank you for loving us.

619
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,019
We thank you for this psalm.

620
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,299
And I believe this evening

621
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,339
that as we have the opportunity

622
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:34,059
to slowly walk through the verses of this psalm,

623
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,179
God, You would use it in our hearts and lives

624
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,259
to encourage us and to strengthen us.

625
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,419
No doubt, we face difficulties

626
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,899
and we deal with adversities.

627
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,499
But God, I thank You

628
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,539
for those of us that have been born again,

629
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,219
we're saved, we've been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ.

630
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:57,099
You're our Savior, our Helper.

631
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,099
And we will lift up our eyes into the hills

632
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:01,139
from whence cometh our help,

633
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,779
knowing that You're the Creator

634
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,779
and the Sustainer of all things.

635
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,259
God, I'm thankful that You are a shield for me

636
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:11,819
just as You were for David.

637
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:16,419
You provide the protection and the defense that we need.

638
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,059
God, I thank You that You're constant, consistent,

639
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,859
though all of our circumstances can change quickly

640
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,259
and drastically,

641
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,939
You remain the same.

642
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,779
You're our glory.

643
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:31,259
The lifter up of mine head,

644
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:34,939
though the circumstances can become discouraging.

645
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,339
God, I thank You

646
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:40,659
that You encourage us through Your Word,

647
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,859
through the Holy Spirit of God,

648
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:44,099
through other believers.

649
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,659
At times, even as David did,

650
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,979
we have to encourage ourselves in the Lord.

651
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:50,779
I pray, God, that You'd bless our time of prayer.

652
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:53,299
We thank You for the privilege,

653
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,979
even as David rejoiced in that next verse of Scripture.

654
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:58,659
Why? Because You heard him.

655
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:00,659
We understand this evening that when we pray,

656
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,819
You hear us.

657
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,659
That You're able to do exceeding abundantly

658
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,979
above all that we ask or think.

659
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,779
Bless our time, and we'll thank You for it.

660
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:11,779
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
