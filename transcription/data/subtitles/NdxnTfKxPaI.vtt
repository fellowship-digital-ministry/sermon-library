00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
number three this evening, Psalm 3.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.360
And last week we started a four-part series from Psalm 3.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.659
And I mentioned to you that there are eight verses

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.319
in this particular psalm,

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.600
and really four divisions, two verses each.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.559
And so last week we looked at verses one and two.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.600
And as we examined the first two verses of Psalm 3,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.139
we saw the reality of the situation that David faced.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.719
You'll remember that this psalm,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.100
if you think about the background of this psalm

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.719
and the setting for this psalm,

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.659
was during the time of Absalom's rebellion and his revolt.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.779
And as we begin to notice and look back

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.299
at 2 Samuel 15 and 16,

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.020
and look through those chapters that record for us

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.240
the event that David is going through,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.099
we will find that as we look at this text of scripture,

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:56.040
this is not an exaggeration on the part of David.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.099
This is not some type of an assumption

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:02.340
on the part of David.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.979
We find that this is reality.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.279
This is what he was facing.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:06.940
This is what he was dealing with.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.580
We find that it was in verse number one

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.860
that he says, they are increased that trouble me.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.500
They are increased that trouble me.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.260
He says again in verse number one,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.139
we used it as the title of the message last week,

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:23.680
many are they that rise up against me.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:26.580
And so they've increased those that trouble me.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.019
There are many that rise up against me.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:31.779
We find that he said this in verse number two,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.220
that they were saying of David,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.139
there is no help for him in God.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.019
God's not even gonna be able to help him in this situation.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:45.059
I'm thankful that our God is a very present help

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:46.940
in the time of trouble, amen.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.739
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us,

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.459
lift up our eyes into the hills

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:51.739
from whence cometh our help.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.760
Our help cometh from the Lord,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.199
which made heaven and earth.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.160
And not only is he able to help,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.400
but he is available to help.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.480
And I'm so thankful for the truth of God's word

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.379
with regard to that statement,

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.820
that reality of the help that God provides.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.779
As we think about the truth of this passage of scripture

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.279
being a reality, not an exaggeration,

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.800
not a possibility that they're going to rise against me,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.399
but a reality, it was told to us in 2 Samuel 15,

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:26.720
and verse number 12,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.399
and the conspiracy was strong

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.399
for the people increased continually with Absalom.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360
We find that this was the situation

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.919
in which David was facing,

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.380
and it was a real situation.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.440
The reality is painted, is provided to us

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.979
in verses one and two.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.240
This evening, as we examine and continue

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.559
through the portion of scripture,

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.479
we'll look at verses three and four,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.839
and really we'll consider tonight the response,

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.759
David's response to the situation.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.160
We see the reality last week,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.820
but I mentioned even as we closed last Wednesday evening,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.320
that certainly we face troubles, we face difficulties.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.679
There are people that will oppose those of us

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.339
as we will stand for biblical truth.

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.080
We will face opposition.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.880
There are many adversaries.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.839
We understand that.

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.279
We read the word of God,

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.320
and we understand that every time

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.759
someone attempts to do something for God,

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.479
there's going to be opposition.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.479
There's going to be adversity.

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.779
But how do we respond to that opposition?

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.479
How is it that we respond to the adversity that we face?

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.080
How is it that we respond to those that would trouble us,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.119
those that would speak ill of us?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.080
What is it that we do?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.779
How is it that we respond?

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.979
And tonight, we'll deal with the response

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.020
of David to this situation.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.919
I would say this, in a single word,

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.320
his response is one of prayer.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.639
And that's a simple way of looking at verses three and four.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.000
If you are taking notes and want a title

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.360
for the message this evening,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.119
it would be from verse number four.

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:04.800
I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.000
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.160
I want you to notice in the response,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.320
look at verse three and four, the Bible says,

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:20.399
but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:26.119
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:29.440
I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.440
and He heard me out of His holy hill, Sila.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.640
As we look at these verses of Scripture

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.920
and consider the response of David to the situation,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.459
I want you to notice, first of all,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.859
that David rehearses who God is to him.

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:50.179
In this act of rehearsing, in verse number three,

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.739
as he rehearses, it's really a reminder to himself.

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:57.019
And oftentimes as we pray, we've often mentioned,

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.899
I've said, and I've encouraged,

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.940
and I've even revealed to you personally

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.179
how in my own prayer time,

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.179
how I begin my prayer time with a time of adoration,

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.380
praising God for who He is.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.579
And also not only who He is

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.660
and His attributes and His character,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.619
but really who He is to me.

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.220
And we begin to consider oftentimes

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.380
throughout the Scriptures,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.100
we find that He is my advocate.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.540
He is my shepherd.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.299
He is my forerunner.

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:29.220
He is my great high priest.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.739
We begin to think about these things,

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:32.820
and as we rehearse those things,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.140
we're reminding ourselves of who God is to us.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.179
I'm thankful that He's my Savior,

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:41.019
and I'm thankful that He is the Savior of the world,

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.179
but you think about the truth

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.579
that He's my Savior personally,

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:47.380
and David, we find in verse number three,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.940
he says, but thou, O Lord, are a shield for me,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.260
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.339
So we find that in verse number three,

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.380
we spoke that his response is one of prayer,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.820
that he's praying.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.179
We see that in verse number four,

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.779
he says, I cried unto the Lord.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.859
But we notice in verse number three

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:09.019
as he speaks about who God is to him,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:10.980
I want you to consider this evening

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.220
that as we respond to situations

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.220
such as what David was facing,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.100
that which he was dealing with,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.940
when we deal with adversity,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.540
when we deal with opposition,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.019
when we deal with trouble and trials,

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.179
when we respond in prayer,

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:31.980
when we respond by first rehearsing who God is to me,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.220
when we recognize and remind ourselves

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.980
of who He is, it's encouraging.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.179
It encourages us, it strengthens us,

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:44.859
and it helps us to shift our focus.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:48.540
Sometimes what happens in the time of trial,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.660
in the time of trouble, in the time of difficulty,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.980
is that all we can focus upon is that trouble, right?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.420
It just consumes us,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.899
and we just are so focused upon the trouble and the trial

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.140
and the opposition and the adversity,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.940
and it sucks all of our attention and all of our time,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.220
and we're so focused on those things.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.540
And when we begin to pray,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.739
we begin to rehearse who God is to us,

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:18.980
it's a shift in focus.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.660
No longer am I focusing on woe is me,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.260
no longer am I focusing on my problem, my trouble, my trial,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.779
but we find that here in Psalm 3,

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.940
as David understands the reality of the situation

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.059
in the first two verses,

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:35.100
his response is one of prayer,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.820
and he begins that prayer by rehearsing who God is to him.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.820
First of all, he says that He is a shield for me.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.140
But thou, O Lord, verse number three,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.820
art a shield for me.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.940
Oftentimes throughout the book of Psalms,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.700
we find that the Word of God teaches us

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.260
and reveals to us that our God is a shield and a buckler.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.299
We find that this is the first reference

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:09.019
of God being a shield for me in the book of Psalms.

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:11.540
And we find that David, as he says,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.100
as he makes this declaration,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.579
as he rehearses who God is to him,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:20.540
when he reminds himself that God, Jehovah, the Creator,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.500
the King of kings, the Lord of lords,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.500
that He is a shield for me.

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:29.299
Think about that.

00:08:29.299 --> 00:08:32.059
I mean, he's dealing with great adversity.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.900
Remember, those that were increased,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.059
that were troubling him,

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.820
we find that he said there were many

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.419
that rise up against him.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.539
It says that in verse number two,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.940
that those enemies were saying of him

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.659
that there is no help for him in God.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.940
And we find that David, he responds,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.940
though the conspiracy was strong

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.700
and though the people increased continually with Absalom,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.739
we find that he begins to remind himself

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:00.219
as he rehearses and he says,

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:04.340
Lord, Thou art a shield for me.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.099
What does a shield do?

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.059
A shield provides defense.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.979
A shield provides protection.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.099
And we think about the imagery

00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:17.700
and we think about the understanding

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.340
as David is praying and he's rehearsing

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.659
who God is to him,

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:26.659
he begins by saying, Lord, you're my shield.

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:32.619
Lord, you art a shield for me.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.780
I love the fact that he says for me

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.219
because it's personal.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:40.299
It's precious.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:42.140
When you think about it in those terms,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.340
often we've made the statement

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.219
as we've considered the 23rd Psalm,

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:47.859
the Lord is my shepherd

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.820
and all of the personal pronouns

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.179
that are used by the Psalmist

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:53.460
in that wonderful, familiar Psalm.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.780
And we find that that brings great comfort to our hearts.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.179
It encourages us and it strengthens us.

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:03.859
And here, as David is rehearsing who God is,

00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.219
yes, he's dealing with great adversity,

00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:07.719
with great opposition,

00:10:07.719 --> 00:10:08.479
but he says,

00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:14.119
"...but Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me."

00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:18.439
They may say that there's no help for him in God,

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:21.399
but God, I know that You're my shield.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:23.379
Isn't that precious?

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.099
And we see, do you notice how there's a shift in focus?

00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:28.939
Do we notice how that, yes,

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:32.619
the reality of the situation is given to us in verses 1 and 2?

00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:34.919
Indeed, this is not just an assumption.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:36.919
This is not an exaggeration.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:40.799
There was real trouble.

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:44.599
But instead of being consumed and focused upon just the trouble

00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:48.159
and the many adversaries and all of the problems,

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.399
his attention, why?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.739
Because he responded in prayer,

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:55.899
his attention, his focus is shifted not to his problem,

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:57.739
but to his God.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:01.379
And how precious that is.

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:03.219
Someone said this,

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:07.099
we need to simply glance at our circumstances,

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:10.159
but we need to gaze at our Savior.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:11.599
And I like that.

00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:13.199
Because Hebrews 12 says,

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:15.499
"...looking unto Jesus,

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:18.259
the Author and Finisher of our faith."

00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:23.739
So often, however, we find ourselves as we live this life,

00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:27.579
when we go through difficulties and trials and troubles,

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:32.219
that we actually gaze upon our problems

00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:35.599
and simply glance at our Savior.

00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:38.319
And how it's not the way it ought to be.

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:40.399
We think of Peter.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:44.599
Often times, we think of Peter when he walked on water.

00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:46.999
What happened when he walked on the water?

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:49.339
Where was his attention fixed?

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:52.179
I don't know how many steps he took out of the boat,

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:55.519
but I find in my sanctified imagination

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:57.219
as I would look at that scene,

00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:00.959
I find that Peter is zeroed in, he is gazing,

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.459
he is focused upon the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:04.359
and he says,

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:09.259
Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come to Thee.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.799
And what does Jesus say?

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:12.359
Come.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:13.839
And what does Peter do?

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.399
He walks.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.099
Was the storm raging?

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:18.839
Were the waves tempestuous?

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:20.139
Was the wind boisterous?

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.879
Absolutely.

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:24.619
But he's focused upon Jesus.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.719
And he walked on water.

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:29.219
And what happened to Peter?

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.079
His focus changed.

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:32.279
Right?

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.119
What do you look at?

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:34.819
Man, the wind, the waves,

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:37.099
the reality of what he was facing,

00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:39.159
and he began to sink.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.659
What's the Bible tell us?

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:41.500
He was wise.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.099
He said, Lord, help.

00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:45.639
And the Lord graciously brought him up.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.039
And I believe with all my heart

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:50.199
that he walked on water back to the boat.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:52.299
However far he got out of the ship,

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:55.679
he had to walk that far back with the Lord.

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.379
And we find that here,

00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:59.000
as we note the response,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.039
we find that David begins first

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:05.119
by rehearsing who God is to him.

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:05.959
That's why it's so important

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:08.959
that we know the Word of God.

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:12.599
And we know who He is to us.

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:14.439
And we understand this evening

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:16.500
that David begins by saying,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.639
Thou art a shield for me.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:21.000
The defense that I need, Lord, You provide.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.239
The protection that I so desperately need

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.719
in this situation, in this trial,

00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:27.719
in this adversity that I'm facing,

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:30.899
Lord, You're the one that's going to provide that for me.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.739
Notice he continues.

00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:38.479
He says, My glory, my glory,

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:40.039
honor, glory.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.779
Though David's circumstances had changed rapidly

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.619
and drastically,

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:47.119
I want you to consider the fact

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:49.119
that the Lord is constant.

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:50.399
He's consistent.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.399
He never changes.

00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:53.819
He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.399
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:57.919
We mentioned about the immutability of the Lord.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:59.579
He never changes.

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:01.779
And though our circumstances change,

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:04.639
and though we can deal with adversity,

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.819
and we can have moments in life

00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:08.579
that some have referred to as being

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.619
roller coaster type of events,

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:13.739
and we can see the ups and downs of life,

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:16.079
we find that our God remains constant.

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:18.220
And it's He that is our glory.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.539
And we look to Him,

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.519
and we find that David is focused upon

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:27.220
the constant and the consistent nature of our God.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.739
He says this at the end of verse number three,

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:35.220
and the lifter up of mine head.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.019
What happens sometimes when we deal

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.220
with troubles and trials?

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.380
We get discouraged.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.639
Do we not?

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:42.479
We're human.

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:44.220
God knows that we're but dust.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.100
He formed us.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.459
He made us.

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:47.299
Right?

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:48.119
He knows our frame.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.639
He knows that we're but dust.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.479
And we find that oftentimes as we deal with

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:56.380
opposition and adversity and troubles and trials in life,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.919
that it is possible for us to get discouraged.

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:01.399
And one thing that happens when we get discouraged

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:03.079
is sometimes we have our head down.

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:03.959
Do we not?

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.479
We have our head down.

00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:10.199
We're discouraged.

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:12.479
Sometimes you can just see in the countenance

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:13.720
of an individual,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.539
you don't even know what they're dealing with.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.979
You don't know what their life consists of,

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:21.100
but you can see in their countenance

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.979
that they're discouraged.

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:23.899
Right?

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:24.940
We've lived long enough.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.959
We can see.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.979
We can understand when someone's dealing with something.

00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:29.419
We may not know what it is,

00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:33.179
but we can tell when someone's discouraged.

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:36.859
And David, though again his circumstances

00:15:36.859 --> 00:15:39.139
had changed rapidly and drastically,

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.859
and though there's the opportunity for discouragement

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.139
and disheartened and all those things,

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:48.739
we find that it is the Lord who sustains us.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.019
He is the lifter up of mine head.

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:57.979
This is a different circumstance here in Psalm 3

00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.799
that would result in the writing of this particular Psalm.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:03.979
It's at the rebellion and revolt of Absalom,

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:05.820
but we find that David,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.820
you'll remember when the Amalekites came in

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.519
and took all of the things in the camp

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.619
and took all of the folks,

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.459
you remember that the people,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.859
they were ready to kill David,

00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:17.100
they were ready to stone David,

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.459
and the Bible tells us that he encouraged himself

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:21.440
in the Lord.

00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:24.259
Man, that could be a discouraging time

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:26.979
when the very people that you're ministering to

00:16:26.979 --> 00:16:29.220
and leading are ready to stone you.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.820
David encouraged himself in the Lord.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.299
The Lord is the lifter up of mine head.

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:40.179
He's the one that sustains us.

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.899
See, when we understand who he is,

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.380
and obviously the text,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.539
it's not exhaustive in verse number three,

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:49.739
it's just a few things that David mentions.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:53.299
As he responds to the situation by prayer,

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:56.220
in prayer, we find that he starts first

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.380
by rehearsing who God is to him,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.619
and as he says that he's a shield for me,

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.339
he's my glory, he's the lifter up of my head,

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:07.859
I note this evening that as we consider who he is to us,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.820
that it will encourage us,

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.859
that it will strengthen us,

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.259
it'll change our focus to understanding

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:20.220
that our God is good, he's gracious,

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.899
he's sovereign, he is able.

00:17:22.899 --> 00:17:25.259
Aren't you thankful that he's able?

00:17:25.259 --> 00:17:28.579
And this evening, as we think about the faithfulness of God,

00:17:28.579 --> 00:17:31.459
and we think about the way in which he sustains us,

00:17:31.459 --> 00:17:33.660
we think about the way that he protects us,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.619
that he provides that defense that we need,

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:39.500
that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:42.179
I understand that we face difficulties,

00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:45.539
I understand that we have troubles and trials,

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:47.380
but when we shift our attention,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.660
our focus from those things,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.699
and we get our focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:56.619
it'll have an impact in our lives.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:59.739
And I'm thankful that though our circumstances

00:17:59.739 --> 00:18:04.579
and though our trials, our life can change

00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:06.739
drastically and rapidly,

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:10.500
that God is a constant, that he remains the same.

00:18:11.699 --> 00:18:15.459
He says, I change not.

00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:18.579
Our circumstances change, right?

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:20.500
But God changes not.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.739
So we see first in this response of prayer,

00:18:23.739 --> 00:18:27.100
that first David rehearses who God is to him.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.019
He says that it's personal and how precious that is.

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:35.219
Next, we find that David rejoices.

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:40.219
For this reason, he rejoices that God heard his voice.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.700
Notice in verse number four,

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.739
he says, I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:51.179
and he heard me out of his holy hill, Sila.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.619
We note that he says here in the phrase

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:57.580
in verse number four, with my voice,

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.619
I cried unto the Lord with my voice.

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:02.339
It would seem by using this phraseology,

00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:06.219
it's an obvious reference to audible prayer.

00:19:06.219 --> 00:19:08.339
Certainly, God hears silent prayer.

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:10.059
He knows the thoughts of his people.

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:12.859
He knows the thoughts of even everyone.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:14.700
We know that the scribes and the Pharisees

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.779
and Sadducees would gather during the time

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.619
in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:21.020
and they would reason in their minds,

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.419
and Jesus would say, why are you thinking this way?

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:24.380
Why are you reasoning?

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.179
Or he'd answer their thought

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.619
before they'd even verbalize it.

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:32.099
But we find that here as we think about the psalmist

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:34.580
and we think about the reality of his situation,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.500
and we find the response being one of prayer,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.779
that he's crying out to the Lord, and it's audible.

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:46.859
And we find the fervency, if you will, of his prayer

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:48.619
as he's praying audibly.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.979
I know that I've often mentioned over the years

00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:55.419
that for me, it helps me personally to pray audibly.

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:57.659
It helps me to stay focused upon praying.

00:19:57.659 --> 00:20:00.339
It helps me to stay just with...

00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:05.259
some train of thought. I am talking to the Lord as I'm praying and as I talk

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:10.219
out loud. It helps me personally. I understand we always can't pray out

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:16.059
loud. I understand there are times in which it would be maybe not wise for us

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:21.459
to do so, but man, when we can pray with that audible voice it helps us, it helps

00:20:21.459 --> 00:20:27.459
me, and we find that what causes David to rejoice greatly is the fact that he says

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:33.659
and he heard me, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Aren't you thankful this

00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:39.739
evening that our God hears us when we pray? He hears us. I know it's a simple

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:46.219
truth of God's Word, but when we deal with the the problems, the troubles of

00:20:46.219 --> 00:20:51.539
life, when we deal with the the circumstances that David is dealing with

00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:56.819
in verses 1 & 2, when we have whatever that that set of circumstances are that

00:20:56.819 --> 00:21:02.179
come into our lives, to have that confidence, to have that knowledge that

00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:08.779
God hears us, oh, we ought to rejoice in that. And we find that when we can

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:14.699
acknowledge this evening that he hears us, that it ought to give us a peace. It

00:21:14.699 --> 00:21:18.819
ought to give us a rest. We'll look at that next week, actually, in verses 5 & 6,

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:23.659
how that there's a rest that is the result of understanding that God hears

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:28.779
us. See, many times throughout the Scriptures, we have the opportunity to

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:34.819
see the contrast between Jehovah God and the many idols that people would serve.

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:40.099
And often, as you look at the Scriptures, the Bible will tell us of some of

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:46.859
those idols how they have ears, but they hear not, right? We find that often in the

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:51.059
Scriptures, and when you begin to think about the way in which they have eyes

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:55.459
and they see not, they have ears and they hear not, and you find those

00:21:55.459 --> 00:22:02.899
descriptions that are provided with regard to these idols, it's not true of

00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:08.459
our God. Psalm 135, you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 135, the Bible says

00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:12.099
this in verse number 15, the idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:16.499
men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not. Eyes have they, but they see

00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:21.139
not. They have ears, but they hear not. Neither is there any breath in their

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:27.979
mouths. But that's not a description of our God, because when we pray, He hears us.

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:34.539
Why was there such a theatrical performance that took place when Elijah

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:39.979
had the showdown with the the worshipers of Baal? I mean, they're crying and

00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:42.899
they're cutting themselves and they're doing all of these things and all of

00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:48.299
this theatrical type of a performance. Why? Because they're trying to get their

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:56.019
false God to answer. But He doesn't hear. Why? Because He's not a true God. But our

00:22:56.019 --> 00:23:05.379
God, when we pray, He hears us. He hears. David says, first I'm going to rehearse

00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:13.899
who God is to me. He's a shield for me. He's my glory. He's the lifter up of my

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:20.539
head. And I'm gonna rejoice because when I cried unto the Lord with my voice, He

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:27.339
heard me. He heard me out of His holy hill, Siloam. Begin to just meditate as we

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:31.299
think about the experience of David and we think about his response to the

00:23:31.299 --> 00:23:39.379
situation. We say, oh, what a precious promise that the Lord has given us that

00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:44.739
He says, I will hear you when you pray. Call unto me and I will answer thee and

00:23:44.739 --> 00:23:48.859
show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. Solomon prayed a great

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:53.779
prayer of dedication as the temple was built and it was completed and it was

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:59.499
dedicated. And God responds by that great prayer of dedication by saying to

00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:06.579
Solomon, I have heard thy prayer. That causes us to rejoice greatly that God

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:11.899
hears us. He answers in His time and according to His will, but we have this

00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:19.099
confidence that He hears us. And we ought to rejoice greatly just as David is

00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:24.539
rejoicing here in these verses of Scripture. I find the response of David to

00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:31.059
be both encouraging and impactful. I find this evening that when I and when

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:35.819
you would face difficulties and trials and adversities, that when the

00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:41.059
reality of our situation is such as what David faced here as he would pen the

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:43.779
words to this psalm under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:51.539
that we would focus upon how we respond. We're all gonna face difficulties. They're

00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:55.179
gonna come in different shapes and different forms and from different

00:24:55.179 --> 00:24:59.739
people and so on and so forth, but the reality is that we're all gonna face

00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:08.259
difficulty. How we respond to that difficulty, how we respond to to that

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:14.779
situation is of utmost importance. And here we find that David prays. Notice in

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:18.579
closing just a few verses of Scripture just to actually turn to the book of

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:23.899
Psalms in the 55th chapter. Psalm 55. I'll give you two verses of Scripture that are

00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:33.779
familiar to us. Psalm 55 and verse number 22. Psalm 55 and verse number 22. Notice

00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:40.419
what the psalmist says here in this verse of Scripture. Cast thy burden upon

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:48.139
the Lord and He shall sustain thee. He shall never suffer the righteous to be

00:25:48.139 --> 00:25:54.419
moved. Do we believe the Word of God? It says, cast thy burden upon the Lord and

00:25:54.419 --> 00:26:01.299
He shall sustain thee. No doubt, even as David faced the situation that he faced,

00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:05.059
that there are times in which we face opposition and difficulty and say, I

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:10.259
don't know how I could do this. I don't know how I can. We can't, but He can

00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:19.659
sustain us. Amen? When I am weak, what did Paul say? Then I am strong. What did God

00:26:19.659 --> 00:26:26.939
say to Paul? He besought the Lord thrice. God said, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:26:26.939 --> 00:26:33.139
God's grace is sufficient and He will sustain us. Notice another familiar verse

00:26:33.139 --> 00:26:45.379
of Scripture. 1 Peter chapter number 5. 1 Peter chapter number 5. Here we find

00:26:45.379 --> 00:26:55.259
that in verse number 7, Peter encourages these believers that he is writing to. By

00:26:55.259 --> 00:26:59.219
the way, if you do some background study of the book of 1 Peter, it will help you

00:26:59.219 --> 00:27:04.939
greatly to understand the great difficulties that they were facing. The

00:27:04.939 --> 00:27:10.659
trial of their faith, the fiery trial as it's described in this book, under the

00:27:10.659 --> 00:27:16.139
persecution of Nero, it was terrible. But notice what Peter says to

00:27:16.139 --> 00:27:20.379
these believers in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 7. You know the verse.

00:27:20.659 --> 00:27:33.339
Casting all your care upon Him. Why? For He careth for you. Casting all your care

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:39.819
upon Him, for He careth for you. See, there are times in which we like to hold

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:43.899
on to some of it. Maybe it makes us feel better. Maybe it helps us think we're

00:27:43.899 --> 00:27:49.299
going to get sympathy. I don't know each situation and how they differ. But the

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:54.099
reality is that we need to cast all our care unto the Lord because He cares for

00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:59.859
us. As I think about this truth in Psalm 3 and the response of David in these

00:27:59.859 --> 00:28:06.899
verses of Scripture in Psalm 55 and in 1 Peter 5, I think of the way that the

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:12.179
songwriters were influenced by truth such as what we're dealing with this

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:16.939
evening. And I will not take a lot of time this evening to share some of the

00:28:16.939 --> 00:28:22.179
words of these familiar hymns, but I want to just... I had several written down. I'm

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:27.579
just going to read the words to two familiar hymns to you this evening in closing. The

00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:35.619
first one is written by Miss Hoffman and it's entitled, I Must Tell Jesus. We know

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:44.099
the song. I must tell Jesus all of my trials. I cannot bear these burdens alone.

00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:52.139
In my distress, He kindly will help me. He ever loves and cares for His own. I

00:28:52.139 --> 00:28:59.819
must tell Jesus all of my troubles. He is a kind, compassionate friend. If I but

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:06.259
ask Him, He will deliver. Make of my troubles quickly an end. Tempted and

00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:12.979
tried, I need a great Savior, one who can help my burdens to bear. I must tell

00:29:12.979 --> 00:29:22.019
Jesus, I must tell Jesus, He all my cares and sorrows will share. Oh, how the world

00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:30.619
to evil allures me. Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin. I must tell Jesus, and He

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:37.419
will help me. Over the world, the victory to win. I must tell Jesus, I must tell

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:44.859
Jesus, I cannot bear these burdens alone. I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus,

00:29:44.859 --> 00:29:54.539
Jesus can help me. Jesus alone. I believe that Miss Hoffman was greatly influenced

00:29:54.539 --> 00:30:00.379
by some of the truth that we've looked at this evening.

00:30:00.379 --> 00:30:02.839
I understand the great hymns of the faith.

00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:05.439
I even mentioned this on Sunday evening

00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:08.539
how many times these writers of these hymns,

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:11.039
they were greatly impacted and influenced

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:13.359
through the Word of God.

00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:14.599
As they walked with God,

00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:17.079
as they read and meditated upon the Word of God,

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:20.079
you can see in the words of the hymns that we sing

00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:22.759
how that God's Word was so instrumental

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:28.239
in their lives.

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:31.299
Chapter 567 in our hymnal,

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:32.459
the title of the song is,

00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:35.059
All Your Anxiety.

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:38.979
Is there a heart or bound by sorrow?

00:30:38.979 --> 00:30:42.779
Is there a life weighed down by care?

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:46.379
Come to the cross, each burden bearing,

00:30:46.379 --> 00:30:51.379
all your anxiety, leave it there.

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:54.059
No other friend so keen to help you.

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:56.899
No other friend so quick to hear.

00:30:56.899 --> 00:30:59.579
No other place to leave your burden.

00:30:59.579 --> 00:31:03.939
No other one to hear your prayer.

00:31:03.939 --> 00:31:08.539
Come then at once, delay no longer.

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:11.099
Heed His entreaty, kind and sweet.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:13.379
You need not fear a disappointment.

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:17.379
Ye shall find peace at the mercy seat.

00:31:17.379 --> 00:31:20.899
All your anxiety, all your care,

00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:24.579
bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

00:31:24.579 --> 00:31:27.939
Never a burden He cannot bear.

00:31:27.939 --> 00:31:32.019
Never a friend like Jesus.

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:35.699
The last phrase of the third verse of this song

00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:40.259
says you shall find peace at the mercy seat.

00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:43.219
And next week as we study Psalm 3

00:31:43.219 --> 00:31:45.899
and verses 5 and 6,

00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:48.299
the preview as I gave you a preview last week

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:49.699
to tonight's lesson,

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.939
the preview for next week's lesson,

00:31:51.939 --> 00:31:54.059
is that in 5 and 6 of this psalm,

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:57.939
in those verses, you see a peace.

00:31:57.939 --> 00:31:59.859
You see a rest.

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:01.779
And what a blessing.

00:32:01.779 --> 00:32:04.299
Because when we understand who He is to me,

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:06.899
and I rehearse it, I remind myself,

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:13.139
Lord, Thou art a shield for me.

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:18.139
My glory, the lifter up of mine head.

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:21.939
I cried unto Thee with my voice,

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:24.419
and He heard me.

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:27.459
He heard me.

00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:30.299
Out of His holy hill, Sila.

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:32.779
David, as he's praying,

00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:36.579
as he responds to this difficulty that he's facing,

00:32:36.579 --> 00:32:38.499
it's exemplary for us.

00:32:38.499 --> 00:32:40.499
It's encouraging

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:43.779
as we see the way that the Lord would sustain him.

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:45.739
The situation was real.

00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:47.539
This was not a figment of his imagination.

00:32:47.539 --> 00:32:49.619
This was not an exaggeration.

00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:50.939
This was not an embellishment.

00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:55.499
No, this was a real situation he was dealing with.

00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:58.579
But his response is noteworthy.

00:32:58.579 --> 00:33:01.939
And it's summed up in one word, prayer.

00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:04.819
We change our focus from all of our trouble

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:06.939
and all of our care and all of our burdens,

00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:09.339
and we change our focus from all of that,

00:33:09.339 --> 00:33:12.979
and we get our focus on our Savior

00:33:12.979 --> 00:33:14.939
and who He is to us

00:33:14.939 --> 00:33:19.019
and how it changes the situation.

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:20.019
Let's pray together.

00:33:20.059 --> 00:33:21.619
We love you.

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:23.459
We thank you for loving us.

00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:26.019
We thank you for this psalm.

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:27.299
And I believe this evening

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:30.339
that as we have the opportunity

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:34.059
to slowly walk through the verses of this psalm,

00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:36.179
God, You would use it in our hearts and lives

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:39.259
to encourage us and to strengthen us.

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:41.419
No doubt, we face difficulties

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:45.899
and we deal with adversities.

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:48.499
But God, I thank You

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:50.539
for those of us that have been born again,

00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:54.219
we're saved, we've been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:33:54.219 --> 00:33:57.099
You're our Savior, our Helper.

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:59.099
And we will lift up our eyes into the hills

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:01.139
from whence cometh our help,

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:02.779
knowing that You're the Creator

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:05.779
and the Sustainer of all things.

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:09.259
God, I'm thankful that You are a shield for me

00:34:09.259 --> 00:34:11.819
just as You were for David.

00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:16.419
You provide the protection and the defense that we need.

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:19.059
God, I thank You that You're constant, consistent,

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:21.859
though all of our circumstances can change quickly

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:25.259
and drastically,

00:34:25.259 --> 00:34:26.939
You remain the same.

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:28.779
You're our glory.

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:31.259
The lifter up of mine head,

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:34.939
though the circumstances can become discouraging.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:37.339
God, I thank You

00:34:37.339 --> 00:34:40.659
that You encourage us through Your Word,

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:41.859
through the Holy Spirit of God,

00:34:41.859 --> 00:34:44.099
through other believers.

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:45.659
At times, even as David did,

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.979
we have to encourage ourselves in the Lord.

00:34:48.979 --> 00:34:50.779
I pray, God, that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:53.299
We thank You for the privilege,

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:55.979
even as David rejoiced in that next verse of Scripture.

00:34:55.979 --> 00:34:58.659
Why? Because You heard him.

00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:00.659
We understand this evening that when we pray,

00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:03.819
You hear us.

00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:05.659
That You're able to do exceeding abundantly

00:35:05.659 --> 00:35:07.979
above all that we ask or think.

00:35:07.979 --> 00:35:09.779
Bless our time, and we'll thank You for it.

00:35:09.779 --> 00:35:11.779
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
