1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
week is the better way to put that and they indicated that here's how I feel

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:12,000
when I'm in church and it's cold and it was a group text message and Holly

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,760
promptly responded back with a an emoji of a sweaty person saying and

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,479
this is how pastor feels when he's preaching and I was quite comical and I

5
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:28,959
have said for years I do not set the thermostat to what it would cause me to

6
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:34,639
be comfortable because all of you would be very much freezing and I said it to

7
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:39,880
try to accommodate as many within the middle group as I can you don't want my

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,200
dad controlling the thermostat that's for sure and it will be freezing and so

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,560
anyhow it is not helpful having all these windows and doors open but we

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,279
understand to increase some airflow and so Lord willing we won't have to do that

11
00:00:55,279 --> 00:01:00,639
too much longer Proverbs chapter number 13 this evening I'm going to tell you

12
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,880
right from the beginning we're not going to be here long I'm going to use a

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,400
couple of verses from the book of Proverbs as really a springboard if you

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,839
will and then go look at a passage of scripture that we will deal with in more

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,319
detail but I want to start here in Proverbs chapter number 13 and this

16
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,919
evening if you're taking notes I've simply entitled the message choose your

17
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:29,919
companions wisely choose your companions wisely as we understand the

18
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:35,040
world in which we live we understand that there are many voices and there are

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,919
many ways in which we're influenced it's important I would say that it's

20
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:45,680
imperative that we would acknowledge this truth and then actively work to

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,839
ensure that we manage those influences the things that we hear the things that

22
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:56,040
we see the people that are influencing our lives there are many voices can I

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,400
tell you that we're engaged in spiritual battle warfare I've mentioned this many

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,040
times over the years but we understand the battle is raging we understand that

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,600
there are many that have an agenda there are many that are seeking to cause chaos

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,639
and confusion and that's the tactic of our enemy by the way our God is a God of

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,279
order the enemy is all about chaos and confusion and division we find that as

28
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,600
we look here and we think about those that are influencing us often we speak

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
about the importance of us actively being engaged in influencing others the

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,800
reality is that there are people that are influencing us as well and we

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,360
better be careful that we control that we manage how we're being influenced the

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000
sources of information that we're reading the places where we're hearing

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,039
certain things we need to be careful notice what the wise man says in

34
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:05,880
Proverbs 13 in verse number 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:15,199
a companion of fools shall be destroyed that's a powerful verse of Scripture I've

36
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,119
titled the message choose your companions wisely we need to be careful

37
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:24,440
who we associate with we see that in this particular verse of Scripture he

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,000
that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
destroyed look over at a New Testament verse of

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,399
Scripture keep your place there in the book of Proverbs if you will but look

41
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:47,919
over at the book of 1st Corinthians in chapter number 15 you know it's

42
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,759
interesting there are many pithy sayings if you will if we could use that

43
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,679
terminology that abound in our world and if you do some level of research and

44
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:03,279
study you'll find that many of them have a foundation upon some biblical truth

45
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:07,360
it's quite interesting when you do some of that studying and you've heard about

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,479
the whole good Apple bad Apple analogy and all of that sort of thing and we

47
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,760
find here in 1st Corinthians 15 and verse number 33 notice what it says be

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,200
not deceived now if a verse of Scripture starts out by saying be not deceived we

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,799
ought to pay attention we'll understand that the the writer of course we

50
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:32,239
understand the inspiration of the Scripture we understand that God is

51
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:39,880
seeking to give us some truth that no doubt it is possible shall I say common

52
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,079
that we would be deceived over the particular matter that is to be

53
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:53,200
discussed he says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners evil

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,200
communications corrupt good manners if I could give you just a brief overview of

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,119
some of that which is going on in the church in Corinth we understand this in

56
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:08,040
the 15th chapter near the end of the book but we understand as we do an

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,320
overview study as we do a detailed study through the book of 1st Corinthians that

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,040
the church in Corinth was a carnal church the church in Corinth was a

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,160
church that had divisions and all sorts of problems they were a carnal church

60
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,239
and the Apostle Paul said to them I can't really speak to you as unto

61
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:32,760
spiritual I got to speak to as carnal as babes and we find that as we go

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,720
through the book of 1st Corinthians and we'd study all that's going on and we

63
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,480
find that the Apostle Paul gives them many valuable truths in the first six

64
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,600
chapters and then he begins to answer questions that they shared with him he

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,320
begins chapter number seven speaking on this regard now concerning the things

66
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,239
that you've written they asked some questions about some things and really

67
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:58,640
if we begin to understand some of what's happening in Corinth and we'd

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,200
understand the wickedness in the city of Corinth and we'd understand some of

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,600
those things we would conclude that the church in Corinth was being influenced

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,720
by the culture it has always been the plan of God that his church influences

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,160
the culture not that the culture influences the church and we find that

72
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
in Corinth they had it backwards they were dealing with things where the

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,640
culture the society was influencing the church instead of the church

74
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:43,040
influencing the society or the culture I would say that in many regards today as

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,600
you look around the landscape of America you would find that there are many

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,959
churches that have been influenced by the culture that have been influenced by

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
the society that we live in when we are the ones that are to be influencing the

78
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
culture we're the light of the world the salt of the earth we have the truth of

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,799
the gospel and so we understand as we'd speak about the subject of choosing your

80
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,000
companions wisely that we have to be careful who we associate with notice

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,559
this as well that who and what we listen to notice what the Proverbs says the

82
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:30,799
wise man notes in Proverbs 19 in Proverbs chapter number 19 the things

83
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:39,839
that we listen to who and what we listen to it's an interesting process that you

84
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,320
should go through as you begin to listen to certain people it's a good thing to

85
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,799
do some research and find out what they really believe it's a good thing to find

86
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:55,399
out what their worldview is are they addressing subject matters from a

87
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,799
biblical worldview a biblical perspective or not you begin to just

88
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:05,320
hear some things I often have said that false teachers one of the things that's

89
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,540
so dangerous about false teachers is that they use our vocabulary but they

90
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,119
don't use our dictionary they'll say some of the same words that you've heard

91
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,480
though they'll use some of those catchwords but they mean something

92
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:26,119
entirely different because they use our vocabulary but not our dictionary and we

93
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:31,640
find that it's important for us to understand who and what we're listening

94
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,719
to and to ensure that we're not being adversely influenced by some that we

95
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:45,960
ought not be influenced by notice what Proverbs 1927 says cease my son to hear

96
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:55,280
the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge it is

97
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,320
possible that we could hear the instruction that would cause us to err

98
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,200
from the words of knowledge and so what is it that Solomon says cease my son

99
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,799
don't listen to that stuff don't be influenced by those things I mentioned

100
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:22,039
that there are many voices today and we see them we hear them I shall say loud

101
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,320
and clear I mean there's a lot of voices out there today and we got to be careful

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,039
on how we're being influenced consider this truth from the New Testament and

103
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,679
then we'll get to our passage that I want to dig into and really dissect

104
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,280
this evening but go to Philippians 4 we're familiar with the verse of

105
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:46,559
scripture in Philippians 4 in verse number 8 being familiar with the verse

106
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,840
does not mean that we practice the verse amen being familiar with the verse

107
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:01,119
doesn't mean we practice the verse finally brethren

108
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:04,839
Whatsoever things are true,

109
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,919
whatsoever things are honest,

110
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,919
whatsoever things are just,

111
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,039
whatsoever things are pure,

112
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,919
whatsoever things are lovely,

113
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,319
whatsoever things are of good report,

114
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,519
if there be any virtue,

115
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,719
and if there be any praise,

116
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:25,639
think on these things."

117
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,279
Alright, there's a filter test

118
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,679
that needs to be applied.

119
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,319
We begin to hear things.

120
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,759
We want to understand,

121
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,079
does it pass the Philippians 4.8 test?

122
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,919
Does this information that is being given to me,

123
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,039
that's being spoken to me,

124
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,239
or through some written means,

125
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:51,199
does it pass the test of Philippians 4.8?

126
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:54,599
It would be a good idea for us to practice that.

127
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,759
Putting the filter on. Amen?

128
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,039
God gave it to us for a reason.

129
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,919
Listen, you want to know what kind of things to think on?

130
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,679
These things.

131
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,839
Can I tell you that, really,

132
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,719
and I know I said this way early on

133
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,479
with the whole pandemic and everything that was going on,

134
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:16,679
so many listening to news and watching news,

135
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,359
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't have

136
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,559
any level of information,

137
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,559
but the reality is that

138
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,719
I gave somebody a formula,

139
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,679
I said for every 20 minutes that you watch or listen to the news,

140
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,799
you ought to spend an hour in the Bible.

141
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,279
I don't know where I got that percentage kind of situation,

142
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,799
I just came up with it,

143
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,519
but what I was trying to convey was that,

144
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,359
man, we need the truth of God's Word.

145
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:43,279
You sit around and you listen to these people all day long,

146
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
talking all their stuff that they're spewing out.

147
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,479
I sat in the hospital room one day,

148
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,799
visiting with someone,

149
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,999
and we actually had to be confined to the waiting room.

150
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,359
It used to be that you could go to a hospital

151
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,359
if someone was having surgery and you could wait for them,

152
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,359
you could go back there,

153
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:06,919
and I got these passes that basically let me go anywhere in the hospital

154
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,879
until COVID-19, I can't go anywhere near the hospital.

155
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,000
And of course, things are relaxing now,

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but it used to be that you could go in there

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,239
and as a pastor, I could go in and pray,

158
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,279
and I could wait and I could get in,

159
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,879
it didn't matter if it was visiting hours or not,

160
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,959
I had passes to be able to get in.

161
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,119
And I remember on one particular occasion,

162
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,319
someone's having a heart cath,

163
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:32,159
and I sat with the family there in the waiting room,

164
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,159
and there was this show on, I'm going to be honest with you,

165
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,720
I've never watched the show in its entirety,

166
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,679
but the show was called The View.

167
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,839
And it was on in the lobby,

168
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
and it was loud, and it was obnoxious,

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,919
and I wanted to throw something at the TV.

170
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,759
And I wasn't even watching it.

171
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,639
But the stuff that was spewing out of the mouths

172
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
of those people on that talk show was ridiculous.

173
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
And unfortunately, there were a whole host of people

174
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
that were sitting there watching it,

175
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,679
otherwise I would've just gone over and turned the thing off.

176
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,720
But it was loud, and it was obnoxious.

177
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,319
And we just overheard some of it.

178
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,479
Listen, some people that are listening

179
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,799
to that junk every single day, man, it's messing them up.

180
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,080
Amen?

181
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,199
Some people watching online

182
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,759
might send me some emails later, amen.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It'd be all good, amen.

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,199
It's the one thing that's interesting about online,

185
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,559
you never know who's watching, right?

186
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,479
And that's okay, I stand by it, amen.

187
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,360
It's junk.

188
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,239
And can I tell you that the networks are full of that stuff.

189
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,879
And you got these talking heads,

190
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,239
and you got these people,

191
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,399
and if we're not careful as to not only

192
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,839
who we associate with,

193
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,839
but also who and what we listen to,

194
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,720
how it influences us, how it affects us,

195
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,000
how it messes with our worldview.

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,319
And all of a sudden, we find ourselves saying some things

197
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,599
that we've actually never done any research on,

198
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,839
and we've never validated the truth of,

199
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,720
you know, and there are people

200
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
that say things that aren't true.

201
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,359
You know that?

202
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,160
Years ago, there was a commercial about the,

203
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,479
you know, how do you know that?

204
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,040
I read it on the internet,

205
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
and the idea of the commercial

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,559
was that everything on the internet is true.

207
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,239
You understand that's not true.

208
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,119
Just because you find it on the internet

209
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,279
doesn't mean it's true.

210
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,160
By the way, many of those search engine companies

211
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
run algorithms that put up search results

212
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,359
that they want to put up.

213
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I told you when I was preaching through the book of Genesis

214
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,799
and dealing with Noah's flood,

215
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,600
because we're still preaching through the book of Genesis,

216
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,839
it'll be a while,

217
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
but dealing with Noah's flood in particular,

218
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,679
you type in Noah's flood,

219
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,839
and you're gonna get a whole lot of stuff about it

220
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,559
being some fairy tale kind of a situation,

221
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,079
because the algorithms are written

222
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,239
to promote those things first.

223
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,559
Look at Psalm 1.

224
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,040
This is where I want to go this evening.

225
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Psalm chapter number one.

226
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,679
I believe the principles in mind from Proverbs 13 and 19

227
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,679
with regard to choosing your companions wisely,

228
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,079
I believe we see in the first three verses

229
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,239
of the first Psalm evidence of someone

230
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:38,079
that took the principles that we looked at

231
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
and lived by them.

232
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,160
Now, the reality is that many of us

233
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,000
are familiar with Psalm 1.

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,880
It's a very familiar passage of Scripture.

235
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,119
In fact, many of us have probably memorized the first Psalm,

236
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,720
and we could stand up and quote it,

237
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,239
and sometimes I fear that what happens

238
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,600
with a passage of Scripture

239
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,679
that has a high level of understanding

240
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,799
that we're extremely familiar with it

241
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,720
is that sometimes we can miss things,

242
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
because we simply, oh yeah, I know that.

243
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,000
I know that account.

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,239
I know that situation.

245
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,440
I know what happens.

246
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,720
And the reality is that,

247
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,440
especially if you've been saved for any length of time,

248
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,479
if you read your Bible regularly,

249
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:28,079
you must always be careful to keep it fresh.

250
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,839
What I mean by that is that we don't just get into autopilot.

251
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,359
That we ask the Lord, show me something,

252
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,199
teach me, minister to me.

253
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,359
And we have had the opportunity, personally speaking,

254
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,519
I've read passages of Scripture,

255
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,720
I've preached passages of Scripture

256
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,079
that I've gone back to weeks later,

257
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,679
months later, years later,

258
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,959
and I've read again,

259
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,199
and man, I didn't understand that before.

260
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,160
I didn't see that before.

261
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,320
And God's Word is a living book.

262
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,199
And we must not allow the holy to become common.

263
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,679
In Psalm 1, notice the Bible says,

264
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,079
blessed is the man that walketh not

265
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,559
in the counsel of the ungodly,

266
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,199
nor standeth in the way of sinners,

267
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,880
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

268
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,320
Notice it says, but,

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,399
his delight is in the law of the Lord,

270
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:28,279
and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

271
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,160
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water

272
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.

273
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,000
His leaf also shall not wither,

274
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,600
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

275
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,959
Just gonna look at the first three verses this evening.

276
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,239
If you're taking notes, number one,

277
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,440
I want you to notice how this man acts.

278
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,760
Notice how he acts.

279
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,279
We often would look at this as being the blessed man.

280
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,959
Blessed is the man.

281
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,079
And I want you to notice two things

282
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,919
with regard to what God tells us,

283
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,639
with regard to his action from verses one and two.

284
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,799
Number one, if I could summarize verse number one,

285
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,760
I would summarize it this way.

286
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,079
Get out of the world.

287
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,079
Just get out of the world.

288
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,440
We are in the world, but we are not of the world.

289
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,919
Isn't that what Jesus said in John 17?

290
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,679
That's what he said.

291
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,880
And the reality is that if you read John 17,

292
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,440
and by the way, that's the Lord's Prayer,

293
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,639
you understand that as he's going through there,

294
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,679
and as he's praying, notice this,

295
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,679
he says in verse number 15,

296
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,559
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,

297
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:46,159
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

298
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,919
You know what that means?

299
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,839
There's evil.

300
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,559
Amen?

301
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,599
We live in an evil world.

302
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,080
And it says, Jesus, he says,

303
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm not praying that you should take them out of the world,

304
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:03,119
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

305
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,479
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

306
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,400
Sanctify them through thy Word.

307
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,719
Thy Word is truth.

308
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,000
And so we find as we look at verse number one

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,479
and summarize the thought of verse number one,

310
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:20,119
it would simply be this, get out of the world.

311
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,760
Get out of the world.

312
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,679
Stop allowing the world to influence you.

313
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
Look at what the Bible says.

314
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,520
Blessed is the man.

315
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,760
Look at the progression.

316
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Number one, that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.

317
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,799
He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.

318
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,719
He's understanding that there's some influences,

319
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,559
there's some counsel.

320
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,400
He's not gonna walk in that direction.

321
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,640
It's interesting as you begin to see the progression

322
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
of the verse of Scripture,

323
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,559
that the Bible says that he walketh not

324
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,080
in the counsel of the ungodly.

325
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Notice number two, nor standeth in the way of sinners.

326
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,560
You start walking in that way.

327
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,360
Before long, you start standing amongst them.

328
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,960
You've been walking,

329
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
and now you're standing,

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
and you're getting more influence.

331
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,600
You're hearing more.

332
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,680
More of that world is being put on you

333
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,600
and the thoughts of the world.

334
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,520
And we find, listen, the enemy...

335
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,960
Something about Satan.

336
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,840
He's a liar.

337
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,040
He's a liar. Right?

338
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,800
So you think that as a liar

339
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,680
and as a deceiver,

340
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,280
he's going to package that thing

341
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,520
as well as he possibly can.

342
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,360
And what happens here is we find

343
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,280
the Bible says,

344
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,960
"...blessed is the man that walketh not

345
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
in the counsel of the ungodly,

346
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,160
nor standeth in the way of sinners..."

347
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,800
Then notice this progression.

348
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
"...nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."

349
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,320
So from walking, to standing, to sitting.

350
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,800
You think about Lot.

351
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Lot and Abraham have a discussion.

352
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,280
There was some contention among their herdsmen.

353
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Right?

354
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,200
Choose the land. What does Lot do?

355
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
He sees it.

356
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,000
He says, I want that land.

357
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,320
Initially, he just pitches his tent toward Sodom.

358
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,760
Before long, he's living in Sodom.

359
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,920
Before long, he's sitting at the gate.

360
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,720
He lost his family.

361
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,200
The Bible says in the New Testament

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,640
that this righteous man vexed his righteous soul.

363
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Can you imagine?

364
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,880
How'd that happen?

365
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
You just start facing the wrong direction.

366
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,040
You just start walking with the ungodly.

367
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,640
You start standing and hearing

368
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,880
and being influenced.

369
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Sitting in the seat of the scornful.

370
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,680
I think about the way in which,

371
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,960
and I won't read the quote to you this evening.

372
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
I've read it before.

373
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,200
If you'd like to have it,

374
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,680
I'll be glad to send it to you.

375
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,800
But the reality is that the enemy

376
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,800
has taken our classrooms in America

377
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,920
to use them as a platform

378
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,040
to promote their agenda.

379
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,680
It's a known fact

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,760
that they're seeking to promote their agenda.

381
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,360
The Darwinian evolution, the humanism,

382
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
and all of the things that are going on.

383
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
And we find that in the classrooms

384
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
across America,

385
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,680
this stuff is being taught.

386
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,160
We find here the blessed man.

387
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,440
We notice how he acts.

388
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,120
Number one, get out of the world.

389
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,160
Don't allow those things to influence you.

390
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,440
Be careful.

391
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
Remember, choose your companions wisely.

392
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,120
Understand the truth of influence.

393
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,480
Get out of the world, but number two,

394
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,000
get into the Word.

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,040
Get into the Word.

396
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,120
I read already in John 17,

397
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,920
he talked about the fact that

398
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,160
he's praying not that we'd be delivered from the world,

399
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,080
that we're in the world,

400
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,320
but we're not of the world.

401
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,000
And then he says,

402
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,520
sanctify them through Thy Word.

403
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,800
Thy Word is truth.

404
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,880
So we get out of the world,

405
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,800
but we must get into the Word.

406
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,080
Notice the actions in verse 2.

407
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,440
There's this contrast as the verse begins

408
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
with the word,

409
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,920
but His delight is in the law of the Lord.

410
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
That word delight carries with it

411
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,760
the idea of taking pleasure in.

412
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,480
If reading the Bible is a chore,

413
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,280
if reading the Bible is a checkmark

414
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
on a book somewhere,

415
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,760
if that's reading the Bible,

416
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,120
if that's kind of the approach,

417
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,600
that's not really delighting in the law of the Lord.

418
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,120
Delighting in the law of the Lord is when,

419
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,600
so let me use this maybe simple analogy.

420
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,640
There are certain foods that perhaps you eat

421
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,920
because they're good for you.

422
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Some of those green vegetables.

423
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
My dad always, as a child,

424
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,040
as I would have and I never ate them

425
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,000
and to this day, I don't eat them.

426
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,800
My mom likes them.

427
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,040
Beets.

428
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,600
I think they taste like dirt.

429
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,280
If you like beets, that's up to you.

430
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,680
That's fine.

431
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,880
I just don't like them.

432
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,960
And my dad would cut those things up on his plate

433
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,600
and he'd say, oh, these are so good.

434
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,480
And he was lying every second of the way.

435
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
He's just eating them because supposedly

436
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,320
there's some benefit of eating them.

437
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,360
There are other things,

438
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,640
cheese steaks, cheeseburgers, pizza,

439
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
you know, all that kind of stuff,

440
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,400
like I don't have to force myself to eat it, right?

441
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,080
Like it's just good.

442
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,200
Somebody mentioned to me today

443
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,520
about eating Brussels sprouts.

444
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,840
Ugh, Holly likes those things.

445
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,920
I can't stand them.

446
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,800
Dean's ready to go eat, amen?

447
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,120
But what I'm saying is that

448
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,200
when I look at the way in which the terminology is used,

449
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,280
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,

450
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,800
it's not this thing of I have to read my Bible.

451
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,360
It's not this thing of let me make sure

452
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
I check this box because I want to read.

453
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,880
No, no, I'm delighting in it.

454
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,200
This is God speaking to me.

455
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,840
God's love letter, if I could use that analogy

456
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,480
to us as His people.

457
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,080
Listen, there was never a time that Holly,

458
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,440
when we were dating,

459
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,560
would give me a note or a letter

460
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,000
that I was not anxious to read.

461
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,200
I'm being honest.

462
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,160
She'd leave a note in my box in college,

463
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
and it didn't matter if I was running

464
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,640
a little bit late to class or whatever.

465
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I want to read it.

466
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,720
I want to know the content of it.

467
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,000
I never just kind of tucked it away somewhere

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,880
and well, I'll see what that says later.

469
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,920
No, it was never my,

470
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,720
it just wasn't.

471
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,680
You guys remember when you were dating?

472
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
See, today they got all this technology, right?

473
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,440
We used to actually write notes

474
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,200
like on paper with pen.

475
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,920
Imagine that, right?

476
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,600
And you were anxious to read it.

477
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,280
And there were times in which

478
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,920
maybe I was going to go on a trip.

479
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,120
I remember going to a national preaching conference

480
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,840
down in North Carolina and we were dating

481
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,880
and she gave me some notes and she said,

482
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,760
now don't read them until...

483
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,840
What do you think you want to do?

484
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,320
Armando, you want to read it, right?

485
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,880
Because this is from the person that I love,

486
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,840
the person that I'm planning to marry.

487
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,120
This is a love note.

488
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,200
Amen?

489
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
This is God's Word.

490
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
God loves us.

491
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,400
And He gave us this book.

492
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,520
And we ought to delight in the law of the Lord.

493
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Oh man, I get to read my Bible.

494
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,400
It's not a chore, it's a delight.

495
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
In times in which we're reading our Bible

496
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,080
and say, man, I can't believe that much time went by.

497
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
I understand we have other things to do in life.

498
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,520
I understand we have jobs

499
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
and various things that we have to tend to

500
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
and kids that are running around

501
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,280
that need some breakfast.

502
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,720
And I get it, right? I understand.

503
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
What I'm saying is that

504
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,000
the picture that we get here

505
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,200
of this delighting in the law of the Lord

506
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,560
is taking pleasure in it.

507
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,880
I can't wait until I can read my Bible.

508
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
If you're morning,

509
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,920
I personally like to read in the morning

510
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,760
after I have my coffee.

511
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,000
Holly likes to read in the morning

512
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,680
as soon as her eyeballs open up.

513
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,280
I'd close my eyeballs and go back to sleep.

514
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,080
So I don't do it that way.

515
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,840
I like to get some coffee and I like to read.

516
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,480
Occasionally, something happens.

517
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,640
Somebody's in the hospital.

518
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,160
Something weird happens.

519
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,480
And your time with God gets interrupted.

520
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
You're a mom and a child wakes up

521
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,720
before they're supposed to.

522
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,200
Whatever it might be.

523
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,120
For me, that time got interrupted.

524
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,880
I can't wait until I can get back

525
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,720
to my time with God.

526
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,559
My delight in the law of the Lord.

527
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm not patting myself on the back.

528
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,119
I'm just simply saying,

529
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,760
when we look at the imagery

530
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,600
that is given to us,

531
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,160
when we understand what's taking place,

532
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,280
listen, if you can watch some news network

533
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,239
longer than you can read God's Word,

534
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:52,520
we need to do some examination.

535
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,119
Amen?

536
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:57,080
Let's just be transparent with one another.

537
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,080
If we can watch the news for a couple hours a day,

538
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,280
but we can only read the Bible

539
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,880
for a few minutes a day,

540
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,559
not only is there a problem,

541
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,400
but there's going to be greater problems.

542
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,880
His delight is in the law of the Lord.

543
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,239
Look at what it says.

544
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,040
And in His law,

545
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,400
doth He meditate day and night.

546
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,440
No doubt, as we look at this passage of Scripture

547
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,760
and we consider the actions of this blessed man

548
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:32,119
and we see that he's getting out of the world

549
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,679
and he's getting into the Word,

550
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,960
we find that he's meditating

551
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,360
to dwell on anything in thought,

552
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,520
to muse upon it.

553
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Throughout the Psalms, you'll see

554
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
that little word often used,

555
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,799
selah.

556
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,920
It's good for us to meditate on the Word of God.

557
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,559
It's good for us to just let the Word of God

558
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,280
just be in our minds and stew over it

559
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,080
and just saturate our minds.

560
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,720
He combines our souls with the Word of God.

561
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,360
It says day and night.

562
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,160
No doubt in my mind that here in Psalm 1,

563
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,520
there's some connection to the truth in Joshua 1.

564
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
I preached a message on this

565
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,720
as we went through the series early on

566
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,600
in the book of Joshua.

567
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,260
Joshua 1 and verse 8.

568
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,720
When God says to Joshua,

569
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,080
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,

570
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,040
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night.

571
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,680
Why? Why, Joshua, should you meditate in this law,

572
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,960
in this book of the law day and night?

573
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,760
That thou mayest observe to do according to all

574
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,200
that is written therein.

575
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,200
For then, then is after, right?

576
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,400
For then, thou shalt make thy way prosperous,

577
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,280
and then, thou shalt have good success.

578
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,800
I made the statement this morning

579
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
that oftentimes we want the result

580
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,600
without the process.

581
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,840
We want the then, but we don't want the process.

582
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,800
We want to have our way being prosperous.

583
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,520
We want the good success,

584
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,240
but we might not want to follow

585
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,840
the instruction that is given.

586
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,560
And I find here that the Word of God

587
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,600
is the delight of this man,

588
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,160
and not only does he take pleasure in it

589
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,200
and have it as being his delight,

590
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,160
but the Bible says that he meditates in it

591
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,080
day and night.

592
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
Day and night.

593
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
Think about that.

594
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,280
Really, the idea is we're meditating day and night,

595
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,520
that throughout the day,

596
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,960
the truth of that which I have read

597
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,920
is on my mind.

598
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,800
I wonder how often,

599
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,400
as we read our Bibles in the morning,

600
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,320
I wonder how often we think about

601
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,920
what we read as we go throughout the day.

602
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,520
It's really on our mind.

603
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,800
Like we're really meditating on it.

604
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,920
It's really affecting our behavior that day.

605
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,200
That we really ask the question,

606
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,720
how is it that what I read today

607
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,000
can be put in practice in my life today?

608
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We find that the first two verses of Psalm 1,

609
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,160
we note how he acts.

610
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,240
In verse number 3 of Psalm 1,

611
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
we note how he abounds.

612
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,240
Notice what the Bible says,

613
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,680
and he shall be.

614
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,920
Like, there's an analogy that is given to us,

615
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,680
a picture that is describing

616
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,040
the way in which this man

617
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,400
that is the blessed man,

618
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
how he will abound.

619
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,520
He shall be, notice,

620
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,840
like a tree planted by the rivers of water.

621
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,160
In your mind, no doubt,

622
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,400
as you think about the imagery that is given

623
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,640
in verse number 3 of Psalm 1,

624
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,320
we have the image of strength and stability

625
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,040
as this tree that is planted

626
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,800
by the rivers of water.

627
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,520
This tree that as we go through

628
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
the progression of verse number 3,

629
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
we'll understand that it flourishes.

630
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,920
We understand that it's fruitful

631
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,080
and so on and so forth.

632
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,880
But we get that picture immediately

633
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,480
of some stability and some strength.

634
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,800
Remember as we started that series

635
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,040
and we didn't get very far into the series

636
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,200
in the book of Titus,

637
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
and we titled our series in the book of Titus

638
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,680
Grounded and Settled.

639
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,640
And the reason really the thought

640
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,680
of the book of Titus

641
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,240
and what Titus was commissioned to do there

642
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,200
in Crete is he would go and ordain

643
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,920
and set in order the things that were wanting.

644
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,520
And we understand all that he was responsible for doing.

645
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,680
And we get this picture of being

646
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,800
grounded and settled.

647
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,200
The Bible tells us in Colossians 1

648
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
and verse number 23,

649
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,680
if you continue in the faith,

650
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,000
grounded and settled,

651
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,840
and be not moved away from the hope

652
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,760
of the Gospel which ye have heard

653
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,360
and which was preached to every creature

654
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
which is under heaven,

655
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,240
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister.

656
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,160
And we see here in this picture

657
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,040
in verse number 3,

658
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,680
this tree that's planted by the rivers of water,

659
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,040
this strength and stability.

660
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,160
But the Bible doesn't end there.

661
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,480
The Bible says this in verse number 3,

662
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,840
that bringeth forth His fruit,

663
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
and then notice this,

664
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,600
in His season.

665
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,240
You know that fruit trees have seasons.

666
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,880
And we would see here

667
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,000
that the understanding as we would begin

668
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,200
to see what's happening,

669
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,320
that bringeth forth His fruit in His season,

670
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,480
that it's not only fruitful,

671
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,040
but it's at the right time.

672
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
The reality is that there's some times

673
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,080
that we're not on the same time schedule

674
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,800
that God's on,

675
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,520
but it's our time schedule that's wrong,

676
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,960
not God's.

677
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,360
Because God's time schedule's perfect.

678
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,560
And the reality is that we look here

679
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,640
and we see this One that is referred to

680
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,120
as blessed as the man,

681
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,880
and we see His actions, His behavior.

682
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,800
He's getting out of the world.

683
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,440
He's getting into the Word.

684
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,240
And we know how He abounds.

685
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,320
He's like a tree.

686
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,880
The strength and the stability.

687
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,520
But He's fruitful.

688
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
And He's fruitful in His season

689
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
at the right time.

690
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,040
We find that the Bible then makes this statement,

691
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,120
His leaf also shall not wither.

692
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,400
It's interesting.

693
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
If you were to think about the area

694
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,160
in which the psalmist lived.

695
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,880
You would think about the terrain.

696
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,560
Now, I've never been to Israel.

697
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,720
I've seen some pictures.

698
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,240
I know many people that have,

699
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,680
and I hope one day to be able to get there.

700
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,880
If I don't get there,

701
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,600
I'll see the New Jerusalem at least.

702
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,440
Amen.

703
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,880
And the reality, however,

704
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,480
is that if you do a little study

705
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,600
and what have you,

706
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,880
you could find out

707
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,520
that as you look at the imagery

708
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
of verse number three,

709
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,600
this tree that's planted by the rivers of water

710
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,400
and how important that is

711
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,160
for the sustainability of trees

712
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,880
in that particular region.

713
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,520
And as you would deal with periods of drought

714
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
and not having water,

715
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
and you could see how because of the heat

716
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,960
and because of all of those things,

717
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,840
you could see some leaves that wither.

718
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,840
Some leaves that wither.

719
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,560
See, why is it that His leaf also shall not wither?

720
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,040
Well, if I could use the analogy

721
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,240
that He's plugged into the right source, right?

722
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,680
He's gotten out of the world,

723
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
He's gotten into the Word,

724
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,080
and He's receiving that sustenance spiritually

725
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,600
from the Lord through His Word,

726
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,840
and we begin to see how He abounds

727
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,560
and we begin to see the way

728
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,840
in which this is described for us

729
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,040
in verse number three.

730
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,760
And really, we're getting a good picture.

731
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,640
I mean, this is a positive thing.

732
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,240
This is a result that is desired.

733
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Amen?

734
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,720
And then it ends in verse number three

735
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,720
with whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

736
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

737
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,760
Oh, so you mean I can do whatever I want to do

738
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
and I'm going to prosper?

739
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,600
No, no, no, no.

740
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
You missed all of the message.

741
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,920
You missed it all.

742
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,160
Because what we're going to do

743
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
is we're going to do what we have found

744
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,240
that God wants us to do.

745
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,840
And when we're doing what God wants us to do,

746
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,560
then God is going to bless that effort and that work,

747
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,360
and we might not be prosperous

748
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,880
from a world's perspective,

749
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,720
but we must understand that God's definition

750
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,240
of prosperity and success differs greatly

751
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,040
than the definition of the world.

752
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,160
There are some that have this idea

753
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,600
that I'm a success if I end my life

754
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,480
with a certain amount of money

755
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,720
and a certain amount of goods

756
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
and all of these sort of things.

757
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,200
The reality is a child of God.

758
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,239
I'm just wanting to hear,

759
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,040
well done, thou good and faithful servant.

760
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,600
Amen?

761
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
See, many people,

762
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,640
as we look to the truth of the Word of God

763
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,360
and we understand what God's Word has told us

764
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,360
and we find here that He says,

765
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,200
whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

766
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,960
When I'm getting out of the world,

767
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,360
when I'm getting into the Word

768
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,000
and I'm delighting in the Word

769
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
and I'm meditating on the Word

770
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,880
and I'm no doubt because of those actions,

771
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,679
I'm obeying God and I'm following God's plan,

772
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,000
this blessed result of verse number three

773
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,640
is evident in my life

774
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,840
and we begin to see God working.

775
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,119
Psalm 37,

776
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
the Bible says trust in the Lord

777
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,000
in verse number three and do good.

778
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,720
So shalt thou dwell in the land

779
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:34,200
and verily thou shalt be fed.

780
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,799
Notice this,

781
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:39,200
delight thyself also in the Lord

782
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,600
and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

783
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,200
How many of you have ever heard a child of God say,

784
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,920
God said He'll give me the desires of my heart

785
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,360
and they forgot the whole first part of the verse?

786
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
Right?

787
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
God didn't just say,

788
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
I'll give you the desires of your heart.

789
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,280
heart. He said, delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of

790
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,760
thy heart. Notice thine heart. Notice verse five. Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust

791
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:21,760
also in him and he shall bring it to pass. See, when I delight myself in the Lord, here's

792
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:32,480
what happens. His desires become my desires. And if his desires are my desires, then guess

793
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,920
what? He's going to give me the desires of mine heart. Why? Because they're his desires.

794
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,960
Does that make sense? And so often we've taken things and we've pulled and we've picked and

795
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,640
we've taken and we've come to a completely different conclusion. We've got people running

796
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,520
around doing their own thing, doing whatever they want to do and saying, well, God said

797
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,960
he's going to bless me. What is your description of blessing? Just because you have a good

798
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:09,040
salary doesn't mean God's blessing you. In America, we look at it that way sometimes.

799
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:17,920
Biblically speaking, that is not in any way, shape or form the reality of whether God's

800
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,200
blessing someone or not. God promised to provide for us and I'm thankful he does.

801
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:31,120
Most of us have probably, at least not in recent years, have had to pray for our daily

802
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:40,160
bread. God's been good to us in this nation. I mean, he's been real good to us. And if

803
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:50,400
we're not careful in kind of promoting some of those ideas, we'd have a hard time being

804
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,040
able to take that same type of teaching to some of these other third world countries

805
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:04,160
around the world where, by the way, the Word of God works and is truth. Right? This thing

806
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:11,680
of the prosperity gospel and all these things that are promoted, it's not biblical. I'm

807
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,919
thankful that God chooses to bless and that God chooses to bless some with wealth and

808
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:22,200
that's perfectly fine. I'm not opposed to it whatsoever. But we have to understand that

809
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,480
as we look here in the passage of scripture in Psalm chapter number one, and we kind of

810
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,720
bring full circle back to our thought this evening of choosing your companions wisely.

811
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,680
Listen, if we're not careful this evening, we're going to be influenced by some people

812
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,840
in our world. We're going to be influenced by some things that we're hearing and we're

813
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,000
reading and it's going to cause us to go on a path completely different than what this

814
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,600
book teaches. And we have to understand that there is a battle that is raging and there

815
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:00,360
are many voices out there. As I thought about that truth of many voices being out there

816
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,279
and understanding what's happening in our world today with all of these negative influences

817
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:13,360
and all of these people that are teaching this teaching that is foreign to the truth

818
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,520
of the Word of God. And we find that we'd ask ourselves, see, there are times that people

819
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,240
come that grew up in a church and they come and they say something like this. Well, I

820
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:30,680
just don't believe that anymore. What changed? What happened? I've had the opportunity on

821
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,840
a few occasions to actually sit down and talk to some people and find out, do a little digging

822
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:46,639
and find out what happened. One man in particular, I remember like it was yesterday, I knocked

823
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:52,480
on his door. It was a Saturday morning. And I began to speak to him about the Lord. Somebody

824
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,960
is grilling. It smells good. Amen. Somebody smell that? Yeah, you better shut that door.

825
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:09,240
Amen. Or bring some over. The man that answered the door began to just exchange some simple

826
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:17,080
conversation. I told him who I was, where I was from and so on and so forth. And I asked

827
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:29,200
him if he was sure if he or did I go to heaven. He kind of chuckled. Can't know that. I began

828
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,360
to quote some verses of Scripture to him. And I'll never forget when I quoted John 14

829
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:42,760
verse number six, I said, Sir, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and he said, and the life. No

830
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,640
man cometh unto the Father, but by me. He said it. He finished the verse. It kind of took me back.

831
00:44:49,640 --> 00:45:01,399
Okay, this guy, he knows some stuff. We had an extended conversation. And through that

832
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:06,959
conversation, I found out how he grew up, the church that he grew up in, what he had been

833
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:20,520
taught, etc, etc. I said, man, what happened? He told me where he went to college. I had some

834
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:29,000
understanding of the university that he went to, and some of the secular influence that he would

835
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,920
be exposed to at that particular school. I didn't have a ton of information on that, but I did have

836
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,760
some understanding of it. And I began to inquire. So what happened? Well, I sat in this class and

837
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:50,640
began to name these classes that he sat in, and how that the professor systematically tore apart

838
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:59,679
his worldview and presented him with some other perspective than this perspective, and how it just

839
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:08,640
totally destroyed his faith. It was sad. I had the opportunity to meet with that man probably four or

840
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:17,640
five times over the course of maybe four months. And it did not matter what verse of Scripture I

841
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:26,040
went to, it didn't matter what I said to this man, he was in fully with that ideology. And it was so sad.

842
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:36,679
I had thoughts, probably not the same way I think I'm now, with regard to how his parents must have

843
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:47,040
felt, how his pastor must have felt from when he was a young child. I'm not suggesting that we can

844
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:54,600
force anybody to have a certain worldview or what have you, but the reality is that that person made a

845
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:04,839
decision to be influenced by some that had a completely different worldview. And unfortunately, they did not

846
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:15,720
have a firm enough grounding themselves to be able to withstand that. That's not the truth for everyone.

847
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,360
There are some people that can go to some places and read some things, and they have enough spiritual

848
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:32,880
foundation that they can handle it. But you better be careful. You better be careful. Apologetics is such an

849
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:40,959
important truth, an area of study of being able to defend the truth and contend for the faith that's been

850
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:52,040
delivered. And we find that there are many influences. And we have to be careful of who we associate with. We

851
00:47:52,040 --> 00:48:02,000
have to be careful of who and what we listen to. Because before long, we hear enough of that stuff. And it's just, I

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:13,600
mean, it is just permeating our society. I mean, the young children are being set in front of TVs that are showing

853
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:25,399
programs that are indoctrinating them as toddlers. It's happening. And then we wonder why they don't believe, why they

854
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:33,799
fall away, why this happens and why that happens. Oh, we need to be careful. We need to be careful that we protect, that we

855
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:45,320
manage how we're being influenced. And it would be a good exercise for us to not only know Philippians 4.8, but to

856
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:54,919
exercise Philippians 4.8. And so I'm going to put this in practice in my life. I'm going to be careful. And I am going to

857
00:48:54,919 --> 00:49:08,160
protect how I'm being influenced. And I'm going to get out of the world purposefully. And I am going to get into the Word. And

858
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,720
we better have right proportions. We better understand how important it is. And sometimes we can say, well, I just want to be

859
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:26,280
informed. Be careful. Be careful who you're listening to. Be careful how that stuff is affecting you. And we have the truth of God's

860
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:37,320
Word and how powerful it is to transform our lives and to give us all the answers that we need for life. Lord, we love you. We thank you

861
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:46,039
for loving us. We thank you for the counsel of the wise man here in Proverbs, both in chapter 13 and 19, as we've used these

862
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:54,760
verses as a starting point to get there to the blessed man in Psalm 1. God, we're thankful for the opportunity to observe his

863
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,599
action and then to see how he abounds. God, I pray that you would help us this evening.

864
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:09,839
Lord, there are so many pieces of information that are so readily available to us.

865
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,359
Most today have technology at their fingertips.

866
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,439
We can look up anything, we get alerts all the time, we're being influenced by so many

867
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:18,919
different areas.

868
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:26,159
God, I pray that you would help us to manage how we're being influenced, who we're being

869
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:28,599
influenced by.

870
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:36,079
Lord, help us to get out of the world and to get into thy word.

871
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,679
We thank you for the power of your word.

872
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:48,019
Lord, I pray that you would help us to think and behave biblically.

873
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:52,119
Help us to be grounded and settled.

874
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,359
Work in our hearts and lives and we'll thank you for it.

875
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,679
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

876
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,679
Would you stand with me?

877
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,719
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

878
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,659
Maybe this evening there are some things that you've been exposed to that are influences

879
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,279
that you need to repent of, let's just be honest.

880
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:18,639
Maybe this evening you just want to pray and ask God to help you to be aware of the influencing

881
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:25,879
that is taking place and that God would help you to be protected from being adversely influenced.

882
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,599
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
