WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
week is the better way to put that and they indicated that here's how I feel

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:12.000
when I'm in church and it's cold and it was a group text message and Holly

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.760
promptly responded back with a an emoji of a sweaty person saying and

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.479
this is how pastor feels when he's preaching and I was quite comical and I

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.959
have said for years I do not set the thermostat to what it would cause me to

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:34.639
be comfortable because all of you would be very much freezing and I said it to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:39.880
try to accommodate as many within the middle group as I can you don't want my

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.200
dad controlling the thermostat that's for sure and it will be freezing and so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.560
anyhow it is not helpful having all these windows and doors open but we

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.279
understand to increase some airflow and so Lord willing we won't have to do that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:01:00.639
too much longer Proverbs chapter number 13 this evening I'm going to tell you

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.880
right from the beginning we're not going to be here long I'm going to use a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.400
couple of verses from the book of Proverbs as really a springboard if you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.839
will and then go look at a passage of scripture that we will deal with in more

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:17.319
detail but I want to start here in Proverbs chapter number 13 and this

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.919
evening if you're taking notes I've simply entitled the message choose your

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:29.919
companions wisely choose your companions wisely as we understand the

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:35.040
world in which we live we understand that there are many voices and there are

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.919
many ways in which we're influenced it's important I would say that it's

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:45.680
imperative that we would acknowledge this truth and then actively work to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.839
ensure that we manage those influences the things that we hear the things that

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:56.040
we see the people that are influencing our lives there are many voices can I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.400
tell you that we're engaged in spiritual battle warfare I've mentioned this many

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.040
times over the years but we understand the battle is raging we understand that

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.600
there are many that have an agenda there are many that are seeking to cause chaos

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.639
and confusion and that's the tactic of our enemy by the way our God is a God of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.279
order the enemy is all about chaos and confusion and division we find that as

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.600
we look here and we think about those that are influencing us often we speak

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.600
about the importance of us actively being engaged in influencing others the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.800
reality is that there are people that are influencing us as well and we

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.360
better be careful that we control that we manage how we're being influenced the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.000
sources of information that we're reading the places where we're hearing

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.039
certain things we need to be careful notice what the wise man says in

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:05.880
Proverbs 13 in verse number 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:15.199
a companion of fools shall be destroyed that's a powerful verse of Scripture I've

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.119
titled the message choose your companions wisely we need to be careful

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:24.440
who we associate with we see that in this particular verse of Scripture he

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:33.000
that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
destroyed look over at a New Testament verse of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.399
Scripture keep your place there in the book of Proverbs if you will but look

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:47.919
over at the book of 1st Corinthians in chapter number 15 you know it's

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.759
interesting there are many pithy sayings if you will if we could use that

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:57.679
terminology that abound in our world and if you do some level of research and

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:03.279
study you'll find that many of them have a foundation upon some biblical truth

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.360
it's quite interesting when you do some of that studying and you've heard about

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.479
the whole good Apple bad Apple analogy and all of that sort of thing and we

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.760
find here in 1st Corinthians 15 and verse number 33 notice what it says be

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.200
not deceived now if a verse of Scripture starts out by saying be not deceived we

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.799
ought to pay attention we'll understand that the the writer of course we

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:32.239
understand the inspiration of the Scripture we understand that God is

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:39.880
seeking to give us some truth that no doubt it is possible shall I say common

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.079
that we would be deceived over the particular matter that is to be

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:53.200
discussed he says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners evil

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.200
communications corrupt good manners if I could give you just a brief overview of

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.119
some of that which is going on in the church in Corinth we understand this in

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:08.040
the 15th chapter near the end of the book but we understand as we do an

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.320
overview study as we do a detailed study through the book of 1st Corinthians that

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.040
the church in Corinth was a carnal church the church in Corinth was a

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.160
church that had divisions and all sorts of problems they were a carnal church

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.239
and the Apostle Paul said to them I can't really speak to you as unto

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:32.760
spiritual I got to speak to as carnal as babes and we find that as we go

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.720
through the book of 1st Corinthians and we'd study all that's going on and we

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.480
find that the Apostle Paul gives them many valuable truths in the first six

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.600
chapters and then he begins to answer questions that they shared with him he

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.320
begins chapter number seven speaking on this regard now concerning the things

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.239
that you've written they asked some questions about some things and really

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:58.640
if we begin to understand some of what's happening in Corinth and we'd

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.200
understand the wickedness in the city of Corinth and we'd understand some of

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.600
those things we would conclude that the church in Corinth was being influenced

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.720
by the culture it has always been the plan of God that his church influences

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.160
the culture not that the culture influences the church and we find that

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.720
in Corinth they had it backwards they were dealing with things where the

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.640
culture the society was influencing the church instead of the church

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:43.040
influencing the society or the culture I would say that in many regards today as

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.600
you look around the landscape of America you would find that there are many

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.959
churches that have been influenced by the culture that have been influenced by

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.440
the society that we live in when we are the ones that are to be influencing the

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.000
culture we're the light of the world the salt of the earth we have the truth of

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.799
the gospel and so we understand as we'd speak about the subject of choosing your

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:13.000
companions wisely that we have to be careful who we associate with notice

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.559
this as well that who and what we listen to notice what the Proverbs says the

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:30.799
wise man notes in Proverbs 19 in Proverbs chapter number 19 the things

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:39.839
that we listen to who and what we listen to it's an interesting process that you

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:45.320
should go through as you begin to listen to certain people it's a good thing to

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.799
do some research and find out what they really believe it's a good thing to find

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:55.399
out what their worldview is are they addressing subject matters from a

00:07:55.399 --> 00:08:00.799
biblical worldview a biblical perspective or not you begin to just

00:08:00.799 --> 00:08:05.320
hear some things I often have said that false teachers one of the things that's

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.540
so dangerous about false teachers is that they use our vocabulary but they

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.119
don't use our dictionary they'll say some of the same words that you've heard

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:18.480
though they'll use some of those catchwords but they mean something

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:26.119
entirely different because they use our vocabulary but not our dictionary and we

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:31.640
find that it's important for us to understand who and what we're listening

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.719
to and to ensure that we're not being adversely influenced by some that we

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:45.960
ought not be influenced by notice what Proverbs 1927 says cease my son to hear

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:55.280
the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge it is

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.320
possible that we could hear the instruction that would cause us to err

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.200
from the words of knowledge and so what is it that Solomon says cease my son

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.799
don't listen to that stuff don't be influenced by those things I mentioned

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:22.039
that there are many voices today and we see them we hear them I shall say loud

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:27.320
and clear I mean there's a lot of voices out there today and we got to be careful

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.039
on how we're being influenced consider this truth from the New Testament and

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:34.679
then we'll get to our passage that I want to dig into and really dissect

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.280
this evening but go to Philippians 4 we're familiar with the verse of

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:46.559
scripture in Philippians 4 in verse number 8 being familiar with the verse

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:53.840
does not mean that we practice the verse amen being familiar with the verse

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:01.119
doesn't mean we practice the verse finally brethren

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:04.839
Whatsoever things are true,

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:06.919
whatsoever things are honest,

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.919
whatsoever things are just,

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:11.039
whatsoever things are pure,

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.919
whatsoever things are lovely,

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:15.319
whatsoever things are of good report,

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:17.519
if there be any virtue,

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.719
and if there be any praise,

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:25.639
think on these things."

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.279
Alright, there's a filter test

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.679
that needs to be applied.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.319
We begin to hear things.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:33.759
We want to understand,

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:38.079
does it pass the Philippians 4.8 test?

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:42.919
Does this information that is being given to me,

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:45.039
that's being spoken to me,

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.239
or through some written means,

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:51.199
does it pass the test of Philippians 4.8?

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:54.599
It would be a good idea for us to practice that.

00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:57.759
Putting the filter on. Amen?

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:00.039
God gave it to us for a reason.

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:03.919
Listen, you want to know what kind of things to think on?

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.679
These things.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.839
Can I tell you that, really,

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:10.719
and I know I said this way early on

00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:13.479
with the whole pandemic and everything that was going on,

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.679
so many listening to news and watching news,

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:18.359
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't have

00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:20.559
any level of information,

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.559
but the reality is that

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.719
I gave somebody a formula,

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:27.679
I said for every 20 minutes that you watch or listen to the news,

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.799
you ought to spend an hour in the Bible.

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:33.279
I don't know where I got that percentage kind of situation,

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.799
I just came up with it,

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.519
but what I was trying to convey was that,

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:40.359
man, we need the truth of God's Word.

00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:43.279
You sit around and you listen to these people all day long,

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:47.279
talking all their stuff that they're spewing out.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:50.479
I sat in the hospital room one day,

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:51.799
visiting with someone,

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:56.999
and we actually had to be confined to the waiting room.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:59.359
It used to be that you could go to a hospital

00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:01.359
if someone was having surgery and you could wait for them,

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:02.359
you could go back there,

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:06.919
and I got these passes that basically let me go anywhere in the hospital

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:10.879
until COVID-19, I can't go anywhere near the hospital.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:14.000
And of course, things are relaxing now,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
but it used to be that you could go in there

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.239
and as a pastor, I could go in and pray,

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.279
and I could wait and I could get in,

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.879
it didn't matter if it was visiting hours or not,

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:24.959
I had passes to be able to get in.

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.119
And I remember on one particular occasion,

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:28.319
someone's having a heart cath,

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:32.159
and I sat with the family there in the waiting room,

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:34.159
and there was this show on, I'm going to be honest with you,

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.720
I've never watched the show in its entirety,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.679
but the show was called The View.

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.839
And it was on in the lobby,

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:46.000
and it was loud, and it was obnoxious,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.919
and I wanted to throw something at the TV.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:52.759
And I wasn't even watching it.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:56.639
But the stuff that was spewing out of the mouths

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.720
of those people on that talk show was ridiculous.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.720
And unfortunately, there were a whole host of people

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080
that were sitting there watching it,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.679
otherwise I would've just gone over and turned the thing off.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:12.720
But it was loud, and it was obnoxious.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.319
And we just overheard some of it.

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:16.479
Listen, some people that are listening

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.799
to that junk every single day, man, it's messing them up.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.080
Amen?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.199
Some people watching online

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:25.759
might send me some emails later, amen.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It'd be all good, amen.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.199
It's the one thing that's interesting about online,

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:32.559
you never know who's watching, right?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:36.479
And that's okay, I stand by it, amen.

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:38.360
It's junk.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.239
And can I tell you that the networks are full of that stuff.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.879
And you got these talking heads,

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:46.239
and you got these people,

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:49.399
and if we're not careful as to not only

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:50.839
who we associate with,

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:54.839
but also who and what we listen to,

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:57.720
how it influences us, how it affects us,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.000
how it messes with our worldview.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.319
And all of a sudden, we find ourselves saying some things

00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:08.599
that we've actually never done any research on,

00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:11.839
and we've never validated the truth of,

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.720
you know, and there are people

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.639
that say things that aren't true.

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:19.359
You know that?

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:23.160
Years ago, there was a commercial about the,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.479
you know, how do you know that?

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.040
I read it on the internet,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.040
and the idea of the commercial

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.559
was that everything on the internet is true.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:34.239
You understand that's not true.

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:36.119
Just because you find it on the internet

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:37.279
doesn't mean it's true.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:42.160
By the way, many of those search engine companies

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160
run algorithms that put up search results

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.359
that they want to put up.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.760
I told you when I was preaching through the book of Genesis

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.799
and dealing with Noah's flood,

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.600
because we're still preaching through the book of Genesis,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.839
it'll be a while,

00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:00.160
but dealing with Noah's flood in particular,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.679
you type in Noah's flood,

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:03.839
and you're gonna get a whole lot of stuff about it

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:08.559
being some fairy tale kind of a situation,

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:10.079
because the algorithms are written

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:13.239
to promote those things first.

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:15.559
Look at Psalm 1.

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:17.040
This is where I want to go this evening.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.040
Psalm chapter number one.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.679
I believe the principles in mind from Proverbs 13 and 19

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:27.679
with regard to choosing your companions wisely,

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:30.079
I believe we see in the first three verses

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:34.239
of the first Psalm evidence of someone

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:38.079
that took the principles that we looked at

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:39.519
and lived by them.

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:41.160
Now, the reality is that many of us

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.000
are familiar with Psalm 1.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.880
It's a very familiar passage of Scripture.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.119
In fact, many of us have probably memorized the first Psalm,

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:50.720
and we could stand up and quote it,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.239
and sometimes I fear that what happens

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:55.600
with a passage of Scripture

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.679
that has a high level of understanding

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:01.799
that we're extremely familiar with it

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:04.720
is that sometimes we can miss things,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.440
because we simply, oh yeah, I know that.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.000
I know that account.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.239
I know that situation.

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:13.440
I know what happens.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.720
And the reality is that,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.440
especially if you've been saved for any length of time,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.479
if you read your Bible regularly,

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.079
you must always be careful to keep it fresh.

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:32.839
What I mean by that is that we don't just get into autopilot.

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:35.359
That we ask the Lord, show me something,

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:37.199
teach me, minister to me.

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:41.359
And we have had the opportunity, personally speaking,

00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:43.519
I've read passages of Scripture,

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:45.720
I've preached passages of Scripture

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.079
that I've gone back to weeks later,

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.679
months later, years later,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.959
and I've read again,

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.199
and man, I didn't understand that before.

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.160
I didn't see that before.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.320
And God's Word is a living book.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.199
And we must not allow the holy to become common.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.679
In Psalm 1, notice the Bible says,

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:10.079
blessed is the man that walketh not

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.559
in the counsel of the ungodly,

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:14.199
nor standeth in the way of sinners,

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.880
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.320
Notice it says, but,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.399
his delight is in the law of the Lord,

00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:28.279
and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:32.160
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.880
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.000
His leaf also shall not wither,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.600
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.959
Just gonna look at the first three verses this evening.

00:17:43.959 --> 00:17:46.239
If you're taking notes, number one,

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:50.440
I want you to notice how this man acts.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.760
Notice how he acts.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.279
We often would look at this as being the blessed man.

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:55.959
Blessed is the man.

00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:59.079
And I want you to notice two things

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.919
with regard to what God tells us,

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:04.639
with regard to his action from verses one and two.

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:07.799
Number one, if I could summarize verse number one,

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:09.760
I would summarize it this way.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.079
Get out of the world.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:15.079
Just get out of the world.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.440
We are in the world, but we are not of the world.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.919
Isn't that what Jesus said in John 17?

00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:22.679
That's what he said.

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:26.880
And the reality is that if you read John 17,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.440
and by the way, that's the Lord's Prayer,

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.639
you understand that as he's going through there,

00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:34.679
and as he's praying, notice this,

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:37.679
he says in verse number 15,

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:41.559
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:46.159
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.919
You know what that means?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:48.839
There's evil.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.559
Amen?

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.599
We live in an evil world.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.080
And it says, Jesus, he says,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.719
I'm not praying that you should take them out of the world,

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:03.119
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:05.479
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:07.400
Sanctify them through thy Word.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.719
Thy Word is truth.

00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:13.000
And so we find as we look at verse number one

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.479
and summarize the thought of verse number one,

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:20.119
it would simply be this, get out of the world.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.760
Get out of the world.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.679
Stop allowing the world to influence you.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.679
Look at what the Bible says.

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:28.520
Blessed is the man.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.760
Look at the progression.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.760
Number one, that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:39.799
He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:42.719
He's understanding that there's some influences,

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:43.559
there's some counsel.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.400
He's not gonna walk in that direction.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.640
It's interesting as you begin to see the progression

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.400
of the verse of Scripture,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.559
that the Bible says that he walketh not

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.080
in the counsel of the ungodly.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.080
Notice number two, nor standeth in the way of sinners.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.560
You start walking in that way.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.360
Before long, you start standing amongst them.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.960
You've been walking,

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.640
and now you're standing,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.760
and you're getting more influence.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.600
You're hearing more.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.680
More of that world is being put on you

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.600
and the thoughts of the world.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.520
And we find, listen, the enemy...

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.960
Something about Satan.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.840
He's a liar.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.040
He's a liar. Right?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.800
So you think that as a liar

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.680
and as a deceiver,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.280
he's going to package that thing

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.520
as well as he possibly can.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.360
And what happens here is we find

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.280
the Bible says,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.960
"...blessed is the man that walketh not

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.560
in the counsel of the ungodly,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.160
nor standeth in the way of sinners..."

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.800
Then notice this progression.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.800
"...nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.320
So from walking, to standing, to sitting.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.800
You think about Lot.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.400
Lot and Abraham have a discussion.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.280
There was some contention among their herdsmen.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.760
Right?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.200
Choose the land. What does Lot do?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.920
He sees it.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.000
He says, I want that land.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.320
Initially, he just pitches his tent toward Sodom.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.760
Before long, he's living in Sodom.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.920
Before long, he's sitting at the gate.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.720
He lost his family.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.200
The Bible says in the New Testament

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.640
that this righteous man vexed his righteous soul.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.800
Can you imagine?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.880
How'd that happen?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.360
You just start facing the wrong direction.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.040
You just start walking with the ungodly.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.640
You start standing and hearing

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.880
and being influenced.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.960
Sitting in the seat of the scornful.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.680
I think about the way in which,

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.960
and I won't read the quote to you this evening.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.040
I've read it before.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.200
If you'd like to have it,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.680
I'll be glad to send it to you.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.800
But the reality is that the enemy

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.800
has taken our classrooms in America

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.920
to use them as a platform

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.040
to promote their agenda.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.680
It's a known fact

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.760
that they're seeking to promote their agenda.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.360
The Darwinian evolution, the humanism,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.360
and all of the things that are going on.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.760
And we find that in the classrooms

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.640
across America,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.680
this stuff is being taught.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.160
We find here the blessed man.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.440
We notice how he acts.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.120
Number one, get out of the world.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.160
Don't allow those things to influence you.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.440
Be careful.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.400
Remember, choose your companions wisely.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:06.120
Understand the truth of influence.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.480
Get out of the world, but number two,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.000
get into the Word.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.040
Get into the Word.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.120
I read already in John 17,

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.920
he talked about the fact that

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.160
he's praying not that we'd be delivered from the world,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.080
that we're in the world,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.320
but we're not of the world.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.000
And then he says,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.520
sanctify them through Thy Word.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.800
Thy Word is truth.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.880
So we get out of the world,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.800
but we must get into the Word.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.080
Notice the actions in verse 2.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.440
There's this contrast as the verse begins

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.960
with the word,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.920
but His delight is in the law of the Lord.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.920
That word delight carries with it

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.760
the idea of taking pleasure in.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.480
If reading the Bible is a chore,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.280
if reading the Bible is a checkmark

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.200
on a book somewhere,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.760
if that's reading the Bible,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.120
if that's kind of the approach,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.600
that's not really delighting in the law of the Lord.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.120
Delighting in the law of the Lord is when,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.600
so let me use this maybe simple analogy.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.640
There are certain foods that perhaps you eat

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.920
because they're good for you.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.600
Some of those green vegetables.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.320
My dad always, as a child,

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.040
as I would have and I never ate them

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.000
and to this day, I don't eat them.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.800
My mom likes them.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.040
Beets.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.600
I think they taste like dirt.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.280
If you like beets, that's up to you.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.680
That's fine.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.880
I just don't like them.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.960
And my dad would cut those things up on his plate

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.600
and he'd say, oh, these are so good.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.480
And he was lying every second of the way.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.640
He's just eating them because supposedly

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.320
there's some benefit of eating them.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.360
There are other things,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.640
cheese steaks, cheeseburgers, pizza,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640
you know, all that kind of stuff,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.400
like I don't have to force myself to eat it, right?

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.080
Like it's just good.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.200
Somebody mentioned to me today

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.520
about eating Brussels sprouts.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.840
Ugh, Holly likes those things.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.920
I can't stand them.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.800
Dean's ready to go eat, amen?

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.120
But what I'm saying is that

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.200
when I look at the way in which the terminology is used,

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.280
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.800
it's not this thing of I have to read my Bible.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.360
It's not this thing of let me make sure

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.360
I check this box because I want to read.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.880
No, no, I'm delighting in it.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.200
This is God speaking to me.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.840
God's love letter, if I could use that analogy

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.480
to us as His people.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.080
Listen, there was never a time that Holly,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.440
when we were dating,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.560
would give me a note or a letter

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.000
that I was not anxious to read.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.200
I'm being honest.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.160
She'd leave a note in my box in college,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.840
and it didn't matter if I was running

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.640
a little bit late to class or whatever.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.640
I want to read it.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.720
I want to know the content of it.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.000
I never just kind of tucked it away somewhere

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.880
and well, I'll see what that says later.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.920
No, it was never my,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.720
it just wasn't.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.680
You guys remember when you were dating?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.880
See, today they got all this technology, right?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.440
We used to actually write notes

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.200
like on paper with pen.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.920
Imagine that, right?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.600
And you were anxious to read it.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.280
And there were times in which

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.920
maybe I was going to go on a trip.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.120
I remember going to a national preaching conference

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.840
down in North Carolina and we were dating

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.880
and she gave me some notes and she said,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.760
now don't read them until...

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.840
What do you think you want to do?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.320
Armando, you want to read it, right?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.880
Because this is from the person that I love,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.840
the person that I'm planning to marry.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.120
This is a love note.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.200
Amen?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.200
This is God's Word.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.000
God loves us.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.400
And He gave us this book.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.520
And we ought to delight in the law of the Lord.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.440
Oh man, I get to read my Bible.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.400
It's not a chore, it's a delight.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.960
In times in which we're reading our Bible

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.080
and say, man, I can't believe that much time went by.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.080
I understand we have other things to do in life.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.520
I understand we have jobs

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.000
and various things that we have to tend to

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.720
and kids that are running around

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.280
that need some breakfast.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.720
And I get it, right? I understand.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.320
What I'm saying is that

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.000
the picture that we get here

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.200
of this delighting in the law of the Lord

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.560
is taking pleasure in it.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.880
I can't wait until I can read my Bible.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.080
If you're morning,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.920
I personally like to read in the morning

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.760
after I have my coffee.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.000
Holly likes to read in the morning

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.680
as soon as her eyeballs open up.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.280
I'd close my eyeballs and go back to sleep.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.080
So I don't do it that way.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.840
I like to get some coffee and I like to read.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.480
Occasionally, something happens.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.640
Somebody's in the hospital.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.160
Something weird happens.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.480
And your time with God gets interrupted.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480
You're a mom and a child wakes up

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.720
before they're supposed to.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.200
Whatever it might be.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.120
For me, that time got interrupted.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.880
I can't wait until I can get back

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.720
to my time with God.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.559
My delight in the law of the Lord.

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:36.840
I'm not patting myself on the back.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.119
I'm just simply saying,

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:39.760
when we look at the imagery

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.600
that is given to us,

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.160
when we understand what's taking place,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.280
listen, if you can watch some news network

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.239
longer than you can read God's Word,

00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:52.520
we need to do some examination.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.119
Amen?

00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:57.080
Let's just be transparent with one another.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.080
If we can watch the news for a couple hours a day,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.280
but we can only read the Bible

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.880
for a few minutes a day,

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.559
not only is there a problem,

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:10.400
but there's going to be greater problems.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.880
His delight is in the law of the Lord.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.239
Look at what it says.

00:29:13.239 --> 00:29:16.040
And in His law,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:23.400
doth He meditate day and night.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.440
No doubt, as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.760
and we consider the actions of this blessed man

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:32.119
and we see that he's getting out of the world

00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:34.679
and he's getting into the Word,

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:37.960
we find that he's meditating

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.360
to dwell on anything in thought,

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.520
to muse upon it.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.160
Throughout the Psalms, you'll see

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.000
that little word often used,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.799
selah.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:50.920
It's good for us to meditate on the Word of God.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.559
It's good for us to just let the Word of God

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:57.280
just be in our minds and stew over it

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.080
and just saturate our minds.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.720
He combines our souls with the Word of God.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.360
It says day and night.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.160
No doubt in my mind that here in Psalm 1,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.520
there's some connection to the truth in Joshua 1.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.960
I preached a message on this

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.720
as we went through the series early on

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.600
in the book of Joshua.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.260
Joshua 1 and verse 8.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.720
When God says to Joshua,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.080
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.040
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.680
Why? Why, Joshua, should you meditate in this law,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.960
in this book of the law day and night?

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.760
That thou mayest observe to do according to all

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.200
that is written therein.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.200
For then, then is after, right?

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.400
For then, thou shalt make thy way prosperous,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.280
and then, thou shalt have good success.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.800
I made the statement this morning

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.400
that oftentimes we want the result

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.600
without the process.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.840
We want the then, but we don't want the process.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.800
We want to have our way being prosperous.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.520
We want the good success,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.240
but we might not want to follow

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.840
the instruction that is given.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.560
And I find here that the Word of God

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.600
is the delight of this man,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.160
and not only does he take pleasure in it

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.200
and have it as being his delight,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.160
but the Bible says that he meditates in it

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.080
day and night.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.760
Day and night.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.360
Think about that.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.280
Really, the idea is we're meditating day and night,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.520
that throughout the day,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.960
the truth of that which I have read

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.920
is on my mind.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.800
I wonder how often,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.400
as we read our Bibles in the morning,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.320
I wonder how often we think about

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.920
what we read as we go throughout the day.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.520
It's really on our mind.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.800
Like we're really meditating on it.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.920
It's really affecting our behavior that day.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.200
That we really ask the question,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.720
how is it that what I read today

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.000
can be put in practice in my life today?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
We find that the first two verses of Psalm 1,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.160
we note how he acts.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.240
In verse number 3 of Psalm 1,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.200
we note how he abounds.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.240
Notice what the Bible says,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.680
and he shall be.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.920
Like, there's an analogy that is given to us,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.680
a picture that is describing

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.040
the way in which this man

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.400
that is the blessed man,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.000
how he will abound.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.520
He shall be, notice,

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.840
like a tree planted by the rivers of water.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.160
In your mind, no doubt,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.400
as you think about the imagery that is given

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.640
in verse number 3 of Psalm 1,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.320
we have the image of strength and stability

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.040
as this tree that is planted

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.800
by the rivers of water.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.520
This tree that as we go through

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.520
the progression of verse number 3,

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.560
we'll understand that it flourishes.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.920
We understand that it's fruitful

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.080
and so on and so forth.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.880
But we get that picture immediately

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.480
of some stability and some strength.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.800
Remember as we started that series

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.040
and we didn't get very far into the series

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.200
in the book of Titus,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.200
and we titled our series in the book of Titus

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.680
Grounded and Settled.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.640
And the reason really the thought

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.680
of the book of Titus

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.240
and what Titus was commissioned to do there

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.200
in Crete is he would go and ordain

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.920
and set in order the things that were wanting.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.520
And we understand all that he was responsible for doing.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.680
And we get this picture of being

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.800
grounded and settled.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.200
The Bible tells us in Colossians 1

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.840
and verse number 23,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.680
if you continue in the faith,

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.000
grounded and settled,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.840
and be not moved away from the hope

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.760
of the Gospel which ye have heard

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.360
and which was preached to every creature

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.600
which is under heaven,

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:24.240
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.160
And we see here in this picture

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.040
in verse number 3,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.680
this tree that's planted by the rivers of water,

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.040
this strength and stability.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.160
But the Bible doesn't end there.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.480
The Bible says this in verse number 3,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.840
that bringeth forth His fruit,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.280
and then notice this,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.600
in His season.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.240
You know that fruit trees have seasons.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.880
And we would see here

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.000
that the understanding as we would begin

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.200
to see what's happening,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.320
that bringeth forth His fruit in His season,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.480
that it's not only fruitful,

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.040
but it's at the right time.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.880
The reality is that there's some times

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.080
that we're not on the same time schedule

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.800
that God's on,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.520
but it's our time schedule that's wrong,

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.960
not God's.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.360
Because God's time schedule's perfect.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.560
And the reality is that we look here

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.640
and we see this One that is referred to

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.120
as blessed as the man,

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.880
and we see His actions, His behavior.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.800
He's getting out of the world.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.440
He's getting into the Word.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.240
And we know how He abounds.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.320
He's like a tree.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.880
The strength and the stability.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.520
But He's fruitful.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.520
And He's fruitful in His season

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.880
at the right time.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.040
We find that the Bible then makes this statement,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:56.120
His leaf also shall not wither.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.400
It's interesting.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.400
If you were to think about the area

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.160
in which the psalmist lived.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.880
You would think about the terrain.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.560
Now, I've never been to Israel.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.720
I've seen some pictures.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.240
I know many people that have,

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.680
and I hope one day to be able to get there.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.880
If I don't get there,

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.600
I'll see the New Jerusalem at least.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440
Amen.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.880
And the reality, however,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.480
is that if you do a little study

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.600
and what have you,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.880
you could find out

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.520
that as you look at the imagery

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.120
of verse number three,

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.600
this tree that's planted by the rivers of water

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.400
and how important that is

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.160
for the sustainability of trees

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.880
in that particular region.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.520
And as you would deal with periods of drought

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.200
and not having water,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.400
and you could see how because of the heat

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.960
and because of all of those things,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.840
you could see some leaves that wither.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.840
Some leaves that wither.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.560
See, why is it that His leaf also shall not wither?

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.040
Well, if I could use the analogy

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.240
that He's plugged into the right source, right?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.680
He's gotten out of the world,

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.640
He's gotten into the Word,

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.080
and He's receiving that sustenance spiritually

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.600
from the Lord through His Word,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.840
and we begin to see how He abounds

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.560
and we begin to see the way

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.840
in which this is described for us

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.040
in verse number three.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.760
And really, we're getting a good picture.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.640
I mean, this is a positive thing.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.240
This is a result that is desired.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.280
Amen?

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.720
And then it ends in verse number three

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.720
with whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:49.120
Whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.760
Oh, so you mean I can do whatever I want to do

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760
and I'm going to prosper?

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.600
No, no, no, no.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.000
You missed all of the message.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.920
You missed it all.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.160
Because what we're going to do

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.320
is we're going to do what we have found

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.240
that God wants us to do.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.840
And when we're doing what God wants us to do,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.560
then God is going to bless that effort and that work,

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.360
and we might not be prosperous

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.880
from a world's perspective,

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.720
but we must understand that God's definition

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.240
of prosperity and success differs greatly

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.040
than the definition of the world.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.160
There are some that have this idea

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.600
that I'm a success if I end my life

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.480
with a certain amount of money

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.720
and a certain amount of goods

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.280
and all of these sort of things.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.200
The reality is a child of God.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.239
I'm just wanting to hear,

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:46.040
well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.600
Amen?

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.160
See, many people,

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.640
as we look to the truth of the Word of God

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.360
and we understand what God's Word has told us

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.360
and we find here that He says,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.200
whatsoever He doeth shall prosper.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.960
When I'm getting out of the world,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.360
when I'm getting into the Word

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.000
and I'm delighting in the Word

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.600
and I'm meditating on the Word

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.880
and I'm no doubt because of those actions,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.679
I'm obeying God and I'm following God's plan,

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:17.000
this blessed result of verse number three

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.640
is evident in my life

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.840
and we begin to see God working.

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:24.119
Psalm 37,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.960
the Bible says trust in the Lord

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.000
in verse number three and do good.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.720
So shalt thou dwell in the land

00:39:31.799 --> 00:39:34.200
and verily thou shalt be fed.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.799
Notice this,

00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:39.200
delight thyself also in the Lord

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.600
and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.200
How many of you have ever heard a child of God say,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.920
God said He'll give me the desires of my heart

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.360
and they forgot the whole first part of the verse?

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.520
Right?

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.880
God didn't just say,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880
I'll give you the desires of your heart.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:07.280
heart. He said, delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.760
thy heart. Notice thine heart. Notice verse five. Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:21.760
also in him and he shall bring it to pass. See, when I delight myself in the Lord, here's

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:32.480
what happens. His desires become my desires. And if his desires are my desires, then guess

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.920
what? He's going to give me the desires of mine heart. Why? Because they're his desires.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.960
Does that make sense? And so often we've taken things and we've pulled and we've picked and

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.640
we've taken and we've come to a completely different conclusion. We've got people running

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.520
around doing their own thing, doing whatever they want to do and saying, well, God said

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.960
he's going to bless me. What is your description of blessing? Just because you have a good

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:09.040
salary doesn't mean God's blessing you. In America, we look at it that way sometimes.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:17.920
Biblically speaking, that is not in any way, shape or form the reality of whether God's

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:24.200
blessing someone or not. God promised to provide for us and I'm thankful he does.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:31.120
Most of us have probably, at least not in recent years, have had to pray for our daily

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:40.160
bread. God's been good to us in this nation. I mean, he's been real good to us. And if

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:50.400
we're not careful in kind of promoting some of those ideas, we'd have a hard time being

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.040
able to take that same type of teaching to some of these other third world countries

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:04.160
around the world where, by the way, the Word of God works and is truth. Right? This thing

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:11.680
of the prosperity gospel and all these things that are promoted, it's not biblical. I'm

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.919
thankful that God chooses to bless and that God chooses to bless some with wealth and

00:42:16.919 --> 00:42:22.200
that's perfectly fine. I'm not opposed to it whatsoever. But we have to understand that

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.480
as we look here in the passage of scripture in Psalm chapter number one, and we kind of

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.720
bring full circle back to our thought this evening of choosing your companions wisely.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.680
Listen, if we're not careful this evening, we're going to be influenced by some people

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.840
in our world. We're going to be influenced by some things that we're hearing and we're

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:46.000
reading and it's going to cause us to go on a path completely different than what this

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.600
book teaches. And we have to understand that there is a battle that is raging and there

00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:00.360
are many voices out there. As I thought about that truth of many voices being out there

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.279
and understanding what's happening in our world today with all of these negative influences

00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:13.360
and all of these people that are teaching this teaching that is foreign to the truth

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.520
of the Word of God. And we find that we'd ask ourselves, see, there are times that people

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.240
come that grew up in a church and they come and they say something like this. Well, I

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:30.680
just don't believe that anymore. What changed? What happened? I've had the opportunity on

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:38.840
a few occasions to actually sit down and talk to some people and find out, do a little digging

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:46.639
and find out what happened. One man in particular, I remember like it was yesterday, I knocked

00:43:46.639 --> 00:43:52.480
on his door. It was a Saturday morning. And I began to speak to him about the Lord. Somebody

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.960
is grilling. It smells good. Amen. Somebody smell that? Yeah, you better shut that door.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:09.240
Amen. Or bring some over. The man that answered the door began to just exchange some simple

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:17.080
conversation. I told him who I was, where I was from and so on and so forth. And I asked

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:29.200
him if he was sure if he or did I go to heaven. He kind of chuckled. Can't know that. I began

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.360
to quote some verses of Scripture to him. And I'll never forget when I quoted John 14

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:42.760
verse number six, I said, Sir, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and he said, and the life. No

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:49.640
man cometh unto the Father, but by me. He said it. He finished the verse. It kind of took me back.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:45:01.399
Okay, this guy, he knows some stuff. We had an extended conversation. And through that

00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:06.959
conversation, I found out how he grew up, the church that he grew up in, what he had been

00:45:06.959 --> 00:45:20.520
taught, etc, etc. I said, man, what happened? He told me where he went to college. I had some

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:29.000
understanding of the university that he went to, and some of the secular influence that he would

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.920
be exposed to at that particular school. I didn't have a ton of information on that, but I did have

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:42.760
some understanding of it. And I began to inquire. So what happened? Well, I sat in this class and

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:50.640
began to name these classes that he sat in, and how that the professor systematically tore apart

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:59.679
his worldview and presented him with some other perspective than this perspective, and how it just

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:08.640
totally destroyed his faith. It was sad. I had the opportunity to meet with that man probably four or

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:17.640
five times over the course of maybe four months. And it did not matter what verse of Scripture I

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:26.040
went to, it didn't matter what I said to this man, he was in fully with that ideology. And it was so sad.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:36.679
I had thoughts, probably not the same way I think I'm now, with regard to how his parents must have

00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:47.040
felt, how his pastor must have felt from when he was a young child. I'm not suggesting that we can

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:54.600
force anybody to have a certain worldview or what have you, but the reality is that that person made a

00:46:54.600 --> 00:47:04.839
decision to be influenced by some that had a completely different worldview. And unfortunately, they did not

00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:15.720
have a firm enough grounding themselves to be able to withstand that. That's not the truth for everyone.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:22.360
There are some people that can go to some places and read some things, and they have enough spiritual

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:32.880
foundation that they can handle it. But you better be careful. You better be careful. Apologetics is such an

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:40.959
important truth, an area of study of being able to defend the truth and contend for the faith that's been

00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:52.040
delivered. And we find that there are many influences. And we have to be careful of who we associate with. We

00:47:52.040 --> 00:48:02.000
have to be careful of who and what we listen to. Because before long, we hear enough of that stuff. And it's just, I

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:13.600
mean, it is just permeating our society. I mean, the young children are being set in front of TVs that are showing

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:25.399
programs that are indoctrinating them as toddlers. It's happening. And then we wonder why they don't believe, why they

00:48:25.399 --> 00:48:33.799
fall away, why this happens and why that happens. Oh, we need to be careful. We need to be careful that we protect, that we

00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:45.320
manage how we're being influenced. And it would be a good exercise for us to not only know Philippians 4.8, but to

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:54.919
exercise Philippians 4.8. And so I'm going to put this in practice in my life. I'm going to be careful. And I am going to

00:48:54.919 --> 00:49:08.160
protect how I'm being influenced. And I'm going to get out of the world purposefully. And I am going to get into the Word. And

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:15.720
we better have right proportions. We better understand how important it is. And sometimes we can say, well, I just want to be

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:26.280
informed. Be careful. Be careful who you're listening to. Be careful how that stuff is affecting you. And we have the truth of God's

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:37.320
Word and how powerful it is to transform our lives and to give us all the answers that we need for life. Lord, we love you. We thank you

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:46.039
for loving us. We thank you for the counsel of the wise man here in Proverbs, both in chapter 13 and 19, as we've used these

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:54.760
verses as a starting point to get there to the blessed man in Psalm 1. God, we're thankful for the opportunity to observe his

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.599
action and then to see how he abounds. God, I pray that you would help us this evening.

00:50:00.599 --> 00:50:09.839
Lord, there are so many pieces of information that are so readily available to us.

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:13.359
Most today have technology at their fingertips.

00:50:13.359 --> 00:50:17.439
We can look up anything, we get alerts all the time, we're being influenced by so many

00:50:17.439 --> 00:50:18.919
different areas.

00:50:18.919 --> 00:50:26.159
God, I pray that you would help us to manage how we're being influenced, who we're being

00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:28.599
influenced by.

00:50:28.599 --> 00:50:36.079
Lord, help us to get out of the world and to get into thy word.

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:38.679
We thank you for the power of your word.

00:50:38.679 --> 00:50:48.019
Lord, I pray that you would help us to think and behave biblically.

00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:52.119
Help us to be grounded and settled.

00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:54.359
Work in our hearts and lives and we'll thank you for it.

00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:56.679
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:57.679
Would you stand with me?

00:50:57.679 --> 00:51:00.719
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:05.659
Maybe this evening there are some things that you've been exposed to that are influences

00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:09.279
that you need to repent of, let's just be honest.

00:51:09.279 --> 00:51:18.639
Maybe this evening you just want to pray and ask God to help you to be aware of the influencing

00:51:18.639 --> 00:51:25.879
that is taking place and that God would help you to be protected from being adversely influenced.

00:51:25.879 --> 00:51:27.599
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
