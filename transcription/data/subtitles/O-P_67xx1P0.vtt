00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
I'll make, by way of introduction, a few statements from several of the verses here in Psalm 11.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.760
The text for our message, however, will come from verse number 7.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.279
And what a powerful psalm that is before us.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.040
I am so thankful for all of the Bible, and what a blessing it is to have the Word of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.040
God.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.120
And as we think about the psalms in particular, what a joy to be able to read the psalms and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.639
to be encouraged and strengthened.

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:33.540
And the transparency of the psalmist often is in view, and that is a tremendous blessing.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.240
As we look at this particular psalm, I'm going to use as my title from verse number 7, for

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.060
the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.479
And that'll be the title for the message this evening, The Righteous Lord Loveth Righteousness.

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.380
Before we get into the meat of our message from that thought in verse number 7, let me

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.580
share just a few, highlight just a few things from this passage of Scripture.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.740
Notice in verse number 1, the psalmist begins by saying, in the Lord put I my trust.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.059
Isn't that a good statement?

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:12.900
I mean, we understand that He is Jehovah God, that He is the Lord God Almighty, that He

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.819
rules and He reigns, and it would only make sense, it would only be logical for us, understanding

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.459
who He is to place our trust in Him.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.660
And the psalmist declares at the onset of this passage of Scripture, in the Lord put

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.900
I my trust, how say ye to my soul, flee as a bird to your mountain.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.699
Notice in verse number 2, the Bible says, for lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:45.059
ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:49.739
As we look at the truth in verse number 2, we find that the Bible says that the enemy,

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:55.099
the wicked, that they bend their bow, really the idea here is the fact that the enemy is

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:01.300
on attack, the enemy is attacking, and we find that He's making us aware of the circumstances

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.379
and the situation, but remember, He's begun declaring to us in this particular passage,

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.220
He's already declared that He's put His trust in the Lord.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.179
He says in verse number 3, if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.259
If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:29.580
Notice how His attention quickly turns in verse number 4 in reminding Himself and declaring

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.259
for us that the Lord reigns, it says the Lord is in His holy temple, the Lord's throne is

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:43.339
in heaven, His eyes behold, His eyelids try the children of men.

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.419
Isn't it good to know that our God reigns?

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.779
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth is declared in the book of Revelation.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:56.300
We find that we serve the God of the universe and that though we live in the midst of a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.899
time and though the psalmist is describing for us a time in which the wicked bend their

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:08.460
bow, a time in which the enemy is on attack, a time in which the very foundations are being

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.339
attacked, He reminds us, He reminds Himself, He reminds the people of God that our God

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.899
reigns, that our God is still upon His throne.

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.399
What a great reminder for us this evening.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:26.300
We find that in verses 5 through 7, we're reminded of the truth that our God is the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.059
righteous judge.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:36.139
The Bible says the Lord trieth the righteous, but the wicked in Him that loveth violence,

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.500
His soul hateth.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.119
Upon the wicked He shall reign snares, fire and brimstone, and horrible tempest.

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.820
This shall be the portion of their cup.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.039
Why?

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:55.000
Verse 7, for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.240
His countenance doth behold the upright.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.679
We find that the psalmist here begins by reminding us and declaring for us that he's trusting

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.839
in the Lord.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:14.559
I hope this evening that each one of us could declare unashamedly that we trust in God.

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:16.359
That in the Lord put I my trust.

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.119
See, if our trust is in God, though all the things around us are shaken and though all

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:30.679
the enemy is raging and the heathen is raging, my trust is in the Lord.

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:35.420
We find that here, He reminds us of the righteous judge.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.320
We notice that the Bible says that the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.459
His countenance doth behold the upright.

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:49.359
This evening as we think of this thought that the righteous Lord loveth righteousness, if

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:54.079
you're taking notes this evening, notice number one, and it's a very simple truth,

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.079
that our God is righteous.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.179
Our God is righteous.

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.640
He's not becoming righteous.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.200
He is righteous.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.200
And we find that the Bible says that He, the righteous Lord, loveth righteousness.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.239
We find that the psalmist says in Psalm 145 and verse number 17, the Lord is righteous

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:17.720
in all His ways and holy in all His works.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.480
We understand this evening that our God is holy, and that attribute of our God is probably

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.059
the most pronounced attribute in all of the Scriptures, dealing with the fact that our

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.880
God is holy.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.880
Of course, we're mindful of various passages of Scripture, and one that runs to mind immediately

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.820
upon thinking of the holiness of God is Isaiah 6, when Isaiah sees God and all of His majesty

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.220
and His holiness, and the angels there, they cry out, holy, holy, holy.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.700
Our God is holy.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.299
The Bible teaches us that it's the people of God that we're to give thanks, the remembrance

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.220
of His holiness.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.000
And here we find that as we think about the righteous God that we serve, we would understand

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.260
that His righteousness really is the expression of His holiness as He deals with mankind.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.220
We find that the idea of God's righteousness means that He is just and lawful, that He

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.540
always does that which is right.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.739
And we ought to rejoice in that truth this evening.

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:26.179
We ought to be thankful this evening that the Bible tells us that the righteous Lord

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:30.059
loveth righteousness, that we understand that He is righteous.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:37.619
The Bible says in Psalm 119 and verse 142, thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.899
and thy law is the truth.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.339
Our God is righteous, and it's important for us to understand the truth this evening that

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:53.140
our God is righteous and that He loves righteousness.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.459
Look in Proverbs chapter 14, if you will, I mentioned to you that we mentioned some

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:04.859
things and go through quickly and highlight a few things in Psalm 11 and then jump from

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:09.899
there as we use verse 7 as really our main thought for the message this evening.

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:18.299
And as we understand that our God is righteous, we also understand that sin brings reproach.

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:25.959
In Proverbs chapter 14, the Bible says this, righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.500
Why is that?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.179
Because the truth that we just looked at in Psalm 11 and verse 7, the righteous Lord loveth

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.859
righteousness.

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:39.899
And so therefore, righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:40.899
Why?

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.739
Because God loves righteousness, because He is righteous.

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:48.299
And the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:55.140
And when we understand this evening this truth of Proverbs 14 and verse 34, that righteousness

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.779
exalteth a nation, sometimes we're led to think and have the idea that this means that

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:04.380
it will have some monetary type of blessing.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.980
And that's really not the fullness of what's being dealt with here.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.220
Though it may be that there are some temporal blessings that are enjoyed and experienced

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:20.140
by a righteous people, the reality is that we have the favor of God upon us.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.059
The Bible says that righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:35.140
But notice the last part of Proverbs 14 and verse 34, but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:41.460
God is righteous, sin brings reproach.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.739
The Bible says in Psalm 9 and verse number 17, this with regard to the subject of sin

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:54.020
bringing reproach, it says, the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.020
forget God.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.859
You say, well, that's strong language.

00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:58.940
That's the Bible.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.700
The Bible is strong.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.820
The Bible does confront.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.380
The Bible, you know, people talk about wanting to be politically correct.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.780
The reality is that I'd rather be biblically correct.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.900
Amen?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.859
And here the Bible says that the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:19.820
forget God.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.580
Isaiah chapter number 5.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.859
Notice what the Bible says here as we think about this truth that sin brings reproach.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:34.700
In Isaiah chapter number 5 and verses 20 and 21, the prophet of God is making us aware

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.820
of the circumstances and the things that are going on in the time in which he's ministering.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:46.219
And the Bible says this in Isaiah 5 and verse 20, woe unto them that call evil good and

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:51.780
good evil, that put darkness for light and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.340
and sweet for bitter.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.619
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight.

00:09:58.619 --> 00:09:59.659
Woe unto them.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:03.539
the Bible says, that call evil good and good evil.

00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:05.419
Listen, the reality is I understand

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:07.259
that Isaiah is prophesying

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:08.819
at the time in which he's prophesying,

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:12.459
and I understand the content of his prophecies

00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:14.719
in his ministry, but the reality this evening

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:17.639
is that truth from the Bible is applicable

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:20.939
to nations in general and to people groups.

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:24.099
And we find that truth in Proverbs 14 in verse 34,

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:26.219
that righteousness exalted the nation,

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:28.379
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:31.699
And we find here that the people of God,

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.899
they were calling evil good and good evil.

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:36.979
Do we not see it even in our own society?

00:10:38.099 --> 00:10:41.099
They call evil good and good evil.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.659
I wanna remind you of a couple of New Testament principles

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:48.419
that are really based upon Old Testament record,

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:51.179
and turn to the book of 2 Peter, if you will.

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:53.099
In 2 Peter chapter number two,

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:56.299
Peter is giving some instruction to these believers

00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:58.499
that are dealing with all sorts of adversity

00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:00.459
and difficulty, in fact, in chapter number two,

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.499
he's dealing specifically with the false teachers,

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.499
and he says this, that if there were false prophets then,

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.419
you can be assured that there will be false teachers now.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.979
And we know it to be so.

00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:12.379
We can study the Old Testament,

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.179
and we can read about the false prophets,

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.979
and we can see about how there were many

00:11:17.979 --> 00:11:20.179
that would desire to hear the message

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.179
from the false prophets.

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:23.099
They wanted their ears tickled,

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.739
and the reality is that there are many false teachers today.

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:30.539
And then Peter says this, beginning in verse number four,

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:34.139
he says, for if God spared not the angels that sinned,

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:36.139
but cast them down to hell,

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:38.019
and delivered them into chains of darkness

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:39.299
to be reserved unto judgment,

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.979
notice, and spared not the old world,

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:43.659
but saved Noah, the eighth person,

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:45.139
a preacher of righteousness,

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.539
bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly,

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:50.419
verse six, and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.299
into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow,

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:56.739
making them an ensample unto those

00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:00.339
that after should live ungodly.

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.499
Make note of the end of verse number six.

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:04.179
Verse seven, and delivered just Lot,

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.979
vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked,

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:09.819
for that righteous man dwelling among them

00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:12.939
in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:15.539
from day to day with their unlawful deeds.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:18.819
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:20.179
and to reserve the unjust

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:22.979
unto the day of judgment to be punished.

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:25.459
In Jude, the book only has one chapter,

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.179
and in verse number seven,

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.259
the Bible says even as Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:30.939
and the cities about them in like manner,

00:12:30.939 --> 00:12:32.659
giving themselves over to fornication

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.419
and going after strange flesh,

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:37.179
are set forth for an example,

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.899
suffering the vengeance of eternal life.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:42.139
We find that in verse number seven of the book of Jude,

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:44.819
the Bible specifically speaks about the destruction

00:12:44.819 --> 00:12:47.059
of Sodom and Gomorrah and those surrounding cities,

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.419
and the Bible says that they are set forth for an example.

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:53.619
I said to make note of the end of verse number six

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:55.459
there in 2 Peter 2,

00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:58.179
where the Bible again is using the example

00:12:58.179 --> 00:12:59.499
of that Old Testament record

00:12:59.499 --> 00:13:01.539
of Sodom and Gomorrah being destroyed,

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:05.219
and the Bible says making them an example

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:10.219
unto those that after should live ungodly.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:11.979
Can I tell you this evening,

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:12.819
there are a lot of people

00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:14.739
that aren't taking note to the example.

00:13:15.739 --> 00:13:19.699
They think they're gonna somehow avoid judgment.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.739
They think that somehow it's not gonna come to them.

00:13:23.739 --> 00:13:25.859
No, no, the Bible says that righteousness

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:26.859
exalteth a nation,

00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:29.379
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:31.659
And we find that our God is righteous,

00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:33.299
but sin brings reproach.

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:34.619
We find in the book of Amos,

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:37.059
would you turn to the book of Amos with me this evening,

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.379
and Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah,

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:42.139
just so you have an idea of where it is,

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:44.219
one preacher as he was going to a minor prophet,

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:45.699
he says it's just after Genesis

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.139
and just before Revelation,

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.219
and that helps a whole lot, does it not?

00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:54.219
And so we find Amos, a prophet of God,

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.979
and we read this book of Amos,

00:13:56.979 --> 00:14:01.979
and we find that primarily that Amos is prophesying

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:05.539
to the nation of Israel, the 10 tribes of the north.

00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:10.059
That's the primary focus of his ministry, of his prophecy.

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:14.579
But in Amos 1.1 through Amos 2.8,

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:17.659
we see that in rapid succession,

00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:22.659
a number of regions and peoples are described.

00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:24.659
I do not have the time this evening

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:28.699
to develop all that is contained in Amos 1 and 2,

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:29.699
and really, obviously,

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:30.939
studying through the whole book of Amos

00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:32.299
is a profitable study,

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:33.899
but I want you to notice what the Bible says

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:35.059
in the verse number one.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:36.219
It says, the words of Amos,

00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:38.219
who was among the herdmen of Tekoa,

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:39.819
which he saw concerning Israel

00:14:40.459 --> 00:14:41.699
in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah.

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:43.699
Now, we're understanding the timing

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:44.819
in which he's prophesying.

00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:48.259
Uzziah was a good king until he was strong, right?

00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:49.739
And then when he was strong, what did he do?

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:51.299
He tried to take the place of the priest,

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.419
and he went in to offer incense, and he became a leper.

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:57.179
The Bible says, not only that it gives us the timeline,

00:14:57.179 --> 00:14:58.499
the days of Uzziah, king of Judah,

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:01.659
and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash,

00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:05.799
king of Israel, he was a wicked man, ungodly.

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:09.139
We know that Israel did not have any good kings,

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.939
and Jeroboam was a wicked man,

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:13.939
and the Bible says it was two years before the earthquake.

00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:16.179
Notice in verse number two, and he said,

00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:20.979
notice this, the Lord will roar from Zion,

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.659
and utter His voice from Jerusalem,

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:27.379
and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn,

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:29.379
and the top of Carmel shall wither.

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.619
Over the next several verses,

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.179
really the rest of chapter number one

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:36.019
and the first section of chapter number two,

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.579
we find again, these regions are called out,

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:41.379
these nations, these people groups are called out,

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.579
and it's interesting, I don't have time

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:47.059
to develop all of it, but I want to make note of two things.

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:50.859
In each particular group that is referenced,

00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:53.059
there is a repeated phrase.

00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:55.259
Notice with me in verse number three.

00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:57.339
Thus saith the Lord.

00:15:57.339 --> 00:15:59.619
That's the first of these repeated phrases,

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:01.939
so there are three repeated phrases.

00:16:01.939 --> 00:16:02.779
Thus saith the Lord.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:04.219
Now that's important for us to understand, why?

00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:05.259
Because God is saying this.

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:07.059
Verse number three, Amos 1.

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:08.779
Amos 1 and verse number three.

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:13.059
And so God is speaking, this is the Lord God Almighty,

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:14.779
Amos is a prophet of God,

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:16.819
and the Bible says, thus saith the Lord.

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:19.939
Now, you ought to give heed and attention

00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:21.619
to what God is saying, amen?

00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:23.139
Every time we open the Word of God,

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:25.139
we know that this book, all Scripture,

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:26.459
is given by inspiration of God,

00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:28.819
and we need to take heed to what the Word of God says,

00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:33.379
and it says this, for three transgressions of,

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:34.899
here it says Damascus,

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:36.899
in each of the other sections it will name

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:40.539
the particular region or nation or people group,

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:43.659
it says this, for three transgressions of Damascus

00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:46.379
and for four.

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:49.979
In the next section it says for three transgressions of Gaza

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:52.179
and for four, for three transgressions of Tyrus

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:55.459
and for so on and so forth through the entire passage.

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:56.299
What is he saying?

00:16:56.299 --> 00:16:58.299
Why is he using that vernacular?

00:16:58.299 --> 00:16:59.779
Really what he's telling us is that

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:02.579
this is a pattern of wickedness.

00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:06.139
This is not a situation where it was a one-off, if you will.

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:08.739
That there was just a moment of wickedness.

00:17:08.739 --> 00:17:11.739
No, this is a pattern of wickedness

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.899
for three transgressions and for four.

00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:19.099
He then says this, notice in verse number three again,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:24.099
I will not turn away the punishment thereof.

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:30.139
Those are important statements to take note of.

00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:31.859
Number one, there's a pattern of wicked,

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:33.339
well number one, God is speaking.

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:35.339
Number two, there's a pattern of wickedness.

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:36.659
And number three, God says,

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:39.539
I will not turn away the punishment.

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:43.219
We understand there's a principle of sowing and reaping.

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:45.699
For it shall man sow it, that shall he also reap.

00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:47.059
We understand that principle

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:48.619
and we see here the wickedness.

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:51.059
Again, keeping in mind with me this evening

00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:53.819
that sin brings reproach.

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.979
That righteousness exalteth a nation

00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:58.259
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:03.259
And we read in chapter number one, verses three through five

00:18:03.659 --> 00:18:07.059
the prophecy specifically is to Damascus or Syria.

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:08.379
In verses six through eight,

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:12.379
the prophecy is to Philistia or Gaza.

00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:16.019
We find in verses nine and 10, it's to Tyrus or Tyre.

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:18.299
In verses 11 and 12, it's to Edom.

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:21.739
In verses 13 through 15, it's to Ammon.

00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:23.539
We notice as we get into chapter number two

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:26.499
in verses one through three, it's to Moab.

00:18:26.499 --> 00:18:30.179
And then we come to verses four and five of chapter two

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:32.339
and it's concerning Judah.

00:18:32.339 --> 00:18:33.299
Concerning Judah.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.619
See, in the first chapter

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:38.459
and in the first three verses of chapter number two,

00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:39.979
it's dealing with various people groups

00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:43.379
that are surrounding the people of God.

00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:45.979
And now we find that in verses four and five,

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:49.339
that Judah is not excluded.

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.699
That the prophet says, thus saith the Lord,

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:54.219
for three transgressions of Judah and for four,

00:18:54.219 --> 00:18:56.459
I will not turn away the punishment thereof.

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:58.940
Now, I want you to just for a moment this evening,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.619
consider being one that would hear this prophecy.

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.419
And you're receiving this prophecy,

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:05.739
you're hearing this prophecy

00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:07.219
and you're hearing about Damascus

00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:09.859
and you say, yep, they're really bad over there, aren't they?

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.539
They got their judgment coming.

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:14.500
And then you hear about those in Gaza

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.139
and you say, yeah, those guys over there, man,

00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:17.699
they're really bad over there

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:20.699
and they ought to be judged in Tyre and Edom

00:19:20.699 --> 00:19:22.259
and Ammon and Moab.

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:24.779
But then you hear Judah.

00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:26.219
Get a little closer to home.

00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:34.379
Notice in verse number four of chapter two,

00:19:34.379 --> 00:19:36.940
thus saith the Lord for three transgressions of Judah

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.539
and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof.

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:41.379
Notice what it says,

00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:45.419
because they have despised the law of the Lord

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:48.699
and have not kept his commandments.

00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:51.219
And their lies caused them to err

00:19:51.219 --> 00:19:53.419
after the which their fathers have walked.

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.459
But I will send a fire upon Judah

00:19:56.459 --> 00:19:58.699
and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:05.399
The next group in verses six, really throughout the end of the book of Amos, but contextually

00:20:05.399 --> 00:20:10.799
as we're looking at the immediate context of the pronouncement of judgment in verses

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:14.159
six through eight of chapter two, Israel is in sight.

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:18.519
The Bible says, thus saith the Lord, for three transgressions of Israel and for four, I will

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:21.679
not turn away the punishment thereof.

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:26.919
Throughout the remainder of the book of Amos, we find that the focus is upon Israel and

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:28.979
about the judgment of God that would come.

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:33.899
We understand that Israel would be taken captive by the Assyrians, that they came in and they

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.619
did destroy and they did take captive.

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:41.639
We understand that Judah, not long thereafter, was destroyed by the Babylonians.

00:20:41.639 --> 00:20:43.439
They were taken into captivity.

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:46.239
The judgment did come upon the people.

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:47.239
Why?

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:50.559
Because sin brings reproach.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.799
Sin brings reproach.

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:56.959
I would submit to you this evening that America is ripe for judgment.

00:20:56.959 --> 00:21:00.919
I understand this evening that America is not mentioned in our text of Scripture.

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:06.279
I understand that it does not need to be there, however, to be able to take Bible principles

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:08.679
and properly apply them.

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:13.719
And when we understand, when we look around the nation in which we live, and I love the

00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:18.159
nation in which we live, we would say, if we'd be honest this evening, that America

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.739
is ripe for judgment.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:25.259
Is it not true that we have despised the law of the Lord?

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:28.539
Is it not true that we have not kept His commandments?

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:33.159
You understand that like no other nation, this nation had a standing and a starting

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:37.859
with the principles of this book.

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:43.919
Remember the truth that I shared with you in Psalm 9, in verse 17, the wicked shall

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:46.539
be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God.

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:50.699
Remember the Bible says about Judah in the book of Jeremiah that they forgot God days

00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:53.379
without number.

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:55.819
Could it not be said of America?

00:21:55.819 --> 00:22:02.819
Honestly, I'm broken for our nation this evening, but I believe the Bible has the answer for

00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:09.579
our nation this evening, but we must understand and we must acknowledge that our God is righteous

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.379
and that sin brings reproach.

00:22:12.379 --> 00:22:15.979
We understand this evening the pride in America.

00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:19.779
We understand this evening the murder, the drug abuse.

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:27.899
There were states in our nation that voted to legalize hardcore drugs.

00:22:27.899 --> 00:22:30.179
It's unbelievable.

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:31.819
It's wicked.

00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:33.859
It's ungodly.

00:22:33.859 --> 00:22:38.579
The Bible says that God will judge.

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:40.719
He is the righteous judge.

00:22:40.719 --> 00:22:43.499
I don't want judgment for our nation.

00:22:43.499 --> 00:22:46.619
I don't.

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:53.859
That's not what I would hope for our nation, but can I tell you that we're right for judgment.

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:56.859
But think about abortion.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:57.859
Think about fornication.

00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:02.179
I spoke about that a little bit this morning from Hebrews 13.

00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:03.179
Fornication and adultery.

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:08.299
I would submit to you this evening that the real problem in America with abortion is fornication.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:14.059
And if we deal with the sin of fornication, we might not have the fruit of abortion, or

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:17.979
at least it would be greatly diminished.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.179
I mean, we have problems in our nation.

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:21.179
Pornography.

00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:24.739
I mean, you just name all these things that are going on in our nation.

00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:26.939
It's horrible.

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:29.779
It's terrible.

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:31.219
Let me tell you just a few things.

00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:36.899
I don't have time to develop all of the book of Amos, but in Amos chapter number four,

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:41.259
the Bible says, hear this word, is how it starts in verse number one.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:45.539
But I want you to notice in verse number five, look at the last part of the verse.

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:49.559
It says, for this likeeth you, O you children of Israel, saith the Lord God.

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:52.879
And then it says in verse number six, and I also have given you cleanness of teeth in

00:23:52.879 --> 00:24:01.739
all your cities and want of bread in all your places, yet have ye not returned unto me,

00:24:01.739 --> 00:24:03.259
saith the Lord.

00:24:03.259 --> 00:24:07.259
There was famine, yet they did not return to the Lord.

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:11.659
There was drought in verses seven and eight, and yet the latter part of verse number eight

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:16.259
says, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:17.539
There was blight.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:21.019
That's the destruction of crops that is given to us in verse number nine.

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:24.179
In the end of verse number nine, it says, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:25.179
Lord.

00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:27.279
In verse number 10, there's pestilence.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:31.819
And yet the Bible says at the end of verse number 10, yet have ye not returned unto me,

00:24:31.819 --> 00:24:33.899
saith the Lord.

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:39.699
Verse number 11, he says, I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:41.059
Remember the text in 2 Peter?

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:42.499
Remember the text in Jude?

00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:44.659
The example of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:49.339
And he says, I've overthrown some of you in like manner as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:54.419
and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning, yet have ye not returned unto

00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:56.379
me, saith the Lord.

00:24:56.539 --> 00:25:02.659
Therefore, therefore, verse number 12, thus will I do unto thee, O Israel, and because

00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:09.659
I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:10.659
Those are heavy words.

00:25:10.659 --> 00:25:15.899
This is a heavy message that Amos has to deliver.

00:25:15.899 --> 00:25:21.019
And he's bringing this message, and really what we're finding in this message is that

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:24.099
sin brings reproach.

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:25.819
Sin brings shame.

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:33.419
Jeremiah, chapter number 2, in verse number 17, as we would think about some of what Jeremiah

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:38.419
would paint the picture of what's going on in Judah and help us understand, notice what

00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:41.179
he says in chapter 2 and verse number 17.

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:48.979
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God

00:25:48.979 --> 00:25:51.539
when He led thee by the way?

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:55.259
I worked a number of years in the procurement world.

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:58.419
That's what I did when I worked in corporate America.

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:01.379
I worked in supply chain procurement.

00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:06.499
And what Jeremiah is saying is that because of your actions, you have bought this, you

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:09.219
have brought this upon you.

00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:12.019
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself?

00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:17.399
Remember, I mentioned a moment ago that principle that we find in the Word of God, as Paul would

00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:23.699
put it so plainly in Galatians, chapter number 6, when he said, be not deceived.

00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:25.579
God is not mocked.

00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:29.059
For whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:33.459
Can I tell you, there is a positive side of that truth.

00:26:33.459 --> 00:26:38.619
You sow good seed, you reap good fruit.

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:40.299
There's a negative side.

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:46.259
You sow wicked seed, you're going to reap wicked fruit, evil fruit.

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:47.659
It's a principle of the Word of God.

00:26:47.659 --> 00:26:48.659
You're not going to change it.

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:49.659
It's a law.

00:26:49.659 --> 00:26:51.939
It's just not going to be changed.

00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:57.899
A preacher of yesteryear said, too many people are running around sowing wicked seeds all

00:26:57.899 --> 00:27:02.619
week long and then going to church on Sunday and praying for crop failure.

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:05.059
I thought that was pretty interesting.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:06.339
Because you know what?

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:14.739
It properly explains the approach of many today.

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:19.779
They sow seeds of wickedness and then they pray for crop failure.

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:20.779
Don't let it come.

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:21.779
Don't let it happen.

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:25.779
But God said, listen, God is not mocked.

00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:30.299
He says in Jeremiah 2.17, hast thou not procured this unto thyself?

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:40.299
Turn over to chapter 6 here in the book of Jeremiah and notice in verse number 15.

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:41.779
Great question that is asked here.

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:46.859
It says, were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:48.659
Nay.

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:51.259
They were not at all ashamed.

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:54.939
Where could they blush?

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:57.379
Therefore they shall fall among them that fall.

00:27:57.379 --> 00:28:02.259
The time that I visit them, they shall be cast down, saith the Lord.

00:28:02.259 --> 00:28:05.579
You know, we live in a time where they don't blush.

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:06.579
There's no shame.

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:09.459
I mean, they flaunt that wickedness.

00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:10.459
Do they not?

00:28:10.459 --> 00:28:15.299
I mean, they celebrate the wickedness.

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:19.699
They're legislating the wickedness.

00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:26.139
Jeremiah says, were they ashamed when they committed abomination?

00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:27.699
Nay.

00:28:27.699 --> 00:28:34.259
They were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.

00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:45.139
Jeremiah chapter 10, the first statement of verse number 3, for the customs of the people

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:47.539
are vain.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:51.119
The customs of the people are vain.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:57.779
If you study anthropology, you're studying various customs and world cultures and what

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:04.499
have you, and you begin to study the cultures and times and customs of various people groups.

00:29:04.499 --> 00:29:11.179
One of the classes that I least liked in Bible college was advanced cultural anthropology.

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:15.059
I said, I had a hard enough time in cultural anthropology, you make me take advanced cultural

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:17.259
anthropology.

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:20.859
And then they made us write a term paper, if you were going to be a missionary to Mars,

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.539
how would you take the gospel there?

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:23.539
Are you kidding me?

00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:26.179
That's what they made us do.

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:31.379
But, you know, you study customs, world customs, you know what he's saying?

00:29:31.379 --> 00:29:37.499
The customs of the people are vain.

00:29:37.499 --> 00:29:42.579
I understand this evening, if you take and go to the book of Jude, if you will, again,

00:29:42.579 --> 00:29:44.419
it's only one chapter.

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:50.059
We've mentioned already the truth of the warning, the example of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:51.059
in verse number 7.

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:55.779
I want you to consider the prophecy of Enoch.

00:29:55.779 --> 00:29:58.459
Jude references this in verses 14 and 15.

00:29:58.459 --> 00:30:04.299
When the Bible says this, and Enoch, also the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these

00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:05.299
saying,

00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:07.299
Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints.

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:10.979
Now, we understand that Enoch walked with God and was not, for God took him.

00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:13.819
What a great testimony that Enoch had.

00:30:13.819 --> 00:30:18.459
And the Bible says that he was prophesying, and what he's prophesying is that the Lord

00:30:18.459 --> 00:30:20.379
comes with ten thousand of his saints.

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:24.139
He's speaking about the second coming of Christ.

00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:28.739
Many today in our society, listen, they don't even have any awareness of this truth of the

00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:30.539
second coming of Christ.

00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:39.199
He came as a lamb to die the first time, but he's coming as the lion of the tribe of Judah.

00:30:39.199 --> 00:30:42.999
The Bible says, look at what it says in verse 15, why is he coming with ten thousands of

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:43.999
his saints?

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:52.439
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their

00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:59.119
ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their harsh speeches, which ungodly

00:30:59.119 --> 00:31:02.159
sinners have spoken against him.

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.879
He's getting right after it, isn't he?

00:31:05.879 --> 00:31:07.319
He's going to execute judgment.

00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:10.399
We understand this is at a future time.

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:16.279
Revelation 19 explains for us, gives us the picture of this second coming of Christ when

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:20.479
he comes at the end of the tribulation period.

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:23.279
The Bible says in verse number 11 of Revelation 19,

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:27.079
And I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:28.799
faithful and true.

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:36.039
And in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:40.479
The righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:42.879
Righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:31:42.879 --> 00:31:44.879
Sin is a reproach to any people.

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:48.559
The Bible says that in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:52.239
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name

00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:54.279
written that no man knew but he himself.

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:57.999
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of

00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.159
God.

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:03.319
The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen,

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:07.919
white and clean, and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:08.919
the nations.

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:12.679
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.839
and wrath of Almighty God.

00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:21.439
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.439
lords."

00:32:22.439 --> 00:32:27.519
Listen, he's coming back and he is going to execute righteous judgment.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:32.119
But I would submit to you this evening that each of those nations that we looked at, each

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:36.519
of those people groups that we referenced in Amos 1 and in the first eight verses of

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:42.839
Amos 2, they all received judgment before the Lord came back.

00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:46.839
And what I would submit to you this evening is that I understand that God will come back.

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:53.039
At the end of the seven-year tribulation period, He will come back and execute righteous judgment.

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:57.039
But I would submit to you this evening that there are plenty of folks that are judged

00:32:57.039 --> 00:33:01.159
before that time period comes.

00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:04.119
And again, America is ripe for judgment.

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:08.359
It breaks my heart to say that, it honestly does.

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:10.999
But we find that God is righteous.

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.679
Number two, sin is a reproach.

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.239
Sin brings reproach.

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:21.119
Number three, if you're taking notes, repentance is required.

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.119
Repentance is required.

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:24.359
What's the answer?

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:28.919
When you look at the wickedness of a people group, when you look at the announcement of

00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:31.279
judgment, what is the answer?

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.439
How do you spare judgment?

00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:35.039
How do you avoid the judgment?

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:40.279
How is it that we can come to the place where we acknowledge the fact that God Almighty

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:45.319
is righteous and that sin brings reproach, and we'd say this evening that as we look

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:50.399
at our beloved nation, that yes, our nation, because of the wickedness, because of the

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.159
sin, we're ripe for judgment.

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:55.159
Repentance is required.

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:58.359
Turn to the book of Jonah, if you will.

00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:08.759
Jonah chapter number three.

00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:15.239
In Jonah chapter number three, we find that Jonah, the prophet of God, has now gotten

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.919
right with God.

00:34:16.919 --> 00:34:22.839
It took a little detour into the belly of a great fish, but Jonah got right with God.

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:23.839
Amen?

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:27.319
And after Jonah got right with God and made some vows, we find in chapter number three

00:34:27.319 --> 00:34:31.319
that the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying, God's message to

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.119
Jonah didn't change, by the way.

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:35.879
Arise, go to Nineveh, and cry against it, right?

00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:39.719
He says, go into Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I did

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:40.719
thee.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:43.199
He didn't want to go to Nineveh in the first place.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.119
Chapter number one tells us all about his fleeing.

00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:47.839
He resisted the call of God.

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.799
He did not want to go to Nineveh.

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:55.279
But after God got a hold of Jonah and dealt with Jonah, Jonah made haste to get to Nineveh,

00:34:55.279 --> 00:34:56.279
did he not?

00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:59.399
The Bible tells us that Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh.

00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:02.239
It says that according to the word of the Lord, and now Nineveh was an exceeding great

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:03.679
city of three days' journey.

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:08.279
It's interesting that God gives us that truth in verse number three and then tells us in

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:13.139
verse number four, and Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey.

00:35:13.139 --> 00:35:15.559
He was going triple time.

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:20.939
In the military, I remember chatting with my brother, and they of course have their

00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:24.359
combat boots and all that sort of thing, but when they really got to go and they're in

00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:27.999
training and basic school and all that sort of thing, they'll put on sneakers and they

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:32.559
call them their go-fasters because you're going to go faster in those sneakers than

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:34.239
you are in those combat boots.

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:40.279
And the reality is that Jonah put on his running shoes or sandals, but he got there in a hurry,

00:35:40.279 --> 00:35:41.279
amen?

00:35:41.279 --> 00:35:45.079
It was a three days' journey, and on the first day journey, he's entering into the city and

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:46.079
he's preaching.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:54.679
He says this, and he cried and said, yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:57.719
Can I tell you that this message is simple?

00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:04.239
This is not a deep message that Jonah's delivering, but it's powerful.

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:08.559
I'm not in any way suggesting to you this evening that judgment is coming in America

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:10.199
in 40 days.

00:36:10.199 --> 00:36:14.679
Please do not leave here and misunderstand or misrepresent what I'm saying this evening.

00:36:14.679 --> 00:36:20.759
I'm saying for Nineveh that the message that God gave to Jonah to deliver to this people

00:36:20.759 --> 00:36:25.599
group was that in 40 days, there was going to be judgment, there was going to be destruction.

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:33.239
I believe with every fiber of my being that if these individuals would have mocked and

00:36:33.239 --> 00:36:41.439
scorned Jonah, that they would have been destroyed because God had announced judgment.

00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:45.559
They were not going to avoid it by mocking and scoffing.

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.559
Look at this preacher.

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:47.559
What does he think he's doing?

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:51.159
You understand what I'm saying?

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:56.559
God was going to bring judgment, but we notice the response.

00:36:56.559 --> 00:37:02.279
It's a response that is so important to understand this evening.

00:37:02.279 --> 00:37:06.199
It's a response of repentance.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:11.119
The Bible tells us in verse number five, so the people of Nineveh believed God.

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:13.479
Can I tell you that's where it starts?

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:15.039
You've got to believe God.

00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:21.719
You've got to believe that what God said is true, that what God has said in His Word is

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:23.679
actually true, that it's going to come.

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:29.719
So we have a responsibility as the people of God, as we would go out into the communities

00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:35.479
that God has called us to go into, to display to them the truth and power of the Word of

00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:36.999
God.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:41.839
And then the people, remember, as Paul went to Thessalonica, he said that he was rejoicing

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:45.839
because they received the Word of God in truth as it is.

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:52.239
Not the words of men, but they received it as it is in truth, the Word of God.

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:57.199
And here, these people in Nineveh, they believed God and they proclaimed a fast and they put

00:37:57.199 --> 00:38:00.799
on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

00:38:00.799 --> 00:38:04.959
Oh, wouldn't it be awesome if that happened in America?

00:38:04.959 --> 00:38:14.319
I mean, honestly, if some people would understand, it's not about a party affiliation.

00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:18.099
It's not about some soapbox that you want to deal with.

00:38:18.099 --> 00:38:21.239
It's about righteousness and wickedness.

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.939
We are engaged in a spiritual battle.

00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:26.759
The book of Ephesians lays it out quite plainly.

00:38:26.759 --> 00:38:31.899
In the sixth chapter, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, against spiritual wickedness

00:38:31.899 --> 00:38:33.239
and high places.

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:40.559
And can I tell you this evening that that spiritual battle is raging?

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:44.739
It's between righteousness and wickedness.

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:50.219
And so many people today are so caught up with a party affiliation or some other soapbox

00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:55.999
that they want to deal with and we're missing the main point.

00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:58.199
It's a spiritual battle.

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:01.439
And the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.439
They are mighty.

00:39:02.439 --> 00:39:03.439
They're spiritual.

00:39:03.439 --> 00:39:07.119
They're mighty to the pulling down of strongholds.

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:09.379
Is that not what the Word of God tells us?

00:39:09.379 --> 00:39:10.879
Put on the whole armor of God.

00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:14.999
We're to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:19.439
Notice, these people, they believed God and they repented.

00:39:19.439 --> 00:39:23.479
It says in verse 6, for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he rose from his throne.

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:27.239
He laid his robe from him, covered him with sackcloth and satin ashes.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:30.919
He caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king

00:39:30.919 --> 00:39:34.679
and his nobles saying, let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything.

00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:38.679
Let them not feed nor drink water, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:44.239
cry mightily unto God, yea, let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:46.799
that is in their hands.

00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:52.759
Who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish

00:39:52.759 --> 00:39:53.759
not?

00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:58.559
I'm so glad this evening that our God is righteous but that our God is ready to part.

00:39:58.559 --> 00:40:02.559
He is gracious and merciful.

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:05.079
He's ready to forgive.

00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:08.199
And that's a great truth of the Word of God.

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:14.279
And here, the Bible says that they proclaim this fast, that they have this time of repentance,

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:17.999
that everyone would turn from his evil way, from the violence that is in their hands.

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:24.479
And the Bible tells us that judgment is spared in verse number 10, and God saw their works,

00:40:24.479 --> 00:40:26.959
that they turned from their evil way.

00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:33.599
God repented the evil that he had said that he would do unto them, and he did it not.

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:37.039
Forty days later on the calendar, judgment didn't come for Nineveh.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:38.039
Why?

00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:41.159
Because of their proper response.

00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:42.839
God is righteous.

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:46.799
Sin brings reproach, but repentance is required.

00:40:46.799 --> 00:40:48.319
The Bible has the answer.

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:53.039
We understand, we often say that the Bible has the answer for every question of life.

00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:57.559
You might have to dig in, but it does.

00:40:57.559 --> 00:40:59.279
What's the answer for America?

00:40:59.279 --> 00:41:00.279
Revival.

00:41:00.279 --> 00:41:01.279
Repentance.

00:41:01.279 --> 00:41:03.599
Believing God.

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:08.479
Turning from our wicked ways, so that judgment might be spared.

00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:12.599
Let me finish with a passage in the book of Ezra.

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:16.719
Turn to the book of Ezra, if you will.

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:21.519
I know we've gone to a number of places this evening, and if you missed any of the references,

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:28.439
the message will be on YouTube later, or you can ask me for notes.

00:41:28.439 --> 00:41:36.719
In Ezra chapter number 9, there's a great passage of Scripture that deals with revival.

00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:40.439
The Bible says in verse number 1 of Ezra 9,

00:41:40.439 --> 00:41:43.679
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,

00:41:43.679 --> 00:41:46.679
The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:51.039
the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites,

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:54.679
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians,

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:55.679
and the Amorites.

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:59.519
For they have taken up their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the

00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:02.719
holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands.

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:06.839
Yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:13.879
Verse 3, And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off

00:42:13.879 --> 00:42:18.999
the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down a stone-eyed.

00:42:18.999 --> 00:42:22.559
Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel,

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:26.919
because of the transgression of those that had been carried away, and I sat a stone-eyed

00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:29.359
until the evening sacrifice.

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:34.599
Verse 5, It says, And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness, and having rent

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:40.119
my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God,

00:42:40.119 --> 00:42:48.399
and said, O my God, Notice what he says, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:56.839
thee, my God, for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up

00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:57.839
unto the heavens.

00:42:57.839 --> 00:43:03.759
I wonder this evening which one among us would respond the way that Ezra did.

00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:13.559
I mean honestly, that when we hear this, that our heart is heavy, I don't long for America

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:14.799
to be judged.

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:17.519
I don't hope for America to be judged.

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:19.439
I really don't.

00:43:19.439 --> 00:43:24.359
I'm simply giving you this evening truth from the Word of God, that the righteous God, the

00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:30.039
righteous Lord, loveth righteousness, that righteousness exalteth the nation, but sin

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:32.139
is a reproach to any people.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:37.159
The Bible told us as we looked, and we made mention there, and I wish I could quote it

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:41.119
for you, I did not commit it to memory, but in Psalm 9, as I've turned back there a couple

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:45.159
of times in verse number 17, the wicked shall be turned into hell in all the nations that

00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:46.519
forget God.

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:50.319
I don't want that for our nation.

00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:54.639
I'm not preaching this message because I hope that judgment comes.

00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:59.839
I understand that Jonah went to Nineveh, and then after they repented and they were spared,

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:02.199
that he was upset.

00:44:02.199 --> 00:44:03.199
I understand.

00:44:03.199 --> 00:44:05.559
I've read, I've preached the book of Jonah before.

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.599
I understand the fourth chapter.

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:16.239
And I tell you this evening, as much as I could say this with knowing what I know, if

00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:19.839
our nation would repent, I would rejoice greatly.

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:24.439
Honestly, I don't want there to be judgment.

00:44:24.439 --> 00:44:28.079
And I just wonder when we hear these things, when we see these things around us, when we're

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:35.159
aware of what's going on, who among us will respond like Ezra, in heaviness, in brokenness,

00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:39.439
lifting up our face to the Lord and saying, our iniquities are increased over our head.

00:44:39.439 --> 00:44:41.639
They are.

00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:45.519
We're living in a wicked land.

00:44:45.519 --> 00:44:49.239
Verse 7, since the days of our fathers have we been in great trespass unto this day.

00:44:49.239 --> 00:44:52.639
And for our iniquities have we, our kings and our priests, been delivered into the hand

00:44:52.639 --> 00:44:57.639
of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to a spoil, to confusion of face

00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:00.319
as it is this day.

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:05.139
Now for a little space, grace hath been showed from the Lord our God to leave us a remnant

00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:10.099
to escape and to give us a nail in His holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes and

00:45:10.099 --> 00:45:12.379
give us a little reviving in our bondage.

00:45:12.379 --> 00:45:17.819
I understand we're not in bondage to another nation and all that sort of thing, I understand.

00:45:17.819 --> 00:45:24.339
But I'm wondering this evening how it is that we respond, how it is that we look at a message

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:27.579
like this and we understand that our God is righteous.

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:30.959
Listen, that's never going to change.

00:45:30.959 --> 00:45:33.939
No one is going to change that our God is righteous.

00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:39.219
I don't care who gets in power, I don't care what they legislate, they are never going

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:43.459
to change the truth that our God is righteous.

00:45:43.459 --> 00:45:49.339
Nor will they ever change that the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:54.059
Nor will they ever change that righteousness exalteth a nation.

00:45:54.059 --> 00:46:01.019
They can continue down the path of sin and immorality and wickedness and shake their

00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:07.499
fist at God, but God said sin is a reproach to any people.

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:14.259
This evening, our beloved nation is ripe for judgment and it breaks my heart to say that.

00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:18.539
I'd say this, it's been that way for a long time, by the way.

00:46:18.539 --> 00:46:22.379
We've been on a slippery slope for a long time.

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:28.539
And it's almost as if apart from God, that snowball on that slippery slope has gotten

00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:33.419
so large, it's completely out of control.

00:46:33.419 --> 00:46:35.139
But God.

00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:36.139
But God.

00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:45.099
Oh, that someone would stand with a measure of boldness to proclaim a message that yes,

00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:52.139
our God is the righteous judge, but He is a God that is full of compassion and grace

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:56.539
and mercy and He's ready to pardon and He's ready to forgive.

00:46:56.539 --> 00:47:01.419
Oh, that we'd understand we need to repent.

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:05.819
Our nation needs to repent because repentance is required.

00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:12.379
Tonight, the righteous Lord, He loveth righteousness.

00:47:12.379 --> 00:47:18.299
I'm so thankful for the truth of God's word, for the power of God's word.

00:47:18.299 --> 00:47:22.499
And this evening, my heart is heavy for our nation.

00:47:22.499 --> 00:47:25.659
And I tell you that my heart's heavy for our nation not because of the result of an

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:26.659
election.

00:47:26.659 --> 00:47:29.419
It really isn't.

00:47:29.419 --> 00:47:37.539
A heart is heavy for our nation because of wickedness, because of sin and ill morality,

00:47:37.539 --> 00:47:41.179
because sin is a reproach to any people.

00:47:41.179 --> 00:47:47.299
And if we understand the word of God the way that we do, we ought to be broken.

00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:54.419
First for our own sin and next for the sin of our nation and plead with God and then

00:47:54.419 --> 00:47:59.099
do our part to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:00.379
Father, we love you.

00:48:00.379 --> 00:48:02.859
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:02.859 --> 00:48:04.859
Thank you for the truth of thy word.

00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:10.259
God, I pray that you'd move in hearts and lives tonight.

00:48:10.259 --> 00:48:12.699
Help us to respond as Ezra did.

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:13.699
I think of Nehemiah.

00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:19.699
When Nehemiah won, when he received the report, he was broken.

00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:27.939
He prayed because he heard the condition of his homeland.

00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:34.219
This evening we did not go into details and provide statistics, but we understand this

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:39.379
evening that our beloved nation is in trouble.

00:48:39.379 --> 00:48:42.939
Wickedness and evil, immorality.

00:48:42.939 --> 00:48:46.859
They call evil good and good evil.

00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:54.619
They promote, celebrate wickedness, even legislate wickedness.

00:48:54.619 --> 00:49:01.499
God, I pray you'd help us to see revival.

00:49:01.499 --> 00:49:07.619
That we would be so passionate about the message of thy word that we would preach it in power

00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:09.619
and in truth.

00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:17.179
The Holy Spirit of God would convict and convince the hearers that thy word is truth.

00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:24.059
There would be a great moving of God, revival in our land.

00:49:24.059 --> 00:49:25.699
I believe it's possible.

00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:28.139
God, I pray that you'd work.

00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:31.299
Have your will and way in these few moments of invitation.

00:49:31.299 --> 00:49:33.619
In Christ's name we pray.

00:49:33.619 --> 00:49:34.619
Would you stand with me?

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:36.619
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:41.339
Kimberly is going to play quietly on the piano and as she does, the altar is open.

00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:43.299
Maybe you just want to come and pray for our nation tonight.

00:49:43.299 --> 00:49:49.539
Maybe you want to come and make a commitment of your involvement on praying for our nation,

00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:53.419
of proclaiming the gospel message.

00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:58.339
I don't want judgment, but I believe based upon the principles of the word of God.

00:49:58.339 --> 00:50:01.899
But our nation is ripe for judgment.

00:50:01.899 --> 00:50:02.899
I pray that it would be spared.

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:05.179
It's going to require repentance.

00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:07.459
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
