1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
And all the way in the back of your Bible, just before the book of Revelation, and it's

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,079
just a short chapter, but honestly, if you're to read through these 25 verses of this short

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:18,319
letter, you could do it in just a matter of minutes, but the truth that is contained in

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:26,319
this book is powerful and so important that we just understand the importance of all of

5
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,520
God's Word.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,659
We're going to go near the end of this particular letter and look at verses 22 and 23 this evening.

7
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,299
As you see there in your bulletin, the title comes from verse number 23, but look at these

8
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:48,020
two verses here, Jude says in verse 22, and of some have compassion making a difference,

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:58,299
and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted

10
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,299
by the flesh.

11
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,139
I've titled the message, Pulling Them Out of the Fire.

12
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:09,699
There are many hymns that we sing, of course, that remind us of the importance of preaching

13
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:14,019
the gospel, and what a blessing to think about those hymns.

14
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:18,019
We mentioned a couple of them this morning as we looked at that portion of scripture,

15
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,099
the power of the gospel, and I mentioned to you this morning that I would be reading a

16
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:28,300
couple of passages that are written from some individuals, some hymn stories, if you will,

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,940
and this first one is with the familiar hymn.

18
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,620
It's in our songbooks, number 671, Rescue the Perishing, and what a great song that

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,940
is, rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, aren't you thankful for

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:51,220
the mercy of our Lord, and we find that this particular hymn story comes from barryhymns.com,

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,779
and he says this, in days when reaching the lost seemed to be more of a priority for most

22
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:03,699
believers, many hymn writers and evangelists would use the sea to illustrate the sin in

23
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,620
which the lost were drowning.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:13,899
I read that first statement to you this morning, and I wonder when it is and why it is that

25
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:19,979
we have not placed as much of a priority on reaching the lost with the gospel, and you

26
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:26,179
see that he makes that statement that in days when, days gone by when reaching the lost

27
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,820
seemed to be more of a priority for most believers.

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,139
He says this, they would then refer to things such as lighthouses and lifelines as the gospel

29
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,800
which was needed to rescue drowning mankind.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,580
Such was the case with the prolific blind hymn writer, Fanny Crosby.

31
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,660
We know much about Fanny Crosby, and she penned the words to this particular song, Rescue

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,899
the Perishing.

33
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:52,020
Of course, there are times in which we sing some of the hymns and we don't know the story

34
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,580
behind the hymn, and this particular account is given from an individual that had firsthand

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,380
knowledge that he received directly from Fanny Crosby with regard to the words of

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,940
this great hymn.

37
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,699
It was written in the year 1869 when I was 49 years old.

38
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,220
Many of my hymns were written after experiences in New York Mission work.

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,860
This one was thus written, I was addressing a large company of working men one hot summer

40
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,860
evening when the thought kept forcing itself on my mind that some mother's boy must be

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,460
rescued that night or not at all.

42
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,300
So I made a pressing plea that if there was a boy present who had wandered from his mother's

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,619
home and teaching, he would come to me at the close of the service.

44
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:46,660
A young man of 18 years came forward and said, did you mean me?

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,660
I promised my mother to meet her in heaven, but as I'm now living, that will be impossible.

46
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,100
We prayed for him and he finally arose with a new light in his eyes and exclaimed in triumph,

47
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,020
now I can meet my mother in heaven for I have found God.

48
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,580
A few days before, Mr. Doan, the musical composer, had sent me the subject, Rescue the Perishing.

49
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,779
While I sat there that evening, that line came to me, rescue the perishing, care for

50
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,779
the dying.

51
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,540
I could think of nothing else that night.

52
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,579
When I arrived home, I went to work on the hymn at once.

53
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,220
Before I retired, it was ready for the melody.

54
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,459
The next day, my song was written out and forwarded to Mr. Doan, who wrote the beautiful

55
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,019
and touching music as it now stands to my hymn.

56
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:38,380
In November of 1903, I went to Lynn, Massachusetts to speak before the Young Men's Christian

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,380
Association.

58
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,500
I told them the incident that led to me writing Rescue the Perishing as I have just related

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
it.

60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,540
After the meeting, a large number of men shook hands with me, and among them was a man who

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,940
seemed to be deeply moved.

62
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,980
You may imagine my surprise when he said, Ms. Crosby, I was the boy who told you more

63
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,859
than 35 years ago that I had wandered from my mother's God.

64
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,459
The evening that you spoke at the mission, I saw and found peace, and I have tried to

65
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:11,679
live a consistent Christian life ever since.

66
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:18,660
If we never meet again on earth, we will meet up yonder, he said to her.

67
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,019
He raised my hand to his lips, and before I had recovered from my surprise, he had gone

68
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,579
and remains to this day a nameless friend who touched a deep chord of sympathy in my

69
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,940
heart.

70
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,019
Times have changed, but mankind is still drowning in the sea of sin.

71
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:40,100
The gospel has not changed, and it can still rescue and save mankind.

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,079
Those who are drowning are headed for spiritual death.

73
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,260
It must still be our desire and goal to share the gospel, which alone can rescue them.

74
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:55,739
May we do our part to rescue the perishing with a renewed spirit and fervor.

75
00:05:55,739 --> 00:06:00,899
Another song that might not be as familiar, we do not sing it as often.

76
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:06,299
It's number 669 in our hymnal, Throw Out the Lifeline.

77
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,540
Throw out the lifeline.

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,619
And this particular song, which points out that the gospel message should motivate us

79
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,700
to help others by seeking and saving the lost, throw out the lifeline.

80
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,779
This individual, Ufford, who wrote this particular hymn, he would visit Nantucket Beach, a particularly

81
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,019
dangerous coastal area where many ships had been destroyed on the rocks.

82
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:35,019
He was a Baptist preacher, and it is said that the local life-saving station at Point

83
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,619
Allerton had a Lyle gun, and that Lyle gun would be used to shoot out a lifeline to ships

84
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:41,619
that were in need.

85
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:46,339
It was in 1886, while they were watching a life-saving drill and could see some of

86
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:51,339
the previous wrecks, a friend of his recounted a scene, which was also reported in the Boston

87
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:56,579
Globe, where a schooner was being tossed in a storm, which threatened to smash it.

88
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:03,019
The lifeline was shot out several times, but fell short until finally it reached the vessel

89
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,459
and enabled the men to haul the ship in.

90
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,459
The title, Throw Out the Lifeline, stuck in Ufford's mind, so he went home, took out

91
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,399
a pencil, and had the words in ten minutes.

92
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,299
The song emphasized, of course, the importance of sharing the gospel, and I'm not going to

93
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:23,579
take the time to read both of these particular hymns, but you can read them, you can look

94
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,220
them up and find them quite easily.

95
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,299
But I think about this, and this particular hymn story comes from hymnstudiesblog.com,

96
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:39,260
and the author of this particular background of this hymn, Throw Out the Lifeline, concludes

97
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,619
by saying this, if we were to see a person drowning in the sea, we would try to do something

98
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:46,619
about it.

99
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:51,739
I mean, it's pretty easy for us to relate to that and understand what this particular

100
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,079
writer is saying.

101
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,579
He then uses the analogy that if we were to see a person trapped in a burning building,

102
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,980
we would try to do something about it.

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
What is it?

104
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,019
It's our compassion for fellow human beings that would motivate us to help them in some

105
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,519
way or another.

106
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,720
How much more important is a person's spiritual condition than his physical life?

107
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Therefore, when we see a person lost in sin, our compassion for his soul should motivate

108
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,239
us to throw out the lifeline.

109
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:30,320
You think about these two hymns, and of course we could mention a number of others this evening,

110
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,359
but there are many hymns that we sing about send the light, about I love to tell the story,

111
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,440
I mentioned that at the conclusion of the message this morning, and many others that

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,599
we could note.

113
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,799
But as we think about the responsibility that we have in really entering into our missions

114
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,640
conference, and it starts on Saturday, and being in prayer for those that would be with

115
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,479
us, I want us to focus, as we will be challenged no doubt during our missions conference, on

116
00:08:56,479 --> 00:09:01,640
how it is that we can have some part in reaching the world with the gospel.

117
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,320
I'm so thankful for the privilege that is ours to give to missions.

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,719
I'm thankful that God has called laborers and sent forth laborers to go into the mission

119
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:17,080
field and to go and take the gospel, and what a unique privilege is ours to be engaged in

120
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,200
and involved in helping them, assisting them complete that task that God has assigned them

121
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
to.

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,760
But the reality, as I've said often throughout the years, is that there is no light on our

123
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,200
map, there is no picture on our map of Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton, Virginia.

124
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,859
Because we are the light.

125
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:43,400
We are the ones that are responsible for reaching this region with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

126
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:50,840
We find that God Almighty has divinely placed us here for such a time as this.

127
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,320
I believe that.

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,239
And it's a unique opportunity that we have, as we think about these verses of Scripture

129
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,599
in the book of Jude, we find that He says,

130
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,639
have compassion, making a difference. We're mindful of the compassion of our

131
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,019
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and even as he walked upon this earth during his

132
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,199
earthly ministry, many times the scriptures would tell us that he was

133
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:17,639
moved with compassion upon them or on them, and we find that that would result

134
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,539
in some action being taken. We looked on Wednesday evening, this past Wednesday

135
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,879
night, before we got to Acts 13, we examined Matthew 9 when the Bible says

136
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,519
that Jesus, when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, and

137
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,179
then of course he said that we're to pray to the Lord of the harvest that he

138
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,859
would send forth laborers into his harvest. Why? Because he said that the

139
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:46,959
harvest is plenteous, but the laborers, they are few, and no doubt we, as we would

140
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,739
exercise a measure of compassion upon individuals, that we can make a

141
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:59,319
difference in people's lives. Someone said, and I believe there's great truth

142
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:03,799
to the statement, that people don't care how much you know until they know how

143
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:10,239
much you care. I believe that that truth is best illustrated through the life and

144
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:15,239
ministry of the Apostle Paul to the believers in Thessalonica. We find that

145
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,559
as he would come to that city in Thessalonica, and then he would later

146
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,779
write to them in the book of 1 Thessalonians, he makes specific

147
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,039
statement with regard to his care for them, and he likens it to the care of a

148
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,579
mother. He says, where we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth

149
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,119
her children. And I find that this evening it is important that we would be

150
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:46,539
compassionate, that we'd understand that man is blinded by the enemy, and that we

151
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:53,479
too were once in that same condition. Amen? Of some have compassion making a

152
00:11:53,479 --> 00:12:02,799
difference. And we notice in verse number 23, and others save with fear pulling

153
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,639
them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. As I think

154
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,719
about verse number 23, and I think about that phrase pulling them out of the fire,

155
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:17,859
and I am mindful of that last hymn story that I read to you of throw out

156
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:22,899
the lifeline, and just the the illustration of what was done, and how

157
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:28,239
that particular man observed the drill taking place, and that Lyle gun that

158
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:35,019
would shoot that lifeline out to those people that were stranded. When we were

159
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,259
not long ago, we're there in the Outer Banks, we had the opportunity to see some

160
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,159
of those life-saving stations, not only those, but of course the lighthouses, and

161
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,599
I chatted with an individual that had a just a vast amount of knowledge about

162
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:56,599
life there, and he was a little older and had lived there for a long time, and began

163
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:02,959
sharing some things with me about these life-saving stations. And basically, as

164
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,959
they would sit upon the shore, and they would see a ship that was just being

165
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:14,019
tossed to and fro, and definitely coming to a place of shipwreck, that the only

166
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:19,499
hope, he said, those people are going to die. And the only hope was to send out

167
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:24,659
that lifeline from that Lyle gun, and that it would reach far enough so that

168
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:30,299
some could be rescued. He said that they would practice, and they would go through

169
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,979
this process, and they would seek to be as proficient as possible in getting

170
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,599
that lifeline out. And the reality is that in some cases, it was not a safe

171
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:45,159
thing for them to try to travel to the particular area of the wreckage, and if

172
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,319
the particular sailors would stay with the wreckage, it was definite

173
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:52,919
that they would die. And if that line would get there, they would tie it off,

174
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,079
and they'd have to hand over hand make themselves safe, or bring themselves to

175
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,839
safety, back to shore. And begin to think about this verse of Scripture pulling

176
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,019
them out of fire, and just thinking about the reality of having the

177
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,419
gospel, and being able to share the gospel with those that we come into

178
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,079
contact with. And really just two simple thoughts this evening. Number one, the

179
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,259
reality of eternity. I mentioned this briefly this morning, but when we

180
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:25,019
understood the perspective of the Apostle Paul, and how that was born out

181
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,339
of his understanding as to what was at stake, and that is the reality of

182
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,839
eternity. Man is going to die, the Bible says, as it appointed unto man, once to

183
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,359
die, and after this the judgment. And we find that each individual that we come

184
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:48,039
into contact with, one day they are going to stand before God Almighty. It's just a

185
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,139
certainty of the Bible. It's the reality of eternity. And as we would think about

186
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,759
the reality of eternity, and we think about those judgments that God gives to

187
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,499
us in His Word, we find that there's the bema seat of Christ, the judgment seat

188
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:06,499
of Christ. And that's the judgment that if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

189
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:11,679
you'll stand there at that judgment. We'll give an account, and I'm thankful

190
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,139
that the other judgment that is mentioned is the great white throne

191
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:21,219
judgment. But I, because of being saved, and you, if you've trusted Christ as your

192
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:26,199
Savior, we do not have to stand before God Almighty at the great white throne

193
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,419
judgment. And for that I'm thankful. I'm thankful that the wrath of God Almighty

194
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:36,379
was poured upon the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, and that He paid

195
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:42,279
for my sin. And I don't have to stand at that great white throne judgment, but the

196
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,699
reality is that every person that we meet is going to stand before God. They're

197
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,199
going to stand before God, at either the judgment seat of Christ, or the great

198
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,819
white throne. I would say this, that most of the individuals that we come into

199
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:02,979
contact with are going to stand before God at the great white throne. They're going to

200
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:07,419
stand before God at the great white throne. The books are going to be opened.

201
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:12,819
The Bible says that death and hell were cast in the lake of fire. This is the

202
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:19,179
second death. Prior to that, in Revelation 20, and that's verse 15, and prior to that,

203
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,979
the Bible speaks about those that are redeemed, in which the second death has

204
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:30,619
no power over us. I'm so thankful for that. But this evening, this thing of

205
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:35,219
eternity is real. As we think about the reality of eternity, I think about the

206
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:40,259
responsibility to evangelize, and how we must get involved, if you're taking notes

207
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,619
number two, the responsibility to evangelize, we must get involved

208
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:48,259
personally in reaching souls with the gospel. As we would begin to think about

209
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,859
the responsibility that we have as individuals, and we begin to think about

210
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:56,499
even as we preached last Sunday night about being the light, and let your light

211
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,899
shine, and you're the light of the world, and what a blessing to understand the

212
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,099
responsibility that we have. But we'd understand even as we study throughout

213
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,459
the Word of God, and look at the the missionary journeys, and look at the

214
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,659
particular churches that were established, you will find that from

215
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,059
those local churches, those individuals went out and shared the gospel. I

216
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,219
mentioned earlier about the church in Thessalonica, and what Paul commented

217
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:25,899
with regard to his practice there, and the way in which he cared for those

218
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:29,099
individuals, but you'll be mindful in the first chapter of the book of 1st

219
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:34,819
Thessalonians, that the Word of God tells us that Paul really is commending them,

220
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,379
in 1st Thessalonians 1 and verse 8, and he says,

221
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:42,139
"...from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but

222
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:46,339
also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need

223
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:51,219
not to speak to anything." And so what is he saying? He's saying from this church

224
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:57,899
in Thessalonica, they understood their responsibility to evangelize. We studied

225
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:02,259
this morning in Romans chapter number 1, and what great truth Paul gives us with

226
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,499
regard to his own personal understanding, but you understand that the Bible says

227
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:10,859
in verse number 8 of Romans 1, "...first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you

228
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:17,979
all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world." We find that

229
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:24,179
there are individuals that understand this responsibility, and we must

230
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,299
get involved personally. It's a blessing to me when I have the opportunity, and I

231
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,459
know we live in a very populated area, and so it's not very often that we

232
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:38,139
bump into the same person in the same week. It's just so many people in our

233
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:44,380
area, and I've spoken to some pastors that pastor in much smaller areas, and in

234
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,659
fact, I spoke to a man on Tuesday at a pastor's meeting, and I asked him how

235
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,259
many were in the place where he was ministering. I never even heard of the

236
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,819
place here in Virginia where he's a pastor, and I said, I'm sorry, I've

237
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:57,899
never heard of it. Where is it? You know, how many people are there? He said, well,

238
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:04,859
in our entire county, there's about 5,000 people. I said, I think there

239
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,979
were that many at Walmart yesterday. That's how I felt anyway, man. But the

240
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:13,619
reality is that there are some places like that where the likelihood of coming

241
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,219
into contact with the same person the same week is higher than it would be

242
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:22,619
here. But there have been times over these last almost 10 years that I have taken

243
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,539
out a gospel tract, and I've sought to give it to an individual, and they've

244
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,339
said, I just got one of those from someone. And I find that someone from

245
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:37,299
within our church gave them a gospel tract and invited them to read the

246
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:43,339
truth of the gospel, and it encourages me. It's a blessing to me when we have

247
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:46,539
the privilege of seeing that. I had someone call me from Office Depot a few

248
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,579
years ago, and they said, hey, I just want to let you know that someone was in here

249
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,779
and they gave me a gospel tract, and I just appreciate that there's a church

250
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:01,619
that has a pastor that cares enough about reaching...

251
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:05,299
people that not only does he encourage people to do it, but he supplies gospel tracts.

252
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,379
That's what the person said to me on the phone.

253
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:10,579
Now I thought they were going to complain about the fact that somebody had left a gospel

254
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:14,819
tract at Office Depot, so I was getting all prepared for the conversation of, you know,

255
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,979
you're not allowed to be bringing this stuff in and all this sort of thing, but then they

256
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:23,099
thanked me, and it was refreshing, it was encouraging, and I was rejoicing at the end

257
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,459
of that conversation.

258
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:31,179
But what it is is that each individual has to understand that we have a responsibility

259
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,079
personally to reach individuals with the gospel.

260
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,739
And I want you to think about really three portions of Scripture this evening, and we're

261
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:47,859
going to go back to 2 Kings chapter number 7 with this thought of our responsibility,

262
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:48,859
pulling them out of the fire.

263
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:52,299
I want you to go back to 2 Kings 7, we're going to look at a passage there, we're going

264
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,579
to go to the book of Proverbs and then conclude in Acts chapter number 20, but I want you

265
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:03,059
to look at 2 Kings chapter number 7, and just even as I stated that passage of Scripture,

266
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:09,399
perhaps someone was already mindful of what takes place here in this particular passage.

267
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:15,979
You find that it's here that Elisha makes that declaration with regard to all that was

268
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:22,099
taking place with their lack of food and supply being taken care of, and that servant responds

269
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:26,519
about even if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be, and so on

270
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,519
and so forth.

271
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:34,339
But we find that God is going to work and God is going to provide, but within the story

272
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:39,579
there's another story, and it's the story of these leprous men.

273
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:44,819
And in 2 Kings 7, the Bible says in verse 3, and there were four leprous men at the

274
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,139
entering into the gate, and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?

275
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:54,779
So they go through this process of if we stay here we're going to die, if we stay

276
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,419
here we're going to die, we don't have any food, and we're leprous, and if we go

277
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:02,979
to the Syrians there's a possibility that we would have the opportunity to have grace

278
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,539
in their eyes and we might live, and so on and so forth, and so they make the decision

279
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:12,220
to go, and without them knowing, the Lord, according to verse number 6, had made the

280
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,940
host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, even the noise of a

281
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,339
great host, and they said one to another, lo, the king of Israel hath hired against

282
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:26,379
us the king of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us, wherefore

283
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:31,419
they, that's the Syrians, they arose and fled in the twilight, they left their tents,

284
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,539
their horses, their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

285
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:39,220
The same time that that's happening, these four leprous men are saying, hey, let's,

286
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,979
you know, what's the point of staying here, let's go.

287
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:48,500
Verse 8, and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into

288
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,379
one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and raiment and went

289
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,779
and hid it, and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went

290
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,339
and hid it.

291
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,059
They find great spoil.

292
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,459
I mean, can you imagine?

293
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:10,379
These four leprous men, they go to the place, the camp of the Syrians and they find that

294
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,500
there's no one there, but all of the supplies are there.

295
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,139
I mean, everything, they left it all.

296
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:21,259
And they said, man, this is great, but I want you to notice what they say in verse number

297
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:31,099
9, then they said one to another, we do not well.

298
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:35,419
Why was it that they reached this conclusion?

299
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,299
We do not well, why?

300
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:46,099
This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.

301
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,539
If we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us.

302
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:57,019
Now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household.

303
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,019
They said we do not well.

304
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,819
See, they came upon a great amount of spoil.

305
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:05,619
There were people that were dying of hunger.

306
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,220
And they had found great substance.

307
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,779
And they went into one tent, the Bible tells us in verse number 8, and they ate, they drank,

308
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,899
they carried then silver and gold raiment, went and hid it, and then they came into another

309
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:18,899
tent.

310
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,220
There's only so much that these four men could eat and drink of themselves, there's only

311
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,779
so much that they could hide.

312
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,739
And they go into that next tent and together they say, we do not well.

313
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,779
We do not well, why?

314
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:37,779
This day is a day of good tidings, and notice, we hold our peace.

315
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:44,220
We need to go back, and we need to go, notice where it says that we may go and tell the

316
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,419
king's household.

317
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,059
Now here's the amazing thing.

318
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:54,139
They couldn't make anyone of the nation of Israel go to find the spoil.

319
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:59,139
All they could do is go and tell them as to what they found, right?

320
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,139
They couldn't make them go.

321
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,739
In fact, the Bible tells us in verse number 10, so they came and called unto the porter

322
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:07,179
of the city, and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,

323
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,979
there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied and asses tied in the tents

324
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,220
as they were.

325
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,139
And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's house within.

326
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,179
Notice what the king says in verse number 12.

327
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,139
He arose in the night and said unto the servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have

328
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,380
done to us.

329
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,500
They know that we be hungry, therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves

330
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,699
in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and

331
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:31,699
get into the city.

332
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,699
What's he doing?

333
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,459
He's objecting to going to where the food is.

334
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,179
Oh, they've set up a trap.

335
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,739
I mean, they're going to, they've hid themselves.

336
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,940
They know that we're hungry, and we come, and they've lured us in, and then they're

337
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,339
going to come and conquer us.

338
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:48,899
Well, you can believe what you want, but we just went into the tents, and we got food.

339
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:49,899
Right?

340
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:53,380
I mean, can you see these four leprous men?

341
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,380
And as I look at this passage of Scripture, if I could draw an application to sharing

342
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,220
the gospel, we have found the light.

343
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,540
We have found the truth.

344
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,619
And if our gospel be hid, Paul said as I mentioned this morning, it is hid to them that are lost,

345
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:16,220
I would say this evening, then in a much more important fashion, even as the writer said

346
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,019
of that last hymn that I read, that hymn story, if we found somebody that was drowning, if

347
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,260
we found somebody in a burning building, but how much more important when we think

348
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,459
about the souls of mankind, and I would say to you this evening that if we have found

349
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:38,059
the truth, and we are not sharing it, we do not well.

350
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,699
Period.

351
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:40,859
End of story.

352
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,500
We do not well.

353
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,380
Why?

354
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:52,699
Because we know the truth, and we know the Savior, and we know what He offers.

355
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:59,419
They, these lepers, all they could do is go and tell.

356
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:04,699
They couldn't make anyone come to any tent of Assyrian.

357
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:05,699
That's all they could do is go and tell.

358
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:06,699
And you know what?

359
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:10,859
All the Lord requires of us is to go and tell.

360
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:12,979
To go and tell.

361
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:19,619
He gives us the truth, and then He entrusts us with that truth to go and tell others.

362
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,619
I can't force anyone to be saved, and neither can you.

363
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,019
But oh, that we would go and tell them.

364
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:32,820
That we would make it known that we would not hold our peace.

365
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,100
If you look at the remainder of this passage, and we're going to move on, but you find that

366
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,339
they find it just as the four lepers said the people went out and spoiled the tents

367
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:47,299
according to verse number 16, so that a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two

368
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,899
measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, just as Elisha had

369
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,699
prophesied in verse number 1.

370
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:58,660
And I understand the physical aspect of this particular account, but I draw the spiritual

371
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,260
application for us this evening.

372
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,220
We do not well if we hold our peace.

373
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,660
We need to go and tell.

374
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,979
This is what's over in the book of Proverbs, if you will, in Proverbs chapter number 24.

375
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:15,139
I believe in these couple of verses of Scripture in Proverbs 24, that there's an obvious application

376
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:20,260
for us in these verses with regard to sharing the gospel.

377
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:26,059
The Bible says in Proverbs 24, verse number 11,

378
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,100
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be

379
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,859
slain, if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not, doth not he that pondereth the heart

380
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,460
consider it?

381
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,219
And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?

382
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:50,659
And shall not he render to every man according to his works?

383
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:54,460
I believe that there's a spiritual application here as well, just as there was in 2 Kings

384
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,059
7, that we'd understand this word forbear is used in verse number 11, if thou forbear

385
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:05,940
to deliver them that are drawn unto death, it means to procrastinate or to refrain.

386
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,059
And we understand that this evening, that it's easier for us to make excuses than for

387
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,539
us to just do what we're supposed to do.

388
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:20,820
Because notice what he says in verse number 12, if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not.

389
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,380
It's easy for us to make excuses, it really is.

390
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,779
It's easy for me to make excuses.

391
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,380
I sat in my office this afternoon, in fact, Holly and I have had a couple of conversations

392
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,700
about this very thing in recent weeks, and this afternoon I read the first part of that

393
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,460
hymn story about rescue the perishing, about the priority that it was at some point in

394
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,739
days gone by amongst believers to reach the lost with the gospel.

395
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:50,659
And I said to Holly as I was sitting at my desk, and she was sitting at the conference

396
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:55,820
room table, I said, when and why did it stop becoming a priority?

397
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,299
Is that not what I said to you this afternoon?

398
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,659
It seems as if we've gotten so busy with so many other things.

399
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:03,819
and there's so many other things

400
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,079
going on in our world,

401
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,779
and there's so many things vying for our attention

402
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:10,079
that as preachers in days gone by

403
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,739
used to make this statement over and over,

404
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:16,239
keep the main thing the main thing.

405
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,319
What they would refer to in saying that

406
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,919
is the responsibility of sharing the Gospel

407
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,179
with individuals that we come into contact with.

408
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:28,279
This world is not my home.

409
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,179
We sing that, don't we?

410
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,819
We read about the patriarchs

411
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:35,299
and those in Hebrews 11

412
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,159
that were strangers and pilgrims,

413
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:39,479
and we speak about this world not being our home,

414
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:41,599
but the reality is that there are some times

415
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,519
in which we spend more time acting as if

416
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,039
this is our forever home

417
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,399
than heaven being our forever home.

418
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,579
Who are we taking with us?

419
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,119
Who am I taking with me?

420
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,179
Who am I giving the Gospel to?

421
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:55,599
Who are you giving the Gospel to?

422
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,859
I'm not this evening,

423
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,959
the Lord has worked on me

424
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,199
longer than He's worked on you

425
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:03,699
because I've been preparing these messages.

426
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:04,959
And then I get to deliver them

427
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:08,999
and get worked on again.

428
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,839
I'm convicted, personally,

429
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,279
about the need to prioritize

430
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,799
once again reaching people with the Gospel.

431
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,919
It's easy to make excuses.

432
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,959
They don't want to hear.

433
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,919
They're not interested.

434
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,059
They're too busy.

435
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,159
Did you see what they look like?

436
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,359
They're going to bite my head off.

437
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:31,099
We just make excuses.

438
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,539
But the reality is that we need to go and tell

439
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,339
if we forbear to deliver them

440
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,439
that are drawn unto death.

441
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,779
We know the end of all man

442
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,299
and we know that there is an opportunity for us.

443
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,899
I want you to consider finally this evening

444
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,099
what Paul said in Acts 20.

445
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,179
We referenced a few of these verses

446
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,659
in Acts 20 this morning,

447
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,259
but we skipped over these purposefully

448
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:54,779
because I was going to be using them this evening.

449
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,899
But as he's speaking here

450
00:31:55,959 --> 00:32:00,039
to these church leaders in Ephesus,

451
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:04,839
I want you to notice what he says in v. 26-27.

452
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,079
In v. 26-27, Paul says this,

453
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,999
Wherefore I take you to record this day,

454
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,219
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

455
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:17,399
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all

456
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,399
the counsel of God.

457
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,079
That word shunned means to be timid or to draw back.

458
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,099
It would be used to refer to those

459
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,879
who because of timidity hesitate to avow

460
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,359
what they believe.

461
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,439
That they would be unwilling to utter truth

462
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,319
due to fear.

463
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,919
And Paul says, I have not shunned

464
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,299
to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

465
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,999
I notice in v. 26,

466
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,639
and we don't have time this evening

467
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,859
to develop the entirety of the thought,

468
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,399
but Paul, of course, because of his background

469
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,079
in studying at the feet of Gamaliel

470
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,799
and all that he was with regard

471
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,459
to his Jewish studies prior to his conversion,

472
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:56,979
when he makes that statement,

473
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:58,719
Wherefore I take you to record this day,

474
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,479
that I am pure from the blood of all men,

475
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,819
I would challenge you to go back

476
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,619
to the book of Ezekiel and read v. 3 and v. 33

477
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,859
and see the way in which the Lord said to Ezekiel,

478
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:12,399
Son of man, I have set thee to be a watchman.

479
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,999
And he says if you do your job

480
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,439
and you warn them,

481
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,879
regardless of what their response is,

482
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:21,159
you're free from their blood.

483
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,919
But, if I've made you a watchman

484
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,999
and you fail to warn them,

485
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:30,719
then you're accountable for not telling them.

486
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,879
Man, that's serious.

487
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,379
And Paul, he had a deep knowledge

488
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,679
of the Old Testament.

489
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,499
And for him to say under the inspiration

490
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:42,439
of the Holy Spirit of God in v. 26,

491
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:46,139
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

492
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:48,459
I can't help but see the connection

493
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,139
from this statement to that truth

494
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,059
in the book of Ezekiel.

495
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:54,279
And I wonder this evening,

496
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,879
as we think about this reality of eternity,

497
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,919
but then the responsibility to evangelize,

498
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,999
I wonder, to some,

499
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:06,559
we need to have compassion making a difference.

500
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,359
Others, with fear, pulling them out of the fire.

501
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,679
Hating even the garments that are spotted

502
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,919
by the world.

503
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,079
And I wonder tonight,

504
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,359
who is it that maybe we're working with?

505
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,619
Who is it that we're praying for?

506
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,659
Who is it that we're setting up opportunities

507
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,379
to be able to share truth with?

508
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,219
There's someone that I have been seeking

509
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,419
to share the Gospel with,

510
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,679
and something came up today,

511
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,019
and I sent him a note.

512
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,459
It was just one of those opportunities.

513
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:35,379
Hey, here's something,

514
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:36,899
and try to keep something going

515
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,339
and give more truth.

516
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,379
There's an app,

517
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,139
and some of you don't have smart phones

518
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,679
and you're saying, I don't want any app.

519
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,599
I don't need any apps.

520
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,419
I understand.

521
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,579
I normally don't recommend a whole lot of things

522
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,479
in that nature,

523
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,679
but there's an app that I would encourage you

524
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,279
to jot down if you have a smart phone.

525
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:55,019
It's called Commission App.

526
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:58,819
It's an app that was developed, I guess,

527
00:34:58,819 --> 00:34:59,959
for lack of better terms.

528
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,239
It was probably developed by someone else,

529
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:06,239
but its purpose was used by Lancaster Baptist Church,

530
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,519
West Coast Baptist College out in California.

531
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,079
And in that particular app,

532
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,599
there are opportunities for you to go in there,

533
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,619
and I have the app downloaded on my phone,

534
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,639
and if you go into that particular app,

535
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:23,639
it opens up and it gives you how to explain salvation,

536
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,239
how to illustrate salvation,

537
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,419
and how to explain baptism.

538
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,199
You say, well, I've already prepared,

539
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,719
as we mentioned this morning with the Apostle Paul,

540
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,759
and you're ready and you may not need those helps,

541
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,959
but what I really like about this particular app

542
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:40,279
is there's a place where you can put in your prospects,

543
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,479
the people that you're working with,

544
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:45,399
the people that God has allowed you to come in contact with

545
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:47,099
and share the gospel with,

546
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,739
and you can enter someone within that prospect,

547
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,699
and you can put different notes in there

548
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:53,819
and how you're praying for them

549
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,939
and what your last contact was with them,

550
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:56,979
and so on and so forth.

551
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:57,819
Why?

552
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,939
Because we're serious about this thing of evangelizing,

553
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,699
and we're taking a personal responsibility.

554
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:06,979
And this, I believe, is a great tool that we could use.

555
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:08,579
You say, I don't have a smartphone.

556
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,279
Get a notebook.

557
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:12,259
Get some index cards.

558
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:14,339
Get something.

559
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,239
I had the privilege of sharing the gospel with this person.

560
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,079
Now pray for him.

561
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,699
Somebody shared a story with me this morning

562
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,479
about sharing a gospel tract,

563
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,439
not even meeting the individual,

564
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,319
but how that they left the gospel tract

565
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,619
in a place in which they knew

566
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,239
that the individual would receive it,

567
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,619
and as the individual picked it up and received it,

568
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,479
they stopped and they prayed for that individual.

569
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,999
Praise the Lord.

570
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:38,199
The Holy Spirit of God uses the word of God,

571
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,479
and that's someone that's saying,

572
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:42,679
I wanna get engaged, involved, personally.

573
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:48,499
I'm so challenged in my own personal walk with the Lord

574
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:52,039
with regard to this thing of missions,

575
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,739
and this responsibility that we have

576
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:56,019
to reach people with the gospel.

577
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,779
Listen, the enemy wants us to get busy

578
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,459
with all kinds of stuff.

579
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,199
He really does.

580
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:05,179
But souls are dying.

581
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,379
Who will tell them?

582
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,299
Amen?

583
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:10,139
Who will tell them?

584
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:14,239
God gives us unique privilege.

585
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,339
I think about those four leprous men.

586
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,119
We do not well.

587
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,199
Why?

588
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,959
Because today's a day of good tidings,

589
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:26,059
and we hold our peace.

590
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,359
Let us return.

591
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,279
Go and tell.

592
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,679
Wow, what a great challenge.

593
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,119
From an Old Testament account,

594
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,439
a situation in Israel,

595
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,799
they had been besieged by the Syrians for a long time.

596
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:42,099
It was terrible what was going on,

597
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,099
but how we can make application for us

598
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,019
with regard to the gospel.

599
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:49,259
Oh, that God would help us to rescue the perishing,

600
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:50,659
to care for the dying,

601
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:52,899
to throw out the lifeline,

602
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:54,279
to go and tell.

603
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:55,119
Let's pray.

604
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,059
Father, we love you.

605
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,219
We thank you for loving us.

606
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:01,659
We thank you for the opportunity that we've had today

607
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:06,659
to just focus a little bit, a lot,

608
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:10,079
upon our responsibility as your people.

609
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:14,079
God, even as I prayed this morning,

610
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,859
we're not looking for emotional responses.

611
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,119
We're looking to be changed by the truth of thy Word.

612
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,359
Help us to not be timid.

613
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,039
Help us to not be fearful.

614
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:36,699
Help us to not forbear.

615
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,179
Help us to be able to say, as Paul said,

616
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:43,599
I have not shunned to declare unto you

617
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,099
all the counsel of God.

618
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,659
Would you help us to have,

619
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:53,819
embrace the responsibility that's been given to us

620
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:56,579
and help us to get involved, engaged personally,

621
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,659
whatever level it needs to be,

622
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:00,799
that we just start somewhere,

623
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:05,179
and that today would be a day of new beginnings

624
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,859
with regard to this subject of sharing the gospel.

625
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,659
Pray that you'd work in this time of invitation,

626
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:11,579
and we'll thank you for it.

627
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,419
In Christ's name we pray.
