00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
And all the way in the back of your Bible, just before the book of Revelation, and it's

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.079
just a short chapter, but honestly, if you're to read through these 25 verses of this short

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.319
letter, you could do it in just a matter of minutes, but the truth that is contained in

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:26.319
this book is powerful and so important that we just understand the importance of all of

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.520
God's Word.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.659
We're going to go near the end of this particular letter and look at verses 22 and 23 this evening.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:38.299
As you see there in your bulletin, the title comes from verse number 23, but look at these

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:48.020
two verses here, Jude says in verse 22, and of some have compassion making a difference,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:58.299
and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.299
by the flesh.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.139
I've titled the message, Pulling Them Out of the Fire.

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:09.699
There are many hymns that we sing, of course, that remind us of the importance of preaching

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:14.019
the gospel, and what a blessing to think about those hymns.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:18.019
We mentioned a couple of them this morning as we looked at that portion of scripture,

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:22.099
the power of the gospel, and I mentioned to you this morning that I would be reading a

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:28.300
couple of passages that are written from some individuals, some hymn stories, if you will,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.940
and this first one is with the familiar hymn.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.620
It's in our songbooks, number 671, Rescue the Perishing, and what a great song that

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.940
is, rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, aren't you thankful for

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.220
the mercy of our Lord, and we find that this particular hymn story comes from barryhymns.com,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.779
and he says this, in days when reaching the lost seemed to be more of a priority for most

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:03.699
believers, many hymn writers and evangelists would use the sea to illustrate the sin in

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.620
which the lost were drowning.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.899
I read that first statement to you this morning, and I wonder when it is and why it is that

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:19.979
we have not placed as much of a priority on reaching the lost with the gospel, and you

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:26.179
see that he makes that statement that in days when, days gone by when reaching the lost

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.820
seemed to be more of a priority for most believers.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.139
He says this, they would then refer to things such as lighthouses and lifelines as the gospel

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.800
which was needed to rescue drowning mankind.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.580
Such was the case with the prolific blind hymn writer, Fanny Crosby.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.660
We know much about Fanny Crosby, and she penned the words to this particular song, Rescue

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.899
the Perishing.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.020
Of course, there are times in which we sing some of the hymns and we don't know the story

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.580
behind the hymn, and this particular account is given from an individual that had firsthand

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.380
knowledge that he received directly from Fanny Crosby with regard to the words of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.940
this great hymn.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.699
It was written in the year 1869 when I was 49 years old.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:16.220
Many of my hymns were written after experiences in New York Mission work.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.860
This one was thus written, I was addressing a large company of working men one hot summer

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.860
evening when the thought kept forcing itself on my mind that some mother's boy must be

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.460
rescued that night or not at all.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.300
So I made a pressing plea that if there was a boy present who had wandered from his mother's

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.619
home and teaching, he would come to me at the close of the service.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:46.660
A young man of 18 years came forward and said, did you mean me?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.660
I promised my mother to meet her in heaven, but as I'm now living, that will be impossible.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.100
We prayed for him and he finally arose with a new light in his eyes and exclaimed in triumph,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.020
now I can meet my mother in heaven for I have found God.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.580
A few days before, Mr. Doan, the musical composer, had sent me the subject, Rescue the Perishing.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.779
While I sat there that evening, that line came to me, rescue the perishing, care for

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.779
the dying.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.540
I could think of nothing else that night.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.579
When I arrived home, I went to work on the hymn at once.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.220
Before I retired, it was ready for the melody.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.459
The next day, my song was written out and forwarded to Mr. Doan, who wrote the beautiful

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.019
and touching music as it now stands to my hymn.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:38.380
In November of 1903, I went to Lynn, Massachusetts to speak before the Young Men's Christian

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.380
Association.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.500
I told them the incident that led to me writing Rescue the Perishing as I have just related

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500
it.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.540
After the meeting, a large number of men shook hands with me, and among them was a man who

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.940
seemed to be deeply moved.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.980
You may imagine my surprise when he said, Ms. Crosby, I was the boy who told you more

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.859
than 35 years ago that I had wandered from my mother's God.

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:07.459
The evening that you spoke at the mission, I saw and found peace, and I have tried to

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:11.679
live a consistent Christian life ever since.

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:18.660
If we never meet again on earth, we will meet up yonder, he said to her.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.019
He raised my hand to his lips, and before I had recovered from my surprise, he had gone

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:29.579
and remains to this day a nameless friend who touched a deep chord of sympathy in my

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.940
heart.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.019
Times have changed, but mankind is still drowning in the sea of sin.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.100
The gospel has not changed, and it can still rescue and save mankind.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.079
Those who are drowning are headed for spiritual death.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:48.260
It must still be our desire and goal to share the gospel, which alone can rescue them.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.739
May we do our part to rescue the perishing with a renewed spirit and fervor.

00:05:55.739 --> 00:06:00.899
Another song that might not be as familiar, we do not sing it as often.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.299
It's number 669 in our hymnal, Throw Out the Lifeline.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.540
Throw out the lifeline.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.619
And this particular song, which points out that the gospel message should motivate us

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.700
to help others by seeking and saving the lost, throw out the lifeline.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.779
This individual, Ufford, who wrote this particular hymn, he would visit Nantucket Beach, a particularly

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.019
dangerous coastal area where many ships had been destroyed on the rocks.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:35.019
He was a Baptist preacher, and it is said that the local life-saving station at Point

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:40.619
Allerton had a Lyle gun, and that Lyle gun would be used to shoot out a lifeline to ships

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:41.619
that were in need.

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:46.339
It was in 1886, while they were watching a life-saving drill and could see some of

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:51.339
the previous wrecks, a friend of his recounted a scene, which was also reported in the Boston

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.579
Globe, where a schooner was being tossed in a storm, which threatened to smash it.

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:03.019
The lifeline was shot out several times, but fell short until finally it reached the vessel

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.459
and enabled the men to haul the ship in.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:10.459
The title, Throw Out the Lifeline, stuck in Ufford's mind, so he went home, took out

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:15.399
a pencil, and had the words in ten minutes.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:19.299
The song emphasized, of course, the importance of sharing the gospel, and I'm not going to

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:23.579
take the time to read both of these particular hymns, but you can read them, you can look

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.220
them up and find them quite easily.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.299
But I think about this, and this particular hymn story comes from hymnstudiesblog.com,

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:39.260
and the author of this particular background of this hymn, Throw Out the Lifeline, concludes

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.619
by saying this, if we were to see a person drowning in the sea, we would try to do something

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:46.619
about it.

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:51.739
I mean, it's pretty easy for us to relate to that and understand what this particular

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:53.079
writer is saying.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:58.579
He then uses the analogy that if we were to see a person trapped in a burning building,

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.980
we would try to do something about it.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.980
What is it?

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.019
It's our compassion for fellow human beings that would motivate us to help them in some

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.519
way or another.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:13.720
How much more important is a person's spiritual condition than his physical life?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.320
Therefore, when we see a person lost in sin, our compassion for his soul should motivate

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.239
us to throw out the lifeline.

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:30.320
You think about these two hymns, and of course we could mention a number of others this evening,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:37.359
but there are many hymns that we sing about send the light, about I love to tell the story,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.440
I mentioned that at the conclusion of the message this morning, and many others that

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.599
we could note.

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:45.799
But as we think about the responsibility that we have in really entering into our missions

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:50.640
conference, and it starts on Saturday, and being in prayer for those that would be with

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.479
us, I want us to focus, as we will be challenged no doubt during our missions conference, on

00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:01.640
how it is that we can have some part in reaching the world with the gospel.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.320
I'm so thankful for the privilege that is ours to give to missions.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.719
I'm thankful that God has called laborers and sent forth laborers to go into the mission

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:17.080
field and to go and take the gospel, and what a unique privilege is ours to be engaged in

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.200
and involved in helping them, assisting them complete that task that God has assigned them

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.400
to.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.760
But the reality, as I've said often throughout the years, is that there is no light on our

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.200
map, there is no picture on our map of Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton, Virginia.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.859
Because we are the light.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:43.400
We are the ones that are responsible for reaching this region with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:50.840
We find that God Almighty has divinely placed us here for such a time as this.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.320
I believe that.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.239
And it's a unique opportunity that we have, as we think about these verses of Scripture

00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.599
in the book of Jude, we find that He says,

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:04.639
have compassion, making a difference. We're mindful of the compassion of our

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:09.019
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and even as he walked upon this earth during his

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:12.199
earthly ministry, many times the scriptures would tell us that he was

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:17.639
moved with compassion upon them or on them, and we find that that would result

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:22.539
in some action being taken. We looked on Wednesday evening, this past Wednesday

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:27.879
night, before we got to Acts 13, we examined Matthew 9 when the Bible says

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:32.519
that Jesus, when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, and

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:36.179
then of course he said that we're to pray to the Lord of the harvest that he

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:40.859
would send forth laborers into his harvest. Why? Because he said that the

00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:46.959
harvest is plenteous, but the laborers, they are few, and no doubt we, as we would

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.739
exercise a measure of compassion upon individuals, that we can make a

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:59.319
difference in people's lives. Someone said, and I believe there's great truth

00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:03.799
to the statement, that people don't care how much you know until they know how

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:10.239
much you care. I believe that that truth is best illustrated through the life and

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:15.239
ministry of the Apostle Paul to the believers in Thessalonica. We find that

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:18.559
as he would come to that city in Thessalonica, and then he would later

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:22.779
write to them in the book of 1 Thessalonians, he makes specific

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:28.039
statement with regard to his care for them, and he likens it to the care of a

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:32.579
mother. He says, where we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:38.119
her children. And I find that this evening it is important that we would be

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:46.539
compassionate, that we'd understand that man is blinded by the enemy, and that we

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:53.479
too were once in that same condition. Amen? Of some have compassion making a

00:11:53.479 --> 00:12:02.799
difference. And we notice in verse number 23, and others save with fear pulling

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:09.639
them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. As I think

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:13.719
about verse number 23, and I think about that phrase pulling them out of the fire,

00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:17.859
and I am mindful of that last hymn story that I read to you of throw out

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:22.899
the lifeline, and just the the illustration of what was done, and how

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:28.239
that particular man observed the drill taking place, and that Lyle gun that

00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:35.019
would shoot that lifeline out to those people that were stranded. When we were

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:39.259
not long ago, we're there in the Outer Banks, we had the opportunity to see some

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:44.159
of those life-saving stations, not only those, but of course the lighthouses, and

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:50.599
I chatted with an individual that had a just a vast amount of knowledge about

00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:56.599
life there, and he was a little older and had lived there for a long time, and began

00:12:56.599 --> 00:13:02.959
sharing some things with me about these life-saving stations. And basically, as

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:08.959
they would sit upon the shore, and they would see a ship that was just being

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:14.019
tossed to and fro, and definitely coming to a place of shipwreck, that the only

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:19.499
hope, he said, those people are going to die. And the only hope was to send out

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:24.659
that lifeline from that Lyle gun, and that it would reach far enough so that

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:30.299
some could be rescued. He said that they would practice, and they would go through

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:34.979
this process, and they would seek to be as proficient as possible in getting

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:40.599
that lifeline out. And the reality is that in some cases, it was not a safe

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:45.159
thing for them to try to travel to the particular area of the wreckage, and if

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:49.319
the particular sailors would stay with the wreckage, it was definite

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:52.919
that they would die. And if that line would get there, they would tie it off,

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:58.079
and they'd have to hand over hand make themselves safe, or bring themselves to

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.839
safety, back to shore. And begin to think about this verse of Scripture pulling

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:09.019
them out of fire, and just thinking about the reality of having the

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:12.419
gospel, and being able to share the gospel with those that we come into

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:16.079
contact with. And really just two simple thoughts this evening. Number one, the

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:20.259
reality of eternity. I mentioned this briefly this morning, but when we

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:25.019
understood the perspective of the Apostle Paul, and how that was born out

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:30.339
of his understanding as to what was at stake, and that is the reality of

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:35.839
eternity. Man is going to die, the Bible says, as it appointed unto man, once to

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:40.359
die, and after this the judgment. And we find that each individual that we come

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:48.039
into contact with, one day they are going to stand before God Almighty. It's just a

00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:53.139
certainty of the Bible. It's the reality of eternity. And as we would think about

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:57.759
the reality of eternity, and we think about those judgments that God gives to

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:02.499
us in His Word, we find that there's the bema seat of Christ, the judgment seat

00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:06.499
of Christ. And that's the judgment that if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:11.679
you'll stand there at that judgment. We'll give an account, and I'm thankful

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:15.139
that the other judgment that is mentioned is the great white throne

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:21.219
judgment. But I, because of being saved, and you, if you've trusted Christ as your

00:15:21.219 --> 00:15:26.199
Savior, we do not have to stand before God Almighty at the great white throne

00:15:26.199 --> 00:15:31.419
judgment. And for that I'm thankful. I'm thankful that the wrath of God Almighty

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:36.379
was poured upon the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, and that He paid

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:42.279
for my sin. And I don't have to stand at that great white throne judgment, but the

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:48.699
reality is that every person that we meet is going to stand before God. They're

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:53.199
going to stand before God, at either the judgment seat of Christ, or the great

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:57.819
white throne. I would say this, that most of the individuals that we come into

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:02.979
contact with are going to stand before God at the great white throne. They're going to

00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:07.419
stand before God at the great white throne. The books are going to be opened.

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:12.819
The Bible says that death and hell were cast in the lake of fire. This is the

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:19.179
second death. Prior to that, in Revelation 20, and that's verse 15, and prior to that,

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:22.979
the Bible speaks about those that are redeemed, in which the second death has

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:30.619
no power over us. I'm so thankful for that. But this evening, this thing of

00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:35.219
eternity is real. As we think about the reality of eternity, I think about the

00:16:35.219 --> 00:16:40.259
responsibility to evangelize, and how we must get involved, if you're taking notes

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:42.619
number two, the responsibility to evangelize, we must get involved

00:16:42.619 --> 00:16:48.259
personally in reaching souls with the gospel. As we would begin to think about

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:51.859
the responsibility that we have as individuals, and we begin to think about

00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:56.499
even as we preached last Sunday night about being the light, and let your light

00:16:56.499 --> 00:17:00.899
shine, and you're the light of the world, and what a blessing to understand the

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:04.099
responsibility that we have. But we'd understand even as we study throughout

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.459
the Word of God, and look at the the missionary journeys, and look at the

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.659
particular churches that were established, you will find that from

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:17.059
those local churches, those individuals went out and shared the gospel. I

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:22.219
mentioned earlier about the church in Thessalonica, and what Paul commented

00:17:22.219 --> 00:17:25.899
with regard to his practice there, and the way in which he cared for those

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:29.099
individuals, but you'll be mindful in the first chapter of the book of 1st

00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:34.819
Thessalonians, that the Word of God tells us that Paul really is commending them,

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:37.379
in 1st Thessalonians 1 and verse 8, and he says,

00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:42.139
"...from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but

00:17:42.139 --> 00:17:46.339
also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:51.219
not to speak to anything." And so what is he saying? He's saying from this church

00:17:51.219 --> 00:17:57.899
in Thessalonica, they understood their responsibility to evangelize. We studied

00:17:57.899 --> 00:18:02.259
this morning in Romans chapter number 1, and what great truth Paul gives us with

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:06.499
regard to his own personal understanding, but you understand that the Bible says

00:18:06.499 --> 00:18:10.859
in verse number 8 of Romans 1, "...first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:17.979
all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world." We find that

00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:24.179
there are individuals that understand this responsibility, and we must

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:28.299
get involved personally. It's a blessing to me when I have the opportunity, and I

00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:33.459
know we live in a very populated area, and so it's not very often that we

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:38.139
bump into the same person in the same week. It's just so many people in our

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:44.380
area, and I've spoken to some pastors that pastor in much smaller areas, and in

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.659
fact, I spoke to a man on Tuesday at a pastor's meeting, and I asked him how

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:51.259
many were in the place where he was ministering. I never even heard of the

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:54.819
place here in Virginia where he's a pastor, and I said, I'm sorry, I've

00:18:54.819 --> 00:18:57.899
never heard of it. Where is it? You know, how many people are there? He said, well,

00:18:57.899 --> 00:19:04.859
in our entire county, there's about 5,000 people. I said, I think there

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:08.979
were that many at Walmart yesterday. That's how I felt anyway, man. But the

00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:13.619
reality is that there are some places like that where the likelihood of coming

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:17.219
into contact with the same person the same week is higher than it would be

00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:22.619
here. But there have been times over these last almost 10 years that I have taken

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.539
out a gospel tract, and I've sought to give it to an individual, and they've

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:31.339
said, I just got one of those from someone. And I find that someone from

00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:37.299
within our church gave them a gospel tract and invited them to read the

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:43.339
truth of the gospel, and it encourages me. It's a blessing to me when we have

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:46.539
the privilege of seeing that. I had someone call me from Office Depot a few

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:51.579
years ago, and they said, hey, I just want to let you know that someone was in here

00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:55.779
and they gave me a gospel tract, and I just appreciate that there's a church

00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:01.619
that has a pastor that cares enough about reaching...

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:05.299
people that not only does he encourage people to do it, but he supplies gospel tracts.

00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:07.379
That's what the person said to me on the phone.

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:10.579
Now I thought they were going to complain about the fact that somebody had left a gospel

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:14.819
tract at Office Depot, so I was getting all prepared for the conversation of, you know,

00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:17.979
you're not allowed to be bringing this stuff in and all this sort of thing, but then they

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:23.099
thanked me, and it was refreshing, it was encouraging, and I was rejoicing at the end

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:25.459
of that conversation.

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:31.179
But what it is is that each individual has to understand that we have a responsibility

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:36.079
personally to reach individuals with the gospel.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:40.739
And I want you to think about really three portions of Scripture this evening, and we're

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:47.859
going to go back to 2 Kings chapter number 7 with this thought of our responsibility,

00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:48.859
pulling them out of the fire.

00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:52.299
I want you to go back to 2 Kings 7, we're going to look at a passage there, we're going

00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:56.579
to go to the book of Proverbs and then conclude in Acts chapter number 20, but I want you

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:03.059
to look at 2 Kings chapter number 7, and just even as I stated that passage of Scripture,

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:09.399
perhaps someone was already mindful of what takes place here in this particular passage.

00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:15.979
You find that it's here that Elisha makes that declaration with regard to all that was

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:22.099
taking place with their lack of food and supply being taken care of, and that servant responds

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:26.519
about even if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be, and so on

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.519
and so forth.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:34.339
But we find that God is going to work and God is going to provide, but within the story

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:39.579
there's another story, and it's the story of these leprous men.

00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:44.819
And in 2 Kings 7, the Bible says in verse 3, and there were four leprous men at the

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:49.139
entering into the gate, and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?

00:21:49.139 --> 00:21:54.779
So they go through this process of if we stay here we're going to die, if we stay

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:58.419
here we're going to die, we don't have any food, and we're leprous, and if we go

00:21:58.419 --> 00:22:02.979
to the Syrians there's a possibility that we would have the opportunity to have grace

00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:06.539
in their eyes and we might live, and so on and so forth, and so they make the decision

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:12.220
to go, and without them knowing, the Lord, according to verse number 6, had made the

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.940
host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, even the noise of a

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.339
great host, and they said one to another, lo, the king of Israel hath hired against

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:26.379
us the king of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us, wherefore

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:31.419
they, that's the Syrians, they arose and fled in the twilight, they left their tents,

00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:35.539
their horses, their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:39.220
The same time that that's happening, these four leprous men are saying, hey, let's,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.979
you know, what's the point of staying here, let's go.

00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:48.500
Verse 8, and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.379
one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and raiment and went

00:22:52.379 --> 00:22:56.779
and hid it, and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:58.339
and hid it.

00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:01.059
They find great spoil.

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:03.459
I mean, can you imagine?

00:23:03.459 --> 00:23:10.379
These four leprous men, they go to the place, the camp of the Syrians and they find that

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:14.500
there's no one there, but all of the supplies are there.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.139
I mean, everything, they left it all.

00:23:16.139 --> 00:23:21.259
And they said, man, this is great, but I want you to notice what they say in verse number

00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:31.099
9, then they said one to another, we do not well.

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:35.419
Why was it that they reached this conclusion?

00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:37.299
We do not well, why?

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:46.099
This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:50.539
If we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us.

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:57.019
Now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.019
They said we do not well.

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:00.819
See, they came upon a great amount of spoil.

00:24:00.819 --> 00:24:05.619
There were people that were dying of hunger.

00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:09.220
And they had found great substance.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.779
And they went into one tent, the Bible tells us in verse number 8, and they ate, they drank,

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:17.899
they carried then silver and gold raiment, went and hid it, and then they came into another

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:18.899
tent.

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:22.220
There's only so much that these four men could eat and drink of themselves, there's only

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.779
so much that they could hide.

00:24:23.779 --> 00:24:29.739
And they go into that next tent and together they say, we do not well.

00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:31.779
We do not well, why?

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:37.779
This day is a day of good tidings, and notice, we hold our peace.

00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:44.220
We need to go back, and we need to go, notice where it says that we may go and tell the

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.419
king's household.

00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:47.059
Now here's the amazing thing.

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:54.139
They couldn't make anyone of the nation of Israel go to find the spoil.

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:59.139
All they could do is go and tell them as to what they found, right?

00:24:59.139 --> 00:25:00.139
They couldn't make them go.

00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:03.739
In fact, the Bible tells us in verse number 10, so they came and called unto the porter

00:25:03.739 --> 00:25:07.179
of the city, and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,

00:25:07.179 --> 00:25:10.979
there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied and asses tied in the tents

00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:12.220
as they were.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.139
And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's house within.

00:25:16.139 --> 00:25:18.179
Notice what the king says in verse number 12.

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:22.139
He arose in the night and said unto the servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have

00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:23.380
done to us.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.500
They know that we be hungry, therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.699
in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and

00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:31.699
get into the city.

00:25:31.699 --> 00:25:32.699
What's he doing?

00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:36.459
He's objecting to going to where the food is.

00:25:36.459 --> 00:25:38.179
Oh, they've set up a trap.

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:40.739
I mean, they're going to, they've hid themselves.

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:43.940
They know that we're hungry, and we come, and they've lured us in, and then they're

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.339
going to come and conquer us.

00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:48.899
Well, you can believe what you want, but we just went into the tents, and we got food.

00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:49.899
Right?

00:25:49.899 --> 00:25:53.380
I mean, can you see these four leprous men?

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.380
And as I look at this passage of Scripture, if I could draw an application to sharing

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.220
the gospel, we have found the light.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.540
We have found the truth.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.619
And if our gospel be hid, Paul said as I mentioned this morning, it is hid to them that are lost,

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:16.220
I would say this evening, then in a much more important fashion, even as the writer said

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:22.019
of that last hymn that I read, that hymn story, if we found somebody that was drowning, if

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:26.260
we found somebody in a burning building, but how much more important when we think

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.459
about the souls of mankind, and I would say to you this evening that if we have found

00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:38.059
the truth, and we are not sharing it, we do not well.

00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:39.699
Period.

00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:40.859
End of story.

00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:43.500
We do not well.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.380
Why?

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:52.699
Because we know the truth, and we know the Savior, and we know what He offers.

00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:59.419
They, these lepers, all they could do is go and tell.

00:26:59.419 --> 00:27:04.699
They couldn't make anyone come to any tent of Assyrian.

00:27:04.699 --> 00:27:05.699
That's all they could do is go and tell.

00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:06.699
And you know what?

00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:10.859
All the Lord requires of us is to go and tell.

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:12.979
To go and tell.

00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:19.619
He gives us the truth, and then He entrusts us with that truth to go and tell others.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:24.619
I can't force anyone to be saved, and neither can you.

00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:28.019
But oh, that we would go and tell them.

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:32.820
That we would make it known that we would not hold our peace.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:38.100
If you look at the remainder of this passage, and we're going to move on, but you find that

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.339
they find it just as the four lepers said the people went out and spoiled the tents

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:47.299
according to verse number 16, so that a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:51.899
measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, just as Elisha had

00:27:51.899 --> 00:27:53.699
prophesied in verse number 1.

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:58.660
And I understand the physical aspect of this particular account, but I draw the spiritual

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.260
application for us this evening.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.220
We do not well if we hold our peace.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.660
We need to go and tell.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.979
This is what's over in the book of Proverbs, if you will, in Proverbs chapter number 24.

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:15.139
I believe in these couple of verses of Scripture in Proverbs 24, that there's an obvious application

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:20.260
for us in these verses with regard to sharing the gospel.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:26.059
The Bible says in Proverbs 24, verse number 11,

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:32.100
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.859
slain, if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not, doth not he that pondereth the heart

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:40.460
consider it?

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:45.219
And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:50.659
And shall not he render to every man according to his works?

00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:54.460
I believe that there's a spiritual application here as well, just as there was in 2 Kings

00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:00.059
7, that we'd understand this word forbear is used in verse number 11, if thou forbear

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:05.940
to deliver them that are drawn unto death, it means to procrastinate or to refrain.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:12.059
And we understand that this evening, that it's easier for us to make excuses than for

00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:14.539
us to just do what we're supposed to do.

00:29:14.539 --> 00:29:20.820
Because notice what he says in verse number 12, if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.380
It's easy for us to make excuses, it really is.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.779
It's easy for me to make excuses.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.380
I sat in my office this afternoon, in fact, Holly and I have had a couple of conversations

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.700
about this very thing in recent weeks, and this afternoon I read the first part of that

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.460
hymn story about rescue the perishing, about the priority that it was at some point in

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.739
days gone by amongst believers to reach the lost with the gospel.

00:29:46.739 --> 00:29:50.659
And I said to Holly as I was sitting at my desk, and she was sitting at the conference

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:55.820
room table, I said, when and why did it stop becoming a priority?

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.299
Is that not what I said to you this afternoon?

00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:01.659
It seems as if we've gotten so busy with so many other things.

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:03.819
and there's so many other things

00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:05.079
going on in our world,

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:07.779
and there's so many things vying for our attention

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:10.079
that as preachers in days gone by

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:12.739
used to make this statement over and over,

00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:16.239
keep the main thing the main thing.

00:30:16.239 --> 00:30:18.319
What they would refer to in saying that

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:20.919
is the responsibility of sharing the Gospel

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:25.179
with individuals that we come into contact with.

00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:28.279
This world is not my home.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.179
We sing that, don't we?

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:32.819
We read about the patriarchs

00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:35.299
and those in Hebrews 11

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:37.159
that were strangers and pilgrims,

00:30:37.159 --> 00:30:39.479
and we speak about this world not being our home,

00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:41.599
but the reality is that there are some times

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.519
in which we spend more time acting as if

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:45.039
this is our forever home

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:48.399
than heaven being our forever home.

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.579
Who are we taking with us?

00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:51.119
Who am I taking with me?

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:53.179
Who am I giving the Gospel to?

00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:55.599
Who are you giving the Gospel to?

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:57.859
I'm not this evening,

00:30:57.859 --> 00:30:59.959
the Lord has worked on me

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:01.199
longer than He's worked on you

00:31:01.199 --> 00:31:03.699
because I've been preparing these messages.

00:31:03.699 --> 00:31:04.959
And then I get to deliver them

00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:08.999
and get worked on again.

00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:12.839
I'm convicted, personally,

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:15.279
about the need to prioritize

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.799
once again reaching people with the Gospel.

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:19.919
It's easy to make excuses.

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:20.959
They don't want to hear.

00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:21.919
They're not interested.

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.059
They're too busy.

00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:26.159
Did you see what they look like?

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.359
They're going to bite my head off.

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:31.099
We just make excuses.

00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:34.539
But the reality is that we need to go and tell

00:31:34.539 --> 00:31:36.339
if we forbear to deliver them

00:31:36.339 --> 00:31:37.439
that are drawn unto death.

00:31:37.439 --> 00:31:39.779
We know the end of all man

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.299
and we know that there is an opportunity for us.

00:31:42.299 --> 00:31:44.899
I want you to consider finally this evening

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:46.099
what Paul said in Acts 20.

00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:48.179
We referenced a few of these verses

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:49.659
in Acts 20 this morning,

00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:52.259
but we skipped over these purposefully

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:54.779
because I was going to be using them this evening.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:55.899
But as he's speaking here

00:31:55.959 --> 00:32:00.039
to these church leaders in Ephesus,

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:04.839
I want you to notice what he says in v. 26-27.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:07.079
In v. 26-27, Paul says this,

00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:09.999
Wherefore I take you to record this day,

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:13.219
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:17.399
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all

00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:19.399
the counsel of God.

00:32:19.399 --> 00:32:22.079
That word shunned means to be timid or to draw back.

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:24.099
It would be used to refer to those

00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:26.879
who because of timidity hesitate to avow

00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:28.359
what they believe.

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:30.439
That they would be unwilling to utter truth

00:32:30.439 --> 00:32:32.319
due to fear.

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:34.919
And Paul says, I have not shunned

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:40.299
to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:41.999
I notice in v. 26,

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:43.639
and we don't have time this evening

00:32:43.639 --> 00:32:45.859
to develop the entirety of the thought,

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:48.399
but Paul, of course, because of his background

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.079
in studying at the feet of Gamaliel

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:52.799
and all that he was with regard

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:55.459
to his Jewish studies prior to his conversion,

00:32:55.459 --> 00:32:56.979
when he makes that statement,

00:32:56.979 --> 00:32:58.719
Wherefore I take you to record this day,

00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:00.479
that I am pure from the blood of all men,

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:01.819
I would challenge you to go back

00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:04.619
to the book of Ezekiel and read v. 3 and v. 33

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.859
and see the way in which the Lord said to Ezekiel,

00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:12.399
Son of man, I have set thee to be a watchman.

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:13.999
And he says if you do your job

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.439
and you warn them,

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:17.879
regardless of what their response is,

00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:21.159
you're free from their blood.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:23.919
But, if I've made you a watchman

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:26.999
and you fail to warn them,

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:30.719
then you're accountable for not telling them.

00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:33.879
Man, that's serious.

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:36.379
And Paul, he had a deep knowledge

00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:38.679
of the Old Testament.

00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:40.499
And for him to say under the inspiration

00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:42.439
of the Holy Spirit of God in v. 26,

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:46.139
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.459
I can't help but see the connection

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.139
from this statement to that truth

00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:52.059
in the book of Ezekiel.

00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:54.279
And I wonder this evening,

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:58.879
as we think about this reality of eternity,

00:33:58.879 --> 00:34:01.919
but then the responsibility to evangelize,

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:03.999
I wonder, to some,

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:06.559
we need to have compassion making a difference.

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:09.359
Others, with fear, pulling them out of the fire.

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.679
Hating even the garments that are spotted

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:12.919
by the world.

00:34:12.919 --> 00:34:15.079
And I wonder tonight,

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:18.359
who is it that maybe we're working with?

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:20.619
Who is it that we're praying for?

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:22.659
Who is it that we're setting up opportunities

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.379
to be able to share truth with?

00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:27.219
There's someone that I have been seeking

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.419
to share the Gospel with,

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:30.679
and something came up today,

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.019
and I sent him a note.

00:34:32.019 --> 00:34:34.459
It was just one of those opportunities.

00:34:34.459 --> 00:34:35.379
Hey, here's something,

00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:36.899
and try to keep something going

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:39.339
and give more truth.

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:40.379
There's an app,

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:42.139
and some of you don't have smart phones

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.679
and you're saying, I don't want any app.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.599
I don't need any apps.

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:45.419
I understand.

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:47.579
I normally don't recommend a whole lot of things

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.479
in that nature,

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:50.679
but there's an app that I would encourage you

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.279
to jot down if you have a smart phone.

00:34:52.279 --> 00:34:55.019
It's called Commission App.

00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:58.819
It's an app that was developed, I guess,

00:34:58.819 --> 00:34:59.959
for lack of better terms.

00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:01.239
It was probably developed by someone else,

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:06.239
but its purpose was used by Lancaster Baptist Church,

00:35:06.839 --> 00:35:09.519
West Coast Baptist College out in California.

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:11.079
And in that particular app,

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:13.599
there are opportunities for you to go in there,

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:16.619
and I have the app downloaded on my phone,

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:19.639
and if you go into that particular app,

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:23.639
it opens up and it gives you how to explain salvation,

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:25.239
how to illustrate salvation,

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:27.419
and how to explain baptism.

00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:29.199
You say, well, I've already prepared,

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:31.719
as we mentioned this morning with the Apostle Paul,

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:34.759
and you're ready and you may not need those helps,

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:36.959
but what I really like about this particular app

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:40.279
is there's a place where you can put in your prospects,

00:35:40.279 --> 00:35:41.479
the people that you're working with,

00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:45.399
the people that God has allowed you to come in contact with

00:35:45.419 --> 00:35:47.099
and share the gospel with,

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:50.739
and you can enter someone within that prospect,

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:52.699
and you can put different notes in there

00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:53.819
and how you're praying for them

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:55.939
and what your last contact was with them,

00:35:55.939 --> 00:35:56.979
and so on and so forth.

00:35:56.979 --> 00:35:57.819
Why?

00:35:57.819 --> 00:36:00.939
Because we're serious about this thing of evangelizing,

00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:03.699
and we're taking a personal responsibility.

00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:06.979
And this, I believe, is a great tool that we could use.

00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:08.579
You say, I don't have a smartphone.

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:10.279
Get a notebook.

00:36:10.279 --> 00:36:12.259
Get some index cards.

00:36:12.259 --> 00:36:14.339
Get something.

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.239
I had the privilege of sharing the gospel with this person.

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:18.079
Now pray for him.

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.699
Somebody shared a story with me this morning

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:21.479
about sharing a gospel tract,

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.439
not even meeting the individual,

00:36:23.439 --> 00:36:25.319
but how that they left the gospel tract

00:36:25.319 --> 00:36:26.619
in a place in which they knew

00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:28.239
that the individual would receive it,

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.619
and as the individual picked it up and received it,

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:33.479
they stopped and they prayed for that individual.

00:36:33.479 --> 00:36:34.999
Praise the Lord.

00:36:34.999 --> 00:36:38.199
The Holy Spirit of God uses the word of God,

00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:39.479
and that's someone that's saying,

00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:42.679
I wanna get engaged, involved, personally.

00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:48.499
I'm so challenged in my own personal walk with the Lord

00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:52.039
with regard to this thing of missions,

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:53.739
and this responsibility that we have

00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:56.019
to reach people with the gospel.

00:36:56.019 --> 00:36:57.779
Listen, the enemy wants us to get busy

00:36:57.779 --> 00:36:59.459
with all kinds of stuff.

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:02.199
He really does.

00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:05.179
But souls are dying.

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:07.379
Who will tell them?

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:09.299
Amen?

00:37:09.299 --> 00:37:10.139
Who will tell them?

00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:14.239
God gives us unique privilege.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.339
I think about those four leprous men.

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:19.119
We do not well.

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.199
Why?

00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:22.959
Because today's a day of good tidings,

00:37:22.959 --> 00:37:26.059
and we hold our peace.

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:29.359
Let us return.

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:31.279
Go and tell.

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:33.679
Wow, what a great challenge.

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:35.119
From an Old Testament account,

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.439
a situation in Israel,

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:39.799
they had been besieged by the Syrians for a long time.

00:37:40.339 --> 00:37:42.099
It was terrible what was going on,

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:44.099
but how we can make application for us

00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:46.019
with regard to the gospel.

00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:49.259
Oh, that God would help us to rescue the perishing,

00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:50.659
to care for the dying,

00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:52.899
to throw out the lifeline,

00:37:52.899 --> 00:37:54.279
to go and tell.

00:37:54.279 --> 00:37:55.119
Let's pray.

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.059
Father, we love you.

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:57.219
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:57.219 --> 00:38:01.659
We thank you for the opportunity that we've had today

00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:06.659
to just focus a little bit, a lot,

00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:10.079
upon our responsibility as your people.

00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:14.079
God, even as I prayed this morning,

00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:19.859
we're not looking for emotional responses.

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:26.119
We're looking to be changed by the truth of thy Word.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:30.359
Help us to not be timid.

00:38:30.359 --> 00:38:32.039
Help us to not be fearful.

00:38:32.819 --> 00:38:36.699
Help us to not forbear.

00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:40.179
Help us to be able to say, as Paul said,

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:43.599
I have not shunned to declare unto you

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.099
all the counsel of God.

00:38:46.299 --> 00:38:47.659
Would you help us to have,

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:53.819
embrace the responsibility that's been given to us

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:56.579
and help us to get involved, engaged personally,

00:38:57.539 --> 00:38:59.659
whatever level it needs to be,

00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:00.799
that we just start somewhere,

00:39:00.819 --> 00:39:05.179
and that today would be a day of new beginnings

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:07.859
with regard to this subject of sharing the gospel.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.659
Pray that you'd work in this time of invitation,

00:39:10.659 --> 00:39:11.579
and we'll thank you for it.

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:12.419
In Christ's name we pray.
