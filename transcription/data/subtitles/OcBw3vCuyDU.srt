1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
If you will, and turn to the book of Philemon, and be looking at just a verse of Scripture

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,760
here from the book of Philemon.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,319
And I won't be dealing with the whole thought of that which is developed here in the book

4
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,319
of Philemon.

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:14,680
There's only one chapter, so turn to chapter number one, amen?

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,719
And we'll look here at just a verse of Scripture.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,760
I hope to be a blessing to you this evening as we think about this truth that is given

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
to us.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,479
The Apostle Paul had the privilege to serve in many regions during his ministry.

10
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:32,520
In fact, as you trace the steps of Paul, if you begin to look through the book of Acts

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,080
and trace the missionary journeys, the first, second, and third, you begin to see the regions

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,520
in which God enabled and allowed the Apostle Paul to serve and to minister.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,759
And along the way, he had the opportunity to meet a whole lot of people.

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,959
And he had people that he was able to meet that, of course, were the enemies, the opposition,

15
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,400
those that opposed him.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,240
And occasionally he mentions those folks, but there are a lot of people that he had

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,520
the opportunity to serve God with.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,360
And as he would serve and as he would minister in various regions, God would allow him to

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,319
have those relationships established.

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,599
In fact, as you read through the New Testament, and you have the opportunity to read many

21
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,120
of the books that God has allowed the Apostle Paul to be the human penman of, that you have

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,319
the privilege of reading of several of those names that are mentioned.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,959
In fact, you can look at the end of many of the epistles and see where the Apostle will

24
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,680
mention people by name, specifically.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,199
Sometimes he gives us some information about them.

26
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,279
Sometimes there's not a whole lot that's given to us, but names are provided.

27
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:43,720
It's interesting if you were to read Romans 16, that is an especially lengthy portion

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,360
of Scripture with a lot of names that are provided of these people that God allowed

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,760
the path of the Apostle Paul to cross with and to serve alongside of.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,760
And of course, in many cases, to minister to them, but also to minister along with them.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
The name Archippus is found both here in the book of Philemon.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
It's also found over in the book of Colossians.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,759
And we'll look at both passages of Scripture this evening.

34
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,399
Notice in verse number one of the book of Philemon, the Bible says, Paul, a prisoner

35
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:19,440
of Jesus Christ, and Timothy, our brother, unto Philemon, our dearly beloved and fellow

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
laborer.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,800
And he says this, and to our beloved Athia and Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,039
the church in thy house, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus

39
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,039
Christ.

40
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,119
Right in the beginning of the letter, we find that God gives us an understanding as to the

41
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:42,919
time of the writing of this short letter that is sent, of course, to Philemon and also to

42
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,279
Athia and Archippus, as it's mentioned in verse number two.

43
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:52,039
As we would consider the timing of the letter, he says that Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

44
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,199
We understand many of the epistles we would refer to as the prison epistles, and this

45
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:03,320
letter, along with the book of Colossians that we'll reference this evening as well,

46
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,160
they were both written, they're both referred to as these prison epistles that were written

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,440
around the same time from the same location during Paul's first confinement there in Rome.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
And so we understand a little bit of background about what God is giving us with regard to

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,160
the timing of the writing and who he's writing to.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,520
We're not going to deal with really the thought and the full message of the book of Philemon.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,600
In fact, if you go back and read through it, you'll see a beautiful picture that is given

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,559
to us with regard to this one on Onesimus and all that took place and how in the past

53
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,880
he was unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Why?

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Because he's been saved.

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,199
And great message, but not the message for this evening.

57
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,639
The message for this evening, we're going to focus on this one, Archippus.

58
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,559
Notice the Bible tells us, and we're going to use it for our title this evening, look

59
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:56,399
at it, it says, and to our beloved Athia, and Archippus, our fellow soldier.

60
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:01,479
Archippus, our fellow soldier, is the title for the message this evening.

61
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:07,160
I want you to notice, first of all, if you're taking notes, notice how this man is identified.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,559
We've read it there in verse number two, he's identified as a fellow soldier.

63
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,240
I like that terminology.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,760
I like the picture that you get in your mind when you read that description, that identifying

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,000
name title, if you will, that is given.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,279
The Bible says, now, and Archippus, our fellow soldier.

67
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,760
It's interesting to me that the title, if I could use that terminology this evening,

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,320
of fellow soldier, that the Apostle Paul only refers to two people in all of the Scriptures

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,920
with that title.

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,640
We read about being a good soldier, and so on and so forth, and we'll reference some

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,119
of that this evening, but there are two people specifically that he mentions as being fellow

72
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,119
soldiers.

73
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,279
We notice in the first verse of Philemon, that as he speaks about Philemon, he uses

74
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,440
this terminology, our dearly beloved and fellow laborer.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm thankful that he was a co-laborer, a fellow laborer, and in that word is used, we find

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,839
that Paul says there in the church in Corinth, as he's ministering to them, of course, the

77
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,679
divisions and schisms and all that was taking place in Corinth, and I'm of Paul, and I'm

78
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:23,940
of Cephas, and I'm of Apollos, and so on and so forth, and Paul says, we're just laborers

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,320
together with God.

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,880
And in chapter number three of 1 Corinthians, what a great perspective to have.

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,640
But this title that we find here that is given as an identifier, if you will, for

82
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,959
Archippus is fellow soldier.

83
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,119
It is used also of speaking of Epaphroditus.

84
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:46,119
Turn back to the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number two of the book of

85
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,119
Philippians.

86
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:53,040
Now, Epaphroditus was a man we believe most likely the pastor of the church there in Philippi.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,160
He speaks about him as being a companion in labor, my brother, but notice in Philippians

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,000
two, in verse number 25, it says, yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,880
my brother and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered

90
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
to my wants.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,200
It's commonly believed that as the church at Philippi collected this offering to assist

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,239
the apostle Paul, that it was taken, delivered to Paul by the hand of Epaphroditus, and he

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,959
took that as the messenger of the church, he brought that offering to the apostle Paul,

94
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,799
and then Paul would deliver this letter back to the church at Philippi by the hands of

95
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,079
Epaphroditus.

96
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,480
And we find here that he's referred to as fellow soldier.

97
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,399
And again, it's Epaphroditus and this one, Archippus.

98
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:56,239
It's interesting because this title reveals to me the fact that they were engaged in battle.

99
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:03,399
You immediately get in your mind when you read that title, that term that is ascribed

100
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,760
to Archippus here, the way in which he's identified, we see this fellow soldier, he's engaged in

101
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,359
the battle.

102
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,799
The battle that he's engaged in though is a spiritual battle.

103
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:20,200
And the reality this evening is that each and every one of us are engaged in a spiritual

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,059
battle.

105
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,339
We see this spiritual battle, this spiritual warfare that Paul speaks of to the believers

106
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,179
in the book of Ephesians there as they're ministering in the city of Ephesus and that

107
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:34,059
church that is there and ministering and serving.

108
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:39,619
And Paul tells them, listen, we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

109
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,480
And the reality is that if you have any sense about you, and I don't say that to be condescending,

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:52,519
you can obviously, without hesitation, identify today that we're in the midst of spiritual

111
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,519
warfare.

112
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,640
I mean, the spiritual battle that is raging.

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,200
And we find that this man, Archippus, not to say that others weren't fellow soldiers,

114
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,000
but it's interesting that there's just a couple of people that are given, that are spoken

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
of in this term.

116
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,760
You find often that the Apostle Paul, when he speaks about Timothy, how does he refer

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
to Timothy?

118
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
My son in the faith.

119
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,239
He refers to Titus in like manner.

120
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,519
In fact, he speaks of Onesimus in that fashion as well.

121
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,600
But we find that there's a purpose.

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,640
We believe that every word of God is pure.

123
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,239
And the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

124
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:37,359
And God led the Apostle Paul to use this term, this title, in identifying this one, Archippus.

125
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:43,099
Now, the reality is that Paul had spoken to Timothy about the importance of understanding

126
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,020
our place as being a soldier and what it means to be a good soldier.

127
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,900
Notice if you will, over in 2 Timothy chapter number 2, I'm going to draw your attention

128
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,539
quickly this evening to just the first four verses of this passage of Scripture.

129
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,580
And I want you to just get the instruction that Paul is leaving for Timothy, of course,

130
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,140
by way of preservation for us as well to this day.

131
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,940
He says this in verse number 1 of 2 Timothy 2,

132
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,979
Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

133
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:17,380
The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful

134
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,539
men who shall be able to teach others also.

135
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:30,840
He says this, Thou, therefore, endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,039
He says, No man that woreth and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that

137
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,280
he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

138
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Who's that?

139
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Well, that's the Lord.

140
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Amen?

141
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,520
You trust that Christ is your personal Savior.

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,640
You are enlisted in the Lord's army.

143
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Amen?

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,159
You became a soldier of Jesus Christ.

145
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,799
We find that we sing the song with the kids about being in the Lord's army, right?

146
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,640
And we have fun with singing that.

147
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,140
We sing.

148
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,180
songs about onward Christian soldier right and we understand some of the

149
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,300
songwriters that have taken up on this thought of being a soldier and this is

150
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,740
an analogy an illustration that is used to help us understand this this

151
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,820
Christian life that we're living in this battle in which were engaged in and Paul

152
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,180
says to Timothy that that you might be a good soldier that you may please him who

153
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,060
have chosen him to be a soldier wonder this evening as we would think about

154
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,180
this title that is given to Archippus in our text of Scripture the way in which

155
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,820
he is identified I wonder this evening if someone would say of me if someone

156
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,420
would say of you there are fellow soldier a fellow soldier I wonder this

157
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,340
evening if we understand really the the spiritual warfare in battle that we are

158
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,620
engaged in the truth of Ephesians 6 is a powerful truth that we must be

159
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,260
mindful of on a regular basis we spoke of course of the theme for 2019 be

160
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,980
strong the Lord I preached to the whole book of Ephesians we belabored the point

161
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,100
but it's good to be reminded of the fact that we're engaged in spiritual warfare

162
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,660
and we wrestle not against flesh and blood we're to put on the whole armor of

163
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,460
God by the way that's not a one-and-done situation that is an everyday

164
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,820
sometimes you might have to go put the armor on again because something

165
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,860
happened as you were engaged in battle and you you have to understand the

166
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:44,660
importance of this battle that we're in and Paul says as he refers to this one

167
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,500
this co-laborer but more than that a fellow soldier we notice how he's

168
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,700
identified I want you to notice over the book of Colossians how he is instructed

169
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,220
the book of Colossians gives us some some information at the end of the book

170
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,140
again I mentioned how that many times I said this by way of introduction that

171
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,100
you get to the end of some of these epistles that God allowed Paul to be the

172
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,700
human penman of and you see a reference to a number of individuals people that

173
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,180
he served and ministered to people that he served alongside of and we find that

174
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,380
beginning in Colossians 4 and verse number 7 is where you begin to see a

175
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,740
number of those names that will be mentioned throughout the end of this

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,060
particular passage of Scripture names that Paul mentions we get down to verse

177
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:39,380
number 17 and it says this notice and say to Archippus so so this is this

178
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,540
interesting to me because really he says just catch it in context notice in verse

179
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,460
number 7 all my states shall take a kiss declare unto you who is a beloved

180
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,140
brother and faithful minister and fellow servant the Lord verse 9 with Onesimus a

181
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,500
faithful and beloved brother who's one of you they shall make known unto all

182
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,140
things which are done here we see that he mentions about others he goes through

183
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,060
and he speaks of them favorably and about their labor and their service but

184
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,220
when he comes to verse number 17 and he's going to speak about Archippus he

185
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,780
says and say to Archippus there's some instruction that I want to make sure it

186
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:21,820
gets delivered to this one this fellow soldier that's engaged in the battle

187
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,020
there's some instruction that I want to make sure it gets to him see with the

188
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,060
other folks that are mentioned there's not necessarily a piece of information

189
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,060
that is to be given to them as much as there's a description as to how they're

190
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,180
engaged in the work and what they're doing and their faithfulness and we

191
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,000
notice that Paul says this notice what he says we're gonna break the statement

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,620
down number one he says take heed to the ministry now we're going to pause

193
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,540
right there I know that's not the fullness of the thought but we're just

194
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,300
gonna pause there for just a moment and this idea of taking heed to to discern

195
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,380
to understand to have a knowledge of and he says take heed but notice what he

196
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,140
says he could have stopped again every word of God is pure take heed to the

197
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,900
ministry notice how it's described which thou hast received in the Lord now let

198
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,500
me ask you do those words that are given after ministry don't you think

199
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,980
those are important words he didn't just stop take heed to the ministry he says

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:37,460
take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord I think about

201
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,220
the message that would be delivered I believe that the recipients here would

202
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,580
have faithfully taken and delivered this message and say to archivist okay here's

203
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,220
the message for you it's been contained and preserved for us so that we can read

204
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,700
it and be encouraged by it and be challenged by it but we find that as he

205
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,460
would receive those words when when it says take heed to the ministry and then

206
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:07,260
which thou hast received in the Lord it's the Lord that calls us to the

207
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,460
ministry it's the Lord that equips us for the work of the ministry it's the

208
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,220
Lord who enables us we find that as we would understand the truth of spiritual

209
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,140
gifts within the the Church of God and we'd understand how the Holy Spirit of

210
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,780
God gifts each individual believer as he will amen and he's the one that gives

211
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,500
you and equips you for the work of the ministry for the the work that God has

212
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,260
called us to now this one archivist he may have had a particular position

213
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,300
there's some that have the idea that he may have been a pastor of a church and

214
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,100
whatever the particular ministry may have been that he was engaged in we find

215
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,820
that the Apostle Paul in delivering this message of taking heed to the ministry

216
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,620
which now has received in the Lord is reminding him that he had been called by

217
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,180
God they've been given this ministry by the Lord I think about the words of Paul

218
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,340
when he says this and and you can just let me read the verse to you but in

219
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,580
first Timothy 1 in verse number 12 Paul says and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord

220
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:22,660
who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry

221
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,500
see Paul understood that he was called by God in fact as you read through many

222
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,580
of the epistles and that that Paul was the human penman for you'll find that he

223
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,100
references the call that God has placed upon his life in those introductory

224
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,700
statements in fact here in first Timothy 1 in verse number 1 Paul says

225
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,260
this he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our

226
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,780
Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope we find that Paul understood

227
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,780
something about the ministry he understood that he was called by God and

228
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,860
now as he's giving this word to archivist is he giving this instruction

229
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,020
he says take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord then

230
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:17,300
notice this last phrase that thou fulfill it that thou fulfill it see

231
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:26,060
whether this man quit or was just simply tempted to quit is really not certain in

232
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,540
fact the only two verses of Scripture that we have specifically about this

233
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,700
man archivist or the two that we've looked at this evening Philemon one

234
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,820
verse number two and here in Colossians 4 and verse number 17 theologians of

235
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,540
yesteryear have spun theories about whether or not he quit the ministry and

236
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,260
got off track and so on and so forth the reality is that we don't know factually

237
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,340
biblically speaking but I can tell you this that when you're engaged in

238
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:00,180
spiritual battle when you're a fellow soldier there's some things that come in

239
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:07,580
your life that cause you to consider walking away quitting giving up is it

240
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,180
worth it and Paul whether this one archivist whether he was just facing

241
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,060
this time of maybe difficulty and discouragement maybe he was tempted with

242
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,620
the idea of not continuing it's just not worth it it's too challenging it's too

243
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,060
difficult you don't know what I've had to deal with again we don't know all of

244
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,260
that but Paul having obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit but

245
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,940
having an understanding of this man and in writing this and giving this

246
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:45,420
instruction he says that thou fulfill it the importance of completion the

247
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,500
importance of finishing the importance of understanding that that we that as we

248
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,940
serve God that we're serving God and that as we run our race we're not

249
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,460
running our race to compete against one another we're running our own race and

250
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,380
as we're running our race our goal is to finish in fact Paul said this to the

251
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,540
believers that he is writing to in the region of Galatia of course there's been

252
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,820
many things that had taken place and the Judaizers that came in and all of the

253
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,980
false teaching and he asks him this question he says ye did run well who did

254
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,140
hinder you that you should not obey the truth in Galatians 5 and verse number

255
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:36,220
7 I love the testimony of the Apostle Paul you come to the book of 2nd

256
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,900
Timothy chapter number 4 of course we're familiar with the passage of Scripture

257
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,340
we understand how that he's writing to to Timothy and he begins to share this

258
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,299
testimony of course he's given Timothy these final words of instruction these

259
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,220
words of instruction by the way are are really summed up in in this idea

260
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,140
continue continue I mean if you read the third

261
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,680
chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

262
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,720
you begin to read about the perilous times

263
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,640
that shall come,

264
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
and Paul starts it this way by saying,

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,260
this know also.

266
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,980
Remember, Paul often as he writes,

267
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,060
he will speak of,

268
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,220
you know, I would not that you be ignorant, brother.

269
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,560
I want you to know something.

270
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I want you to be informed of something.

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,980
And here he says to Timothy,

272
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,360
this know also,

273
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,520
then the last days perilous times shall come.

274
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,400
And by the way, he begins to go through

275
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,560
and to explain some of these things

276
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,020
and give some descriptions

277
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,860
as to what would be endured

278
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,780
and what would be experienced.

279
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,320
He tells them in v. 12,

280
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,900
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus

281
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,360
shall suffer persecution.

282
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,900
Can I tell you that the persecution

283
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,440
in which the first century believers

284
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,740
faced and endured

285
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,860
is different than anything any of us

286
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,940
have ever experienced.

287
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,100
He says evil men and seducers

288
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,480
shall wax worse and worse

289
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,560
deceiving and being deceived.

290
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,940
Then notice what he says in v. 14.

291
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,320
But continue.

292
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,560
But continue thou in the things

293
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,940
which thou hast learned and been assured of,

294
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,320
knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

295
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,020
And he goes through and he begins

296
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,320
to give this charge to Timothy

297
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,360
to continue.

298
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,480
Yea, these things are going to happen.

299
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,160
We're going to face opposition.

300
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,240
We're in a battle.

301
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,040
We're in spiritual warfare.

302
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,240
You're a fellow soldier.

303
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,620
I know sometimes in the battle it gets hard.

304
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,160
I know sometimes in the battle

305
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,240
it gets overwhelming.

306
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,960
That thou fulfill it.

307
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,040
Continue.

308
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,740
Be faithful.

309
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,460
The Scriptures speak about being faithful unto death.

310
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,960
Being faithful unto the end.

311
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,380
Paul says this.

312
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,320
He gives him the charge in v. 1 of chapter 4

313
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,460
about preaching the Word of God.

314
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,580
He says in v. 2,

315
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,420
Preach the Word, be instant in season,

316
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort,

317
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,340
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

318
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,460
He tells them, hey, the time's going to come

319
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,720
when they're not going to endure sound doctrine.

320
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,300
Right?

321
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,840
Why?

322
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,300
Because after their own lusts

323
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,600
shall they heap to themselves teachers

324
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,180
having itching ears.

325
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,720
We see this stuff.

326
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,060
I mean, this is where we live.

327
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,900
He says in v. 6

328
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,360
as we get to the point of Paul's testimony,

329
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,120
he had given this instruction to

330
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,460
this one archipis, he says,

331
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,840
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received

332
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,540
in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

333
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,960
And Paul's personal testimony is given to us

334
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,920
in v. 6-7 of 2 Timothy 4,

335
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,080
where I am now ready to be offered.

336
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,660
The time of my departure is at hand.

337
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,360
I have fought a good fight.

338
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,960
I love it.

339
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,180
I have finished my course.

340
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,200
I have kept the faith.

341
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
We're familiar with the verses of Scripture.

342
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,500
We reference them often.

343
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,080
But I want you to really think about

344
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,620
the testimony of Paul.

345
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,120
And I want you to think about

346
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,220
the instruction that he's given

347
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,600
here in Colossians 4 and v. 17

348
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,240
as he's closing this book,

349
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,420
as he's closing, and he mentions

350
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
several people by name,

351
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,380
and he goes through many different attributes

352
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,260
of these people and what they were engaged in

353
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,460
and what they were doing, but he says,

354
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,660
And say to archipis,

355
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,580
Take heed to the ministry

356
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,820
which thou hast received in the Lord,

357
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,780
that thou fulfill it.

358
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
Archipis, don't give up.

359
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,420
You're a fellow soldier.

360
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,320
I know you're in the battle.

361
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,780
Sometimes when you're in the trenches of the battle,

362
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,060
like I've never been a soldier

363
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
in the U.S. Armed Forces of any branch,

364
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
but I can only imagine.

365
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
You read some of those stories

366
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,200
about some of the wars that our nation

367
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,920
has been engaged in throughout our history.

368
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,280
If you're a history buff

369
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,520
and you've read accounts of battles

370
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,440
that have taken place in other portions

371
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,120
of the world history,

372
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,960
and you begin to see what's happening,

373
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,380
and you think about those fellow soldiers,

374
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,480
and you think about some of the things

375
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,040
that they experienced,

376
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,620
some of the difficulties in which they endured,

377
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,120
and Paul says,

378
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,780
Archipis, take heed to this ministry

379
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,500
which you've received in the Lord,

380
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
that thou fulfill it.

381
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,540
I hope this evening

382
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,240
that sometimes when we're engaged in the battle,

383
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,940
we can become overwhelmed.

384
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,460
By the way, if you watch too much news,

385
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,420
you're gonna be overwhelmed in a hurry.

386
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,460
I'm just telling you.

387
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,160
You're gonna be overwhelmed in a hurry.

388
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,060
The enemy wants to get your mind.

389
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,960
It really does.

390
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,260
Can I remind you that we're on the winning side?

391
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,580
We're more than conquerors in Christ,

392
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,140
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

393
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,580
through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen?

394
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,860
We're fellow soldiers.

395
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,180
By the way, I think about this term.

396
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,920
It's been said by many throughout the history,

397
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,940
really, of Christianity

398
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,960
where, I shouldn't say the entire history,

399
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,840
the recent history, I guess I should say it that way,

400
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,680
that far too often as a soldier,

401
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,560
as a fellow believer is wounded

402
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,080
that we kick our own wounded.

403
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,980
It ought not be that way, brethren.

404
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,040
We're fellow soldiers.

405
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,360
We wanna encourage them that thou fulfill it.

406
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,440
See, because you have a race that you're running,

407
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,760
and as we run our race,

408
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,480
we're not competing with one another.

409
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,660
We're simply striving to please him

410
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,020
who's called us to be a soldier.

411
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,580
And what a blessing.

412
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,820
To think about this really obscure Bible character,

413
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,560
archivist, we don't know a whole lot about him,

414
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,380
but Paul says, I wanna get a message to him.

415
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,220
Again, I don't know all of the circumstances

416
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,420
surrounding this man's ministry

417
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,620
and all that he was dealing with,

418
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,260
but can I tell you today,

419
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,580
that I get reports, I get phone calls,

420
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,580
I read articles about people in the ministry

421
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,340
that quit every single day.

422
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,080
Hundreds.

423
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,360
It's sad.

424
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
I don't know the reason for all of them.

425
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,900
There's no way I could.

426
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,940
I don't know the real reason for many of them,

427
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,300
to be real honest with you.

428
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,260
But I do know this.

429
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,500
I've heard people say something like this.

430
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,160
It's just too much.

431
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,700
It's too hard.

432
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,080
I had one man, I tried to encourage him,

433
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,960
and I used this terminology.

434
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,880
He was ready to quit.

435
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,820
I mean, he had dealt with a bad situation.

436
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,520
And I said to this man, as I spoke to him on the phone,

437
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,680
I said, listen, brother, you're at a crossroads.

438
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,060
Don't be discouraged.

439
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,160
Keep your eyes on Jesus.

440
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,960
He's got a plan.

441
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,680
We don't understand all this mess

442
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,380
that you're dealing with right now,

443
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,240
but we know that the enemy's at work.

444
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,560
Keep your eyes on Jesus,

445
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,800
and just understand that you're at a crossroads.

446
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,160
Here's what his words were.

447
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
He said, no, I'm at a dead end.

448
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,480
It hurt.

449
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,460
Because his perspective was, I'm done with this.

450
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,620
It's too much.

451
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,160
And that's exactly what the enemy wants to do.

452
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,020
Right?

453
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,100
That's what he wants to do.

454
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,980
And so Paul says, deliver this message to Archippus.

455
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,240
He's a fellow soldier.

456
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,100
That's how he's identified, but he's instructed.

457
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,980
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received

458
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,720
in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

459
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
Father, we love you.

460
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,020
We thank you for loving us.

461
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,880
God, we thank you for your word.

462
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,480
Lord, we know that we're engaged in spiritual battle

463
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,940
and spiritual warfare.

464
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,160
Lord, we know that you've given us in thy word

465
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,400
truth with regard to the last days

466
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,040
and the things that will endure.

467
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,300
God, I pray that you'd help us to be strong

468
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,540
in the Lord and the power of his might.

469
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,260
Help us, God, to understand that we need

470
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,140
to put on the whole armor of God.

471
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,140
Help us to understand that we wrestle not

472
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,020
against flesh and blood.

473
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,660
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

474
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,619
They're spiritual.

475
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,140
Help us, God, to understand that you

476
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,980
have called us to be a soldier.

477
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,220
Help us to be a good soldier.

478
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,460
Help us to fulfill.

479
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,700
To finish.

480
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,739
To complete our race.

481
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,100
I pray that you would work in each heart,

482
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,340
in each individual.

483
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,440
Lord, help us to just keep our eyes on Jesus.

484
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,559
We know that the enemy is ruthless, relentless.

485
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,460
He's walking about seeking whom he may devour.

486
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,859
But God, we're on the winning side.

487
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,440
More than conquerors through Christ.

488
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,600
Thank you for the victory that is possible

489
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,880
only through the Lord Jesus Christ.

490
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
Work in hearts and lives.

491
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,359
Help us, Lord.

492
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,239
We'll thank you for it.

493
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,559
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
