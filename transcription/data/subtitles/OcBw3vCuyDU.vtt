WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
If you will, and turn to the book of Philemon, and be looking at just a verse of Scripture

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.760
here from the book of Philemon.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.319
And I won't be dealing with the whole thought of that which is developed here in the book

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.319
of Philemon.

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.680
There's only one chapter, so turn to chapter number one, amen?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.719
And we'll look here at just a verse of Scripture.

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:22.760
I hope to be a blessing to you this evening as we think about this truth that is given

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.760
to us.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.479
The Apostle Paul had the privilege to serve in many regions during his ministry.

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.520
In fact, as you trace the steps of Paul, if you begin to look through the book of Acts

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.080
and trace the missionary journeys, the first, second, and third, you begin to see the regions

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.520
in which God enabled and allowed the Apostle Paul to serve and to minister.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.759
And along the way, he had the opportunity to meet a whole lot of people.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.959
And he had people that he was able to meet that, of course, were the enemies, the opposition,

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:54.400
those that opposed him.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.240
And occasionally he mentions those folks, but there are a lot of people that he had

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.520
the opportunity to serve God with.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.360
And as he would serve and as he would minister in various regions, God would allow him to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.319
have those relationships established.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.599
In fact, as you read through the New Testament, and you have the opportunity to read many

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.120
of the books that God has allowed the Apostle Paul to be the human penman of, that you have

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.319
the privilege of reading of several of those names that are mentioned.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.959
In fact, you can look at the end of many of the epistles and see where the Apostle will

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.680
mention people by name, specifically.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.199
Sometimes he gives us some information about them.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:39.279
Sometimes there's not a whole lot that's given to us, but names are provided.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.720
It's interesting if you were to read Romans 16, that is an especially lengthy portion

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.360
of Scripture with a lot of names that are provided of these people that God allowed

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.760
the path of the Apostle Paul to cross with and to serve alongside of.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.760
And of course, in many cases, to minister to them, but also to minister along with them.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.680
The name Archippus is found both here in the book of Philemon.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
It's also found over in the book of Colossians.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.759
And we'll look at both passages of Scripture this evening.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.399
Notice in verse number one of the book of Philemon, the Bible says, Paul, a prisoner

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:19.440
of Jesus Christ, and Timothy, our brother, unto Philemon, our dearly beloved and fellow

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
laborer.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.800
And he says this, and to our beloved Athia and Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.039
the church in thy house, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.039
Christ.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:37.119
Right in the beginning of the letter, we find that God gives us an understanding as to the

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:42.919
time of the writing of this short letter that is sent, of course, to Philemon and also to

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.279
Athia and Archippus, as it's mentioned in verse number two.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:52.039
As we would consider the timing of the letter, he says that Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:57.199
We understand many of the epistles we would refer to as the prison epistles, and this

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:03.320
letter, along with the book of Colossians that we'll reference this evening as well,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.160
they were both written, they're both referred to as these prison epistles that were written

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.440
around the same time from the same location during Paul's first confinement there in Rome.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.360
And so we understand a little bit of background about what God is giving us with regard to

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.160
the timing of the writing and who he's writing to.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.520
We're not going to deal with really the thought and the full message of the book of Philemon.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.600
In fact, if you go back and read through it, you'll see a beautiful picture that is given

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.559
to us with regard to this one on Onesimus and all that took place and how in the past

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.880
he was unprofitable, but now he's profitable.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880
Why?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.880
Because he's been saved.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.199
And great message, but not the message for this evening.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.639
The message for this evening, we're going to focus on this one, Archippus.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.559
Notice the Bible tells us, and we're going to use it for our title this evening, look

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:56.399
at it, it says, and to our beloved Athia, and Archippus, our fellow soldier.

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:01.479
Archippus, our fellow soldier, is the title for the message this evening.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:07.160
I want you to notice, first of all, if you're taking notes, notice how this man is identified.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.559
We've read it there in verse number two, he's identified as a fellow soldier.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.240
I like that terminology.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.760
I like the picture that you get in your mind when you read that description, that identifying

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.000
name title, if you will, that is given.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.279
The Bible says, now, and Archippus, our fellow soldier.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.760
It's interesting to me that the title, if I could use that terminology this evening,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.320
of fellow soldier, that the Apostle Paul only refers to two people in all of the Scriptures

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.920
with that title.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.640
We read about being a good soldier, and so on and so forth, and we'll reference some

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.119
of that this evening, but there are two people specifically that he mentions as being fellow

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.119
soldiers.

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.279
We notice in the first verse of Philemon, that as he speaks about Philemon, he uses

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:03.440
this terminology, our dearly beloved and fellow laborer.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.160
I'm thankful that he was a co-laborer, a fellow laborer, and in that word is used, we find

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.839
that Paul says there in the church in Corinth, as he's ministering to them, of course, the

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.679
divisions and schisms and all that was taking place in Corinth, and I'm of Paul, and I'm

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:23.940
of Cephas, and I'm of Apollos, and so on and so forth, and Paul says, we're just laborers

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.320
together with God.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.880
And in chapter number three of 1 Corinthians, what a great perspective to have.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.640
But this title that we find here that is given as an identifier, if you will, for

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.959
Archippus is fellow soldier.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:43.119
It is used also of speaking of Epaphroditus.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.119
Turn back to the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number two of the book of

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.119
Philippians.

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:53.040
Now, Epaphroditus was a man we believe most likely the pastor of the church there in Philippi.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.160
He speaks about him as being a companion in labor, my brother, but notice in Philippians

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.000
two, in verse number 25, it says, yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.880
my brother and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880
to my wants.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.200
It's commonly believed that as the church at Philippi collected this offering to assist

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.239
the apostle Paul, that it was taken, delivered to Paul by the hand of Epaphroditus, and he

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.959
took that as the messenger of the church, he brought that offering to the apostle Paul,

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.799
and then Paul would deliver this letter back to the church at Philippi by the hands of

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:39.079
Epaphroditus.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:43.480
And we find here that he's referred to as fellow soldier.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.399
And again, it's Epaphroditus and this one, Archippus.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:56.239
It's interesting because this title reveals to me the fact that they were engaged in battle.

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:03.399
You immediately get in your mind when you read that title, that term that is ascribed

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:09.760
to Archippus here, the way in which he's identified, we see this fellow soldier, he's engaged in

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.359
the battle.

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:15.799
The battle that he's engaged in though is a spiritual battle.

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:20.200
And the reality this evening is that each and every one of us are engaged in a spiritual

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.059
battle.

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:26.339
We see this spiritual battle, this spiritual warfare that Paul speaks of to the believers

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.179
in the book of Ephesians there as they're ministering in the city of Ephesus and that

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:34.059
church that is there and ministering and serving.

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:39.619
And Paul tells them, listen, we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:45.480
And the reality is that if you have any sense about you, and I don't say that to be condescending,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.519
you can obviously, without hesitation, identify today that we're in the midst of spiritual

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.519
warfare.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:56.640
I mean, the spiritual battle that is raging.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.200
And we find that this man, Archippus, not to say that others weren't fellow soldiers,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.000
but it's interesting that there's just a couple of people that are given, that are spoken

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.480
of in this term.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.760
You find often that the Apostle Paul, when he speaks about Timothy, how does he refer

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760
to Timothy?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.160
My son in the faith.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.239
He refers to Titus in like manner.

00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:20.519
In fact, he speaks of Onesimus in that fashion as well.

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:23.600
But we find that there's a purpose.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.640
We believe that every word of God is pure.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.239
And the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:37.359
And God led the Apostle Paul to use this term, this title, in identifying this one, Archippus.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:43.099
Now, the reality is that Paul had spoken to Timothy about the importance of understanding

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:47.020
our place as being a soldier and what it means to be a good soldier.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.900
Notice if you will, over in 2 Timothy chapter number 2, I'm going to draw your attention

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.539
quickly this evening to just the first four verses of this passage of Scripture.

00:08:55.539 --> 00:09:00.580
And I want you to just get the instruction that Paul is leaving for Timothy, of course,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.140
by way of preservation for us as well to this day.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.940
He says this in verse number 1 of 2 Timothy 2,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.979
Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:17.380
The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.539
men who shall be able to teach others also.

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:30.840
He says this, Thou, therefore, endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.039
He says, No man that woreth and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:42.280
he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280
Who's that?

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280
Well, that's the Lord.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280
Amen?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.520
You trust that Christ is your personal Savior.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.640
You are enlisted in the Lord's army.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.640
Amen?

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.159
You became a soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:57.799
We find that we sing the song with the kids about being in the Lord's army, right?

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.640
And we have fun with singing that.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.140
We sing.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.180
songs about onward Christian soldier right and we understand some of the

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.300
songwriters that have taken up on this thought of being a soldier and this is

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.740
an analogy an illustration that is used to help us understand this this

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.820
Christian life that we're living in this battle in which were engaged in and Paul

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:29.180
says to Timothy that that you might be a good soldier that you may please him who

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:36.060
have chosen him to be a soldier wonder this evening as we would think about

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:42.180
this title that is given to Archippus in our text of Scripture the way in which

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.820
he is identified I wonder this evening if someone would say of me if someone

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.420
would say of you there are fellow soldier a fellow soldier I wonder this

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:58.340
evening if we understand really the the spiritual warfare in battle that we are

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.620
engaged in the truth of Ephesians 6 is a powerful truth that we must be

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.260
mindful of on a regular basis we spoke of course of the theme for 2019 be

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.980
strong the Lord I preached to the whole book of Ephesians we belabored the point

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.100
but it's good to be reminded of the fact that we're engaged in spiritual warfare

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.660
and we wrestle not against flesh and blood we're to put on the whole armor of

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.460
God by the way that's not a one-and-done situation that is an everyday

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.820
sometimes you might have to go put the armor on again because something

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.860
happened as you were engaged in battle and you you have to understand the

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:44.660
importance of this battle that we're in and Paul says as he refers to this one

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.500
this co-laborer but more than that a fellow soldier we notice how he's

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.700
identified I want you to notice over the book of Colossians how he is instructed

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.220
the book of Colossians gives us some some information at the end of the book

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.140
again I mentioned how that many times I said this by way of introduction that

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.100
you get to the end of some of these epistles that God allowed Paul to be the

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.700
human penman of and you see a reference to a number of individuals people that

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.180
he served and ministered to people that he served alongside of and we find that

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.380
beginning in Colossians 4 and verse number 7 is where you begin to see a

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.740
number of those names that will be mentioned throughout the end of this

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:32.060
particular passage of Scripture names that Paul mentions we get down to verse

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:39.380
number 17 and it says this notice and say to Archippus so so this is this

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.540
interesting to me because really he says just catch it in context notice in verse

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.460
number 7 all my states shall take a kiss declare unto you who is a beloved

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.140
brother and faithful minister and fellow servant the Lord verse 9 with Onesimus a

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.500
faithful and beloved brother who's one of you they shall make known unto all

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.140
things which are done here we see that he mentions about others he goes through

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.060
and he speaks of them favorably and about their labor and their service but

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.220
when he comes to verse number 17 and he's going to speak about Archippus he

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.780
says and say to Archippus there's some instruction that I want to make sure it

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:21.820
gets delivered to this one this fellow soldier that's engaged in the battle

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:27.020
there's some instruction that I want to make sure it gets to him see with the

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.060
other folks that are mentioned there's not necessarily a piece of information

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.060
that is to be given to them as much as there's a description as to how they're

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.180
engaged in the work and what they're doing and their faithfulness and we

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.000
notice that Paul says this notice what he says we're gonna break the statement

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.620
down number one he says take heed to the ministry now we're going to pause

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.540
right there I know that's not the fullness of the thought but we're just

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.300
gonna pause there for just a moment and this idea of taking heed to to discern

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.380
to understand to have a knowledge of and he says take heed but notice what he

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.140
says he could have stopped again every word of God is pure take heed to the

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:16.900
ministry notice how it's described which thou hast received in the Lord now let

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:22.500
me ask you do those words that are given after ministry don't you think

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.980
those are important words he didn't just stop take heed to the ministry he says

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:37.460
take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord I think about

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:42.220
the message that would be delivered I believe that the recipients here would

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.580
have faithfully taken and delivered this message and say to archivist okay here's

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.220
the message for you it's been contained and preserved for us so that we can read

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.700
it and be encouraged by it and be challenged by it but we find that as he

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.460
would receive those words when when it says take heed to the ministry and then

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:07.260
which thou hast received in the Lord it's the Lord that calls us to the

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.460
ministry it's the Lord that equips us for the work of the ministry it's the

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.220
Lord who enables us we find that as we would understand the truth of spiritual

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.140
gifts within the the Church of God and we'd understand how the Holy Spirit of

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:26.780
God gifts each individual believer as he will amen and he's the one that gives

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.500
you and equips you for the work of the ministry for the the work that God has

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:38.260
called us to now this one archivist he may have had a particular position

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.300
there's some that have the idea that he may have been a pastor of a church and

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:48.100
whatever the particular ministry may have been that he was engaged in we find

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.820
that the Apostle Paul in delivering this message of taking heed to the ministry

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.620
which now has received in the Lord is reminding him that he had been called by

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.180
God they've been given this ministry by the Lord I think about the words of Paul

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:08.340
when he says this and and you can just let me read the verse to you but in

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:14.580
first Timothy 1 in verse number 12 Paul says and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:22.660
who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.500
see Paul understood that he was called by God in fact as you read through many

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.580
of the epistles and that that Paul was the human penman for you'll find that he

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.100
references the call that God has placed upon his life in those introductory

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.700
statements in fact here in first Timothy 1 in verse number 1 Paul says

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:47.260
this he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:53.780
Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope we find that Paul understood

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.780
something about the ministry he understood that he was called by God and

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.860
now as he's giving this word to archivist is he giving this instruction

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.020
he says take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord then

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:17.300
notice this last phrase that thou fulfill it that thou fulfill it see

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:26.060
whether this man quit or was just simply tempted to quit is really not certain in

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.540
fact the only two verses of Scripture that we have specifically about this

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.700
man archivist or the two that we've looked at this evening Philemon one

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.820
verse number two and here in Colossians 4 and verse number 17 theologians of

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.540
yesteryear have spun theories about whether or not he quit the ministry and

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.260
got off track and so on and so forth the reality is that we don't know factually

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:54.340
biblically speaking but I can tell you this that when you're engaged in

00:17:54.340 --> 00:18:00.180
spiritual battle when you're a fellow soldier there's some things that come in

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:07.580
your life that cause you to consider walking away quitting giving up is it

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:14.180
worth it and Paul whether this one archivist whether he was just facing

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:20.060
this time of maybe difficulty and discouragement maybe he was tempted with

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.620
the idea of not continuing it's just not worth it it's too challenging it's too

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.060
difficult you don't know what I've had to deal with again we don't know all of

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.260
that but Paul having obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit but

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.940
having an understanding of this man and in writing this and giving this

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:45.420
instruction he says that thou fulfill it the importance of completion the

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.500
importance of finishing the importance of understanding that that we that as we

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.940
serve God that we're serving God and that as we run our race we're not

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.460
running our race to compete against one another we're running our own race and

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:09.380
as we're running our race our goal is to finish in fact Paul said this to the

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:14.540
believers that he is writing to in the region of Galatia of course there's been

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.820
many things that had taken place and the Judaizers that came in and all of the

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.980
false teaching and he asks him this question he says ye did run well who did

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:30.140
hinder you that you should not obey the truth in Galatians 5 and verse number

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:36.220
7 I love the testimony of the Apostle Paul you come to the book of 2nd

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.900
Timothy chapter number 4 of course we're familiar with the passage of Scripture

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.340
we understand how that he's writing to to Timothy and he begins to share this

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.299
testimony of course he's given Timothy these final words of instruction these

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.220
words of instruction by the way are are really summed up in in this idea

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.140
continue continue I mean if you read the third

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.680
chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.720
you begin to read about the perilous times

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.640
that shall come,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.720
and Paul starts it this way by saying,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.260
this know also.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.980
Remember, Paul often as he writes,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.060
he will speak of,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.220
you know, I would not that you be ignorant, brother.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.560
I want you to know something.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.560
I want you to be informed of something.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.980
And here he says to Timothy,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.360
this know also,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.520
then the last days perilous times shall come.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.400
And by the way, he begins to go through

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.560
and to explain some of these things

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.020
and give some descriptions

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.860
as to what would be endured

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.780
and what would be experienced.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.320
He tells them in v. 12,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.900
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.360
shall suffer persecution.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.900
Can I tell you that the persecution

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.440
in which the first century believers

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.740
faced and endured

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.860
is different than anything any of us

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.940
have ever experienced.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.100
He says evil men and seducers

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.480
shall wax worse and worse

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.560
deceiving and being deceived.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.940
Then notice what he says in v. 14.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.320
But continue.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.560
But continue thou in the things

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.940
which thou hast learned and been assured of,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.320
knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.020
And he goes through and he begins

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.320
to give this charge to Timothy

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.360
to continue.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.480
Yea, these things are going to happen.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.160
We're going to face opposition.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.240
We're in a battle.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.040
We're in spiritual warfare.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.240
You're a fellow soldier.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.620
I know sometimes in the battle it gets hard.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.160
I know sometimes in the battle

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.240
it gets overwhelming.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.960
That thou fulfill it.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.040
Continue.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.740
Be faithful.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.460
The Scriptures speak about being faithful unto death.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.960
Being faithful unto the end.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.380
Paul says this.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.320
He gives him the charge in v. 1 of chapter 4

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.460
about preaching the Word of God.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.580
He says in v. 2,

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.420
Preach the Word, be instant in season,

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.420
out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.340
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.460
He tells them, hey, the time's going to come

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.720
when they're not going to endure sound doctrine.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.300
Right?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.840
Why?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.300
Because after their own lusts

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.600
shall they heap to themselves teachers

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.180
having itching ears.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.720
We see this stuff.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.060
I mean, this is where we live.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.900
He says in v. 6

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.360
as we get to the point of Paul's testimony,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.120
he had given this instruction to

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.460
this one archipis, he says,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.840
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.540
in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.960
And Paul's personal testimony is given to us

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.920
in v. 6-7 of 2 Timothy 4,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.080
where I am now ready to be offered.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.660
The time of my departure is at hand.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.360
I have fought a good fight.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.960
I love it.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.180
I have finished my course.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.200
I have kept the faith.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.360
We're familiar with the verses of Scripture.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.500
We reference them often.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.080
But I want you to really think about

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.620
the testimony of Paul.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.120
And I want you to think about

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.220
the instruction that he's given

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.600
here in Colossians 4 and v. 17

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.240
as he's closing this book,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.420
as he's closing, and he mentions

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.820
several people by name,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.380
and he goes through many different attributes

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.260
of these people and what they were engaged in

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.460
and what they were doing, but he says,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.660
And say to archipis,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.580
Take heed to the ministry

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.820
which thou hast received in the Lord,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.780
that thou fulfill it.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.820
Archipis, don't give up.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.420
You're a fellow soldier.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.320
I know you're in the battle.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.780
Sometimes when you're in the trenches of the battle,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.060
like I've never been a soldier

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.360
in the U.S. Armed Forces of any branch,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.440
but I can only imagine.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.120
You read some of those stories

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.200
about some of the wars that our nation

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.920
has been engaged in throughout our history.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.280
If you're a history buff

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.520
and you've read accounts of battles

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.440
that have taken place in other portions

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.120
of the world history,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.960
and you begin to see what's happening,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.380
and you think about those fellow soldiers,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.480
and you think about some of the things

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.040
that they experienced,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.620
some of the difficulties in which they endured,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.120
and Paul says,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.780
Archipis, take heed to this ministry

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.500
which you've received in the Lord,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.500
that thou fulfill it.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.540
I hope this evening

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.240
that sometimes when we're engaged in the battle,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.940
we can become overwhelmed.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.460
By the way, if you watch too much news,

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.420
you're gonna be overwhelmed in a hurry.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.460
I'm just telling you.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.160
You're gonna be overwhelmed in a hurry.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.060
The enemy wants to get your mind.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.960
It really does.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.260
Can I remind you that we're on the winning side?

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.580
We're more than conquerors in Christ,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.140
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.580
through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen?

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.860
We're fellow soldiers.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.180
By the way, I think about this term.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.920
It's been said by many throughout the history,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.940
really, of Christianity

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.960
where, I shouldn't say the entire history,

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.840
the recent history, I guess I should say it that way,

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.680
that far too often as a soldier,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.560
as a fellow believer is wounded

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.080
that we kick our own wounded.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.980
It ought not be that way, brethren.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.040
We're fellow soldiers.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.360
We wanna encourage them that thou fulfill it.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.440
See, because you have a race that you're running,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.760
and as we run our race,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.480
we're not competing with one another.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.660
We're simply striving to please him

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.020
who's called us to be a soldier.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.580
And what a blessing.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.820
To think about this really obscure Bible character,

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.560
archivist, we don't know a whole lot about him,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.380
but Paul says, I wanna get a message to him.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.220
Again, I don't know all of the circumstances

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.420
surrounding this man's ministry

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.620
and all that he was dealing with,

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.260
but can I tell you today,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.580
that I get reports, I get phone calls,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.580
I read articles about people in the ministry

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.340
that quit every single day.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.080
Hundreds.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.360
It's sad.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.420
I don't know the reason for all of them.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.900
There's no way I could.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.940
I don't know the real reason for many of them,

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.300
to be real honest with you.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.260
But I do know this.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.500
I've heard people say something like this.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.160
It's just too much.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.700
It's too hard.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.080
I had one man, I tried to encourage him,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.960
and I used this terminology.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.880
He was ready to quit.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.820
I mean, he had dealt with a bad situation.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.520
And I said to this man, as I spoke to him on the phone,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.680
I said, listen, brother, you're at a crossroads.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.060
Don't be discouraged.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.160
Keep your eyes on Jesus.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.960
He's got a plan.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.680
We don't understand all this mess

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.380
that you're dealing with right now,

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.240
but we know that the enemy's at work.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.560
Keep your eyes on Jesus,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.800
and just understand that you're at a crossroads.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.160
Here's what his words were.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.000
He said, no, I'm at a dead end.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.480
It hurt.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.460
Because his perspective was, I'm done with this.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.620
It's too much.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.160
And that's exactly what the enemy wants to do.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.020
Right?

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.100
That's what he wants to do.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.980
And so Paul says, deliver this message to Archippus.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.240
He's a fellow soldier.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.100
That's how he's identified, but he's instructed.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.980
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.720
in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.560
Father, we love you.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.020
We thank you for loving us.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.880
God, we thank you for your word.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.480
Lord, we know that we're engaged in spiritual battle

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.940
and spiritual warfare.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.160
Lord, we know that you've given us in thy word

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.400
truth with regard to the last days

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.040
and the things that will endure.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.300
God, I pray that you'd help us to be strong

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.540
in the Lord and the power of his might.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.260
Help us, God, to understand that we need

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.140
to put on the whole armor of God.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.140
Help us to understand that we wrestle not

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.020
against flesh and blood.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.660
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.619
They're spiritual.

00:28:46.619 --> 00:28:49.140
Help us, God, to understand that you

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.980
have called us to be a soldier.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.220
Help us to be a good soldier.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.460
Help us to fulfill.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.700
To finish.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.739
To complete our race.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.100
I pray that you would work in each heart,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.340
in each individual.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.440
Lord, help us to just keep our eyes on Jesus.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.559
We know that the enemy is ruthless, relentless.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.460
He's walking about seeking whom he may devour.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.859
But God, we're on the winning side.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.440
More than conquerors through Christ.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.600
Thank you for the victory that is possible

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.880
only through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.960
Work in hearts and lives.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.359
Help us, Lord.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:40.239
We'll thank you for it.

00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:42.559
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
