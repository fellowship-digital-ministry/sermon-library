1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
100 this evening, Psalm 100, and as you're turning to Psalm 100, I'm going to remind

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,199
you of what it is that we've been studying here on Wednesday evenings.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,200
We spent several weeks going through the response of the Lord Jesus Christ to the disciple.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,280
Of course, he speaks to all of the disciples, but there was an individual disciple that

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,879
asked the question, Lord, teach us to pray, as it's recorded in Luke chapter number 11.

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,000
And Jesus said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
be thy name.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,319
Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone

10
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,799
that is indebted to us.

11
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,720
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,400
And as we studied through those few verses of Luke chapter number 11, we learned that

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,200
Jesus, of course, was providing for us not a prayer that we are to just memorize and

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,239
mindlessly repeat and just regularly repeat this prayer, but he was providing for us some

15
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,319
framework, a model of prayer, and we learned as we studied through the portion of Scripture

16
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,559
how that we, as we follow that framework, we're reminded of the relationship that we

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,440
have with the God of the universe, that he is the God of the universe, but he's our Father.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,400
And that relationship through, of course, the atonement, the substitutionary atonement

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,160
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, and we're mindful as we

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,580
look at that model of giving us the framework, if you will, we're reminded of developing

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,900
that spirit of humility and a spirit of reverence, a spirit of, you know, understanding that

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,620
it's God's will, not my will, a spirit of submission to the will of God.

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,099
We're mindful that he is our provider, and what a joy to understand that as we look at

24
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,419
that framework, how God will help us in our prayer lives.

25
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:11,100
In Psalm chapter number 100, we find that, of course, there's great truth in these five

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,380
verses, but we're going to single in specifically on a phrase in verse number four, but I'll

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,820
read the entire chapter.

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,460
It's only five verses.

29
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,419
Psalm 100, the Word of God says,

30
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,259
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

31
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,539
Serve the Lord with gladness.

32
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,740
Come before his presence with singing.

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,500
Know ye that the Lord, he is God.

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,100
It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves.

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,259
We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

36
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,619
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise.

37
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:53,539
Be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

38
00:02:53,539 --> 00:03:02,320
For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, and his truth endureth to all generations.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,100
We understand that, and we'll use as the title, verse number four, the beginning phrase there,

40
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,500
enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,740
In 2 Timothy chapter number three, the apostle Paul is discussing the last days, and as he's

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,619
providing a detailed description of how men will be characterized, one of the terms that

43
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:25,500
he uses in that description is unthankful.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,020
No doubt in our lives, we have encountered some that are unthankful.

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,740
There are individuals in our society today that have this attitude, really, of being

46
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:43,460
entitled, and they deserve, and it's what they're owed, and therefore they have no gratitude.

47
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,460
They're not thankful for the things that they have received, because it's just what's their

48
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,940
due.

49
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,020
And Paul says that amongst a number of other things, one term that will characterize the

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,339
generation in the last days is that they'll be an unthankful people.

51
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:06,500
I hope and trust that it would never be said of God's people that we lack gratitude.

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,059
That we have just an unthankful spirit.

53
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:16,420
No, as we look here and we understand the truth that God has given us throughout his

54
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,059
word, we as the people of God, we ought to be people that are offering thanks and praise

55
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,820
to our God regularly.

56
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,019
And we find that here, the psalmist says, enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

57
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,660
So as we continue to really deal with this thought of our prayer lives, and of course

58
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,739
over the last several weeks, I've made note of the fact that we need a revival of prayer.

59
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:47,459
And we were in a pastor's meeting yesterday, and I had the privilege of preaching, and

60
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,579
Brother Hummel also was preaching from Beacon of Truth Baptist Ministries, we're over at

61
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:56,899
Mike Aylstock's church, and Brother Hummel preached a message from 2 Chronicles 7 and

62
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,019
verse number 14 in dealing with revival.

63
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:04,200
And he asked this question, which was something that I said in the very beginning of this

64
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,980
study with regard to prayer, and needing a revival of prayer in the lives of God's people.

65
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,579
He said, which service in your weekly calendar is the least attended service?

66
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,000
Is it not the prayer meeting?

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,640
And I said this to you before we started, or as we began this study, that has nothing

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,500
to do with COVID, by the way.

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,239
For years and years and years, the least attended service of a Baptist church is the midweek

70
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,200
prayer meeting.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,880
And it's as if we just don't think prayer is important.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,600
And the reality is that there is power in prayer, and the opportunity that we have as

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,679
the people of God to engage in corporate prayer is a precious privilege that we have.

74
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:56,339
And as we look here and we begin to, I guess, go a little bit further than what we've studied

75
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,399
in Luke chapter 11 with regard to our prayer lives, I believe that as we look at this thought

76
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:08,040
this evening, that it is necessary for us to develop a spirit of gratitude in our prayer

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,559
lives.

78
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:15,000
And I said often, as we studied over the last few weeks, that prayer is not us bringing

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,320
some grocery list of needs to God.

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,440
It's muchâ€”we're communing with our Father.

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,579
We're having the privilege of entering into His presence, and it's not just some list

82
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:32,859
of needs or demands, but it's the fact that we have the privilege of fellowshipping with

83
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,320
our Savior.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,760
And what a great joy that is.

85
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,640
And we see here that it says, enter into His gates with thanksgiving.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,600
I have made it a practice in my life, in my prayer life, that I begin with thanksgiving.

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I begin with praise.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,000
And I have sought to, in my life, follow really the model that we see in Psalm 150, if you

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,559
want to turn over there.

90
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:04,880
In Psalm 150, of course, a psalm, not a very lengthy psalm again, but a psalm that deals

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,079
with praising God.

92
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,880
And here in this psalm, and beginning in verse number 1, it says, praise ye the Lord, praise

93
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,200
God in His sanctuary.

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,320
Praise Him in the firmament of His power.

95
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,359
Praise Him for His mighty acts.

96
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:20,200
Praise Him according to His excellent greatness, verse 3.

97
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,359
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet.

98
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,040
Praise Him with the psaltery and harp.

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance.

100
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Praise Him with stringed instruments and organs.

101
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,799
Praise Him upon the loud cymbals.

102
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,799
Praise Him upon the high-sounding cymbals.

103
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,079
Everything that hath breath, praise the Lord.

104
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,399
Praise ye the Lord.

105
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,480
There's a lot of praise in there, amen?

106
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,859
And giving thanks.

107
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:48,320
We understand, as New Testament believers, we have been given the truth and really the

108
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,200
admonition, the instruction, that we are to be a thankful people.

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,079
Paul said this in Ephesians 5, in verse number 20, giving thanks always for all things unto

110
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,119
God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

111
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:08,519
In Philippians chapter number 4, in verse number 6, Paul says, be careful for nothing,

112
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,820
but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,640
known unto God.

114
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,160
And then, of course, we're familiar with what Paul says to the church in Thessalonica in

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,200
1 Thessalonians 5, in verse number 18, in everything give thanks, for this is the will

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,200
of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,840
I'd like to just share some thoughts with you this evening with regard to enter into

118
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,159
His gates with thanksgiving.

119
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,799
From this thought in Psalm 100, in verse number 4, and from the, really, the formula, if you

120
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,780
will, that I find in Psalm 150, in verse number 2, where the Bible says, praise Him for His

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,679
mighty acts, praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

122
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,960
I'm really going to take Psalm 150, in verse number 2, and use it in reverse order.

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,159
What are we to thank God for?

124
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,039
Number one, I thank God for who He is.

125
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,039
I thank God for who He is.

126
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,340
And you've heard me say this over the years, but it's certainly worth repeating when we

127
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:17,320
deal with the fact that when we learn to praise and thank God for who He is, we will never

128
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,719
lack reason to rejoice, we will never lack reason to give thanks.

129
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,719
Why?

130
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,479
Because our God never changes.

131
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,520
He's always the same.

132
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
He is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

133
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,039
He is immutable, and we're so thankful for that.

134
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm just going to go through the list quickly.

135
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I jotted down 20 things.

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,520
You say, man, I don't have enough room for that.

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Write small.

138
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
I did.

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,880
And I'm not going to give you verses for everything, we're not going to go look at all the verses,

140
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
but I could give you verses for each of these.

141
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,919
But when I think about thanking God for who He is, think about this.

142
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,919
Our God is holy.

143
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,919
He's holy.

144
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,140
You know, you ought to thank God that He's holy.

145
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,020
The psalmist said that we're to give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.

146
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Our God's not becoming...

147
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,820
He's unholy. He is holy.

148
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,780
He's just.

149
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Aren't you thankful that our God is just?

150
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,500
He's holy. He's just.

151
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,880
He's righteous.

152
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,140
These are the attributes,

153
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,020
the characteristic traits that we find

154
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,300
of our God as we study the Word of God

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
and we begin to dive in

156
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,020
and begin to look at who He is

157
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,140
and how He has revealed Himself to us.

158
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,380
So we thank God for who He is.

159
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,460
That He's holy. He's just. He's righteous.

160
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,660
I'm thankful that He's eternal.

161
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
He's Alpha and Omega. The beginning and the end.

162
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,220
The first and the last.

163
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,740
The reality is that we serve a God

164
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,140
who transcends time.

165
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,580
He's outside of time.

166
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,300
He's always relevant.

167
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
His Word is always relevant

168
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,780
because He's eternal.

169
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,540
And we find that we ought to rejoice

170
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,300
in understanding, giving thanks

171
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
that our God is eternal.

172
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,420
He's omnipotent.

173
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,660
He has all power.

174
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,060
There's nothing too hard for our God.

175
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,780
Nothing.

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,060
We ought to thank Him for that.

177
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,420
Not only is He omnipotent,

178
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
He's omniscient.

179
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,100
He knows all things.

180
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
We read throughout the Scriptures

181
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,220
about the omniscience of God.

182
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,100
We see it displayed in the life

183
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ

184
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,300
when individuals are there

185
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,060
listening and trying to find

186
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,700
and catch Jesus in some kind of a trap.

187
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,180
And He understands and He challenges them

188
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,940
on their very thoughts.

189
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,780
He knows all things.

190
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,180
He's omnipresent.

191
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,460
He said that He'll never leave us

192
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,860
nor forsake us.

193
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,580
He's with us.

194
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,980
What a joy. What a blessing.

195
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,140
He's gracious.

196
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,220
Aren't you thankful for the grace of God?

197
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,500
We think about His grace.

198
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,740
We sing about amazing grace.

199
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,380
Grace greater than all our sin.

200
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,780
Where sin did abound,

201
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,300
grace was more.

202
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,100
Aren't you thankful for the grace of God

203
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,260
that He is gracious?

204
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
He's merciful.

205
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,820
He's merciful.

206
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,620
His mercy endureth forever.

207
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,740
We find that as we study the Word of God

208
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,980
that He's compassionate.

209
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,140
He's compassionate.

210
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,340
You know, on a number of occasions,

211
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,260
you'll read throughout the New Testament

212
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,860
with regard to the life and ministry

213
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,940
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

214
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,340
that the Bible says that He was moved

215
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,060
with compassion.

216
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
He was moved with compassion.

217
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,140
He was compassionate.

218
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,260
Our God is faithful.

219
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
Faithful is He that calleth you

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,540
and also will do it.

221
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,940
1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 24.

222
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,260
We understand that our God is faithful.

223
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,940
He's trustworthy. He's dependable.

224
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,380
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

225
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,660
Thanking God for who He is.

226
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,580
He's my rock.

227
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,300
He's my rock.

228
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,620
He's my refuge.

229
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,220
We spoke about that on Sunday.

230
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,700
We looked at that truth from Psalm 62.

231
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,460
Pour out your heart before Him.

232
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,020
And the psalmist said He is a refuge for us.

233
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,620
Shelter.

234
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,740
What a joy to know that He is my refuge.

235
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,100
He's my shield.

236
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,540
Buckler is a word that you'll often see

237
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,740
throughout the Psalms

238
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
dealing with the fact that He's our shield.

239
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,500
He's our buckler.

240
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm thankful that He's my helper.

241
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,100
He's my helper.

242
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,220
He is a very present help in a time of trouble.

243
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
We, of course, spoke last year

244
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,900
throughout the book of Hebrews

245
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
looking unto Jesus.

246
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,620
And we said this,

247
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,300
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills

248
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,740
from whence cometh my help.

249
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,980
My help cometh from the Lord

250
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,540
who made heaven and earth.

251
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,500
The Lord is our helper.

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,980
You know, He's my great High Priest.

253
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,220
You think about the truth

254
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,140
and the book of Hebrews.

255
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,380
We looked at it extensively last year.

256
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,900
That He is the great High Priest.

257
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,740
He is my great High Priest.

258
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,980
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

259
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,580
We find that He is the Creator.

260
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,780
Not only is He the Creator,

261
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,060
but He is the sustainer of all things.

262
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,620
We find that He is the Redeemer.

263
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,620
I shall say He is my Redeemer.

264
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,420
I would say this,

265
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,100
as we think about who He is,

266
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,180
He is my Shepherd.

267
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,780
He's my Shepherd.

268
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,460
Of course, we understand there are many things

269
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,740
that go along with that.

270
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,140
And if I could sum up the list

271
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,060
of all of those points

272
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,620
that I made quickly this evening,

273
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,660
I would say He is my all in all.

274
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,060
He's everything that we need Him to be.

275
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,820
Remember when he spoke to Moses

276
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
and gave Moses the responsibility

277
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
of going and speaking to Pharaoh

278
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,780
and giving deliverance to the people of God.

279
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,020
Moses asked the question,

280
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,100
whom shall I say sent me?

281
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,500
He says, I Am.

282
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,380
I Am that I Am.

283
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,100
And what is God saying?

284
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,740
We've often heard a preacher of yesteryear

285
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,620
perhaps say, I am whatever you need me to be.

286
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,500
He's God. He's our God.

287
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,420
And I went through that list very quickly this evening

288
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,300
and the reality is that I don't believe

289
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,980
there's one amongst us

290
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,500
that did not know one of those characteristics

291
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,980
or attributes of God.

292
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,500
I've preached messages on these attributes of God.

293
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,900
I've taught them over the years.

294
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,220
You're familiar with them.

295
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,180
But I wonder this evening,

296
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,260
and I'm not going to ask you to try to call you out,

297
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,700
but how many of those things did you thank God for today?

298
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,100
How many of those things did you thank God for this week?

299
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,780
How many of those things did you thank God for this month?

300
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,860
You understand what I'm saying?

301
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,140
We're to give thanks.

302
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,980
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

303
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,700
We look at Psalm 150 in verse number two.

304
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,100
It says at the end of the verse,

305
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,100
praise him according to his excellent greatness.

306
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,340
The Psalmist says in Psalm 135,

307
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,300
I know that the Lord is great.

308
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
If I were to ask you when you came into the service

309
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,940
this evening, do you know that God is great?

310
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,300
I think every one of you would have said,

311
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
absolutely God is great.

312
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

313
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,740
Amen?

314
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,580
He's great.

315
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,340
He's a great God.

316
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,780
He's our God.

317
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,100
If I were to ask you, is he holy?

318
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,940
Is he just?

319
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,780
Is he righteous?

320
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,900
Is he all of these things?

321
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,860
Oh yes, yes, yes.

322
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,260
But do we thank him for it?

323
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,820
Are we mindful of who he is?

324
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,700
And are we rejoicing?

325
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,220
Are we thanking him?

326
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,220
See, here's what I find in my own personal prayer life

327
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,860
is that when I begin my prayer time

328
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,740
with this spirit of thanksgiving,

329
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,860
when I enter into his presence

330
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,060
with just praising him and thanking him for who he is,

331
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,020
and in my mind, I begin to go through

332
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,620
these attributes of God.

333
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,660
And I may not mention every attribute of God.

334
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,540
It may be that I get looking at certain ones

335
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,380
and what have you.

336
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,060
But as I begin to get into that spirit of gratitude

337
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,020
and thanking him for who he is,

338
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,740
it really takes my prayer time

339
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,540
in a completely different direction.

340
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,100
As I'm just standing in awe of our God

341
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,020
and how wonderful he is.

342
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,940
See, this evening,

343
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,020
we think about prayer.

344
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,260
We think about our prayer lives

345
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,900
and this revival of prayer.

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,740
Oh, that we would get to the place

347
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,060
where we're entering into his gates with thanksgiving.

348
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,100
That we're not just entering into his gates

349
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,100
with a list of our needs and our wants and our desires,

350
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,500
but that we enter into his gates with thanksgiving

351
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,900
and praising him for who he is.

352
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
He's a great God.

353
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,460
Not only for who he is,

354
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,940
but for what he does.

355
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,380
We notice in verse number two,

356
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,940
it says, praise him for his mighty acts.

357
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,500
You know, we ought to thank God for who he is.

358
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
And as we thank God for who he is,

359
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,700
we find that he never changes.

360
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,260
So we can always thank him for those things.

361
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,460
His attributes, his characteristics

362
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,220
that we find throughout the word of God.

363
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,940
But then we think about thanking God for what he does.

364
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,100
I would say this,

365
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I've only listed 10 things this evening

366
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,460
for this particular point of thanking God for what he does.

367
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,380
I'm just trying to give you a little sampling this evening

368
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,260
to get your mind kind of thinking in this regard.

369
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,500
So that as you enter into your time of prayer,

370
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,700
that you're entering into his gates with thanksgiving.

371
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
You're saying, look at all these things

372
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,020
I have to be thankful for.

373
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,340
I mean, I just start getting full of thanksgiving

374
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,580
and praising God.

375
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,580
And it just certainly brings me into a place of worship.

376
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,300
But we thank God for what he does.

377
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
You know, he saves.

378
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,180
Aren't you thankful that he's the redeemer?

379
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,580
He's your savior.

380
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,020
He saved you.

381
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,340
But he didn't just save you,

382
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,660
he has the power to save others.

383
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,340
And we think about that salvation that he offers,

384
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,540
that he is the savior of the world.

385
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,540
And what a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ

386
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
is our personal savior.

387
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,020
Not only does he save, but he provides.

388
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,260
We mentioned in that list of who he is,

389
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,739
that he is my shepherd.

390
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,700
We understand the Bible teaches us

391
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,179
that he is the good shepherd.

392
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,700
He's the chief shepherd.

393
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,100
But what a joy to know as the psalmist said in Psalm 23,

394
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,940
the Lord is my shepherd.

395
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,980
And as the shepherd, he provides for us.

396
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,780
We mentioned as we looked at that passage

397
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,739
in Luke 11, give us day by day our daily bread.

398
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:16,220
And we understand that as we would pray

399
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,900
and understand through the model of that framework,

400
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,179
and we would be mindful of the provision of God,

401
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,140
the way that he provides for us.

402
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm thankful that he protects.

403
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,780
The protection of God.

404
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,380
You know, there are times in which he protects you,

405
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,780
and you don't even know what he's protecting you from.

406
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,300
Someone came into church on Sunday morning

407
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,900
and said they almost got in a car wreck on the way.

408
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,860
And it was a really tough situation.

409
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,340
So thank God for his protection.

410
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,820
Thank God for his protection.

411
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm thankful that he, I'll say this,

412
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,260
he develops his children.

413
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,340
And now the reality is that there are times

414
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,059
in which the process of being developed

415
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,319
and being conformed in the image of His Son

416
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,799
according to Romans 8 and verse 28 and 29,

417
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,639
it's not always a pleasant process.

418
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,159
It's not always the enjoyable process of being developed,

419
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,519
but the reality is that we understand

420
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,479
that our God is developing us.

421
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,779
He's growing us.

422
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,019
He's helping us to become all that we're to be in Christ.

423
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:22,859
What a blessing.

424
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:25,559
I'm thankful that He's interested

425
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,479
in doing a work in our lives individually.

426
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,039
We sing the song with the children.

427
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,399
He's still working on me, right?

428
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,479
He made all the world.

429
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,799
He created all that there is,

430
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,199
but He's still working on me.

431
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,639
He did all of that in six days, amen?

432
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,359
Genesis chapter number one.

433
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,759
But man, He's still working on us,

434
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,559
and I'm thankful for the way in which God develops us.

435
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,079
I'm thankful for the way in which He delivers us.

436
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,639
You know, the reality is that He provides deliverance.

437
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,799
I mentioned on Sunday,

438
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,319
when I'm preaching through Psalm 62 there,

439
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,360
that the psalmist often, as you find

440
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,239
throughout the book of Psalms,

441
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,079
when he uses the word salvation,

442
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,040
he's not talking about soul redemption salvation,

443
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,519
but deliverance from some trial, some trouble,

444
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,839
some difficulty.

445
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm thankful for the way in which God delivers us

446
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,659
as His people.

447
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,439
I'm thankful that He answers prayer.

448
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,399
Aren't you thankful that our God answers prayer?

449
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:27,519
There was a fellow yesterday

450
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,119
that I sent a text message to.

451
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,279
He's not a member of our church.

452
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,000
He's never been to our church,

453
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,879
but I met him a number of years ago,

454
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,599
and I saw him recently,

455
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,159
and he mentioned something to me that was going on,

456
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,239
and I told him, I said,

457
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,639
brother, I'll be praying for you, and I did.

458
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,239
I saw him on a particular day,

459
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,639
and over the next few days, I prayed for him,

460
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,079
and there was, the particular thing was yesterday,

461
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,839
and I prayed for him specifically yesterday morning,

462
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,040
and I sent him a text and said,

463
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,399
brother, I just want you to know I'm praying for you,

464
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,720
and last night, he sent me a text,

465
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,720
and he said, you have no idea how blessed we are

466
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,839
to serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

467
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,639
He said it was just about four minutes

468
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:12,619
from when the thing was due, and nothing was working.

469
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,199
It was all messed up,

470
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:19,880
and I was just about to give up, and then God answered.

471
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,720
He said, thank you for praying.

472
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
Now, that was an encouragement to me.

473
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,319
The reality is I don't even know

474
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,039
what really he was dealing with.

475
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
I don't know all of the details of it,

476
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,000
but I just prayed and said, God, would you help him,

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,639
and he gave me that testimony back

478
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,440
of how God answers prayer, and I replied to him,

479
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,520
and I said, what a joy to know

480
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,720
that our God hears and answers prayer,

481
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,239
and he said, indeed, he does,

482
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,880
and we were encouraged, one with another,

483
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,319
last night, over text message

484
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,160
because we serve a God who hears and answers prayer,

485
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,179
what he does.

486
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,360
You know, he teaches.

487
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:56,039
He teaches us the word of God.

488
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,759
The psalmist prays throughout the Psalms.

489
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,599
You can find many references when he says,

490
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,119
teach me thy way, O Lord.

491
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,619
We find that one of the ministries

492
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,000
of the Holy Spirit of God is to be the divine teacher.

493
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,959
There are times in which we have individuals

494
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,800
that would perhaps say something of,

495
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,199
I don't understand this, I don't know what this means.

496
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,459
I'm having a difficulty with understanding

497
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:20,899
this passage of Scripture.

498
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,479
I'm so thankful that God is our teacher,

499
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,739
that he teaches us his word.

500
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,339
The psalmist said in Psalm 86,

501
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,639
teach me thy way, O Lord.

502
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:33,139
I will walk in thy truth.

503
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,660
I'm always convicted by that verse of Scripture,

504
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,899
Psalm 86 and verse 11, because really,

505
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,860
what we find that the psalmist is saying,

506
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,259
he has this desire to be taught the way of the Lord,

507
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:49,220
but he makes this commitment to walk in truth.

508
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,860
When God teaches us his word,

509
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,500
we ought to obey his word,

510
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,899
to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

511
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,020
He enables us.

512
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,319
I think about Paul when he shares testimony

513
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,380
about the ministry that he was entrusted with

514
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,979
and the privilege that he understood

515
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,899
was his to be able to serve the Lord God of the universe.

516
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,580
And he says this in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 12,

517
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,619
and I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord,

518
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:18,139
who hath enabled me,

519
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,739
for that he counted me faithful,

520
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:22,019
putting me into the ministry.

521
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,619
He enables.

522
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:28,619
I'll say this, he chastens, he corrects us.

523
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,260
You say, I don't know if I'm thankful for that.

524
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,480
You ought to be, you ought to be.

525
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,139
We ought to thank God that he loves us enough

526
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,000
to correct us, to chasten us.

527
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,059
The Bible says whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, right?

528
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,019
Is that not what the word of God says?

529
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,059
And so we ought to thank God when he corrects us,

530
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,500
when he chastens us.

531
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,459
We ought to thank God when the word of God convicts us.

532
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:55,459
What a blessing and what a joy

533
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:59,260
that the Holy Spirit of God would be working in our lives,

534
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,579
using his word and the chastening and the correction

535
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:06,820
that God brings in the lives of his people.

536
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,459
I'm so thankful that our God chastens

537
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,139
and that he corrects us as his people.

538
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,339
I would say this, I'm thankful for what he does.

539
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,500
I'm thankful that he is the preserver of Scripture.

540
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,380
We know that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

541
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,380
but God said in Psalm 12 that he would preserve his word.

542
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,500
And I'm so thankful that he has.

543
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,299
And one of the truths that I understand

544
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,540
and I've shared with you often

545
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,299
is that really everything that I shared with you this evening

546
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,320
is the result of the fact that God has preserved this book.

547
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,059
If he had not preserved this book,

548
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,839
we would not know that he's holy.

549
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:45,019
We would not know that he's just or righteous

550
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,339
or I mean, all of the other attributes

551
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,299
that I mentioned this evening,

552
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,980
we wouldn't know if he did not preserve his word.

553
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,619
And so I just wanna challenge you this evening,

554
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,980
simple thought tonight,

555
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,380
enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

556
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,139
I mean, we're to be a thankful people.

557
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:02,579
And I didn't even get into all the other things

558
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,119
that we should be thankful for.

559
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,019
But if we just start with these things,

560
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:11,059
if we start with thanking God for who he is,

561
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,880
thanking God for what he does,

562
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,519
entering into his gates with thanksgiving.

563
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,519
And I would challenge you this evening,

564
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,679
maybe you'd say, yes, pastor, when I prayed this morning,

565
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,359
man, I had a great season of praising and thanking God

566
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,760
and being mindful of who he is and his attributes.

567
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,040
And man, I just was standing in awe of God.

568
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,279
It was awesome.

569
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,679
Praise the Lord.

570
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,899
But maybe for some,

571
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,000
that entering into his gates with thanksgiving

572
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
has kind of been missing.

573
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,639
Maybe we have not been as thankful as we ought to be.

574
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,239
Maybe we have not been worshiping

575
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,399
and praising our God, thanking him.

576
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:55,399
The believer, we have been given a command to give thanks.

577
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,880
But really, when we understand all that he is

578
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,239
and all that he has done,

579
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:02,119
we really shouldn't even need a command to give thanks.

580
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,079
We ought to just be thankful.

581
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,160
Amen?

582
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,440
You know, we find in the nation of Israel,

583
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,480
throughout the Old Testament, something very interesting.

584
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,480
They were a people that loved to complain and murmur.

585
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,779
I like the word murmur.

586
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,160
I think it's kind of a word that helps us understand

587
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,000
how bad it is when we complain, murmur.

588
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,679
And they were always murmuring and complaining.

589
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,679
God provided miraculously for them bread every day.

590
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,839
And they said, we hate this bread.

591
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,279
Right?

592
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,440
They just had something to complain about all the time.

593
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I trust that it would not be said of us as the people of God

594
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,839
that we would be a complaining people,

595
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,459
but that we'd be a thankful people.

596
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:55,760
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

597
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
We need to develop a spirit,

598
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,160
an attitude of gratitude in our prayer lives.

599
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,200
And I believe when we begin that way,

600
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,880
it's really going to transform

601
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,079
the entirety of your prayer time.

602
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,359
It's going to cause you to have a different perspective

603
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,380
because you're seeing God and seeing him

604
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,119
for who he really is and all of his beauty

605
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,079
and all of his greatness.

606
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,559
And I'm so thankful that God has given us this book

607
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
that has revealed those things to us.

608
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,239
And so as we seek to have a revival of prayer,

609
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:32,719
I trust that we would enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

610
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,599
Father, we love you.

611
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,840
We thank you for loving us.

612
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
We thank you for the privilege,

613
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
being able to spend just a little bit of time this evening,

614
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,919
quickly going over a number of attributes,

615
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,799
who you are and some things that you've done.

616
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,000
No doubt, the list is nowhere near exhaustive.

617
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,539
We could add and add and add to this list.

618
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,679
The purpose, however, this evening is to help us develop

619
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,640
this attitude of gratitude in our prayer lives,

620
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,679
the spirit of thankfulness

621
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,840
that we would enter into your gates with thanksgiving,

622
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,479
that we would, in everything, give thanks,

623
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,520
understanding that this is the will of God

624
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,320
and Christ Jesus concerning us.

625
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,679
Help us to be a thankful people.

626
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,239
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

627
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:24,359
Help us, Lord, to exalt you and magnify you.

628
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,080
We thank you that you do hear and answer prayer.

629
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,279
We pray that you'd be glorified

630
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,080
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
