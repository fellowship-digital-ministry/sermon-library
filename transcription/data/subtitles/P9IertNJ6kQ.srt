1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm just going to let you know at the very beginning I am not planning to read the entire chapter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You can go back and read it later if you'd like.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm not reading the entire chapter because there's about 400 names in this chapter.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And I do my best to not get tongue-tied.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But with this list of so many, repeated, repeated, repeated,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll just avoid publicly reading the entirety of the text this evening.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I hope that you will be okay with that tonight.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Genesis chapter number 10, if you're looking at verses 1 through 32,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
obviously, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we find that really it's going to provide us with a list of the descendants of Noah,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
really the generations of the sons of Noah.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This often has been referred to, this text of Scripture has been referred to as the table of nations.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And you'll recall, if you actually hold your place there in chapter number 10,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
turn back to chapter number 4, if you will.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And as we studied through the book of Genesis, as we came to the fourth chapter,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and really beginning in verse number 17, down through verse number 24,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the Bible provided us with a list of the descendants of Cain.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We find that as we enter into chapter number 5 of the book of Genesis

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and look at the entirety of this fifth chapter,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that God provides us with the generations of Adam.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And really, we find this list that is provided in Genesis chapter number 5,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
taking us from Adam to Noah through Seth.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And now, as we study the 10th chapter of the book of Genesis,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we come and we find that in verse number 1, the Bible says,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now these are the generations of the son of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And unto them were sons born after the flood.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And so we see here the generations of the sons of Noah.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want you to notice how that verse number 1 and verse number 32,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the first and last verse of this chapter,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
really provide us with a level of insight as to the reason

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that this quote-unquote list is provided to us.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We find, as I've read already in verse number 1, it says,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And unto them were sons born after the flood.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Notice in verse number 32, the Bible says,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These are the families of the sons of Noah.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After their generations in their nations.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's interesting, as we study the 10th chapter of the book of Genesis,

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and then, of course, we'll be getting into the 11th chapter in our next study

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and looking at the first nine verses of chapter number 11.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And obviously, we're familiar with Genesis chapter number 11

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
being the account of the Tower of Babel and the disbursement and so on and so forth.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And really, as we begin to look at what's happening between Genesis 10

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the first nine verses of Genesis chapter number 11,

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we find that Genesis 10 is providing us with an overview of the disbursement,

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
while Genesis chapter number 11 is going to provide us with the details.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The reason why, and all of that sort of thing,

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and we'll see that in the first nine verses as to how God gives us that information.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As we're looking here in Genesis chapter number 10,

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and looking at the division, I'm going to make several comments.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll give you an outline. The title is adopted from verse number 32,

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and I've simply titled the message this evening,

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The Nations Divided After the Flood.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Nations Divided After the Flood.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In verses one through five, if you're taking notes,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you'll see, first of all, the sons of Japheth.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The Bible tells us, in verse number one,

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that these are the generations of the sons of Noah.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And then it tells us, in verse number two,

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the sons of Japheth, and it begins to give us this list.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I want you to pay attention and notice, in verse number five,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
pay attention to the wording that's used here.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Bible says, in verse number five,

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
by these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Again, as we look at the 10th chapter,

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and then look at the truth of the 11th chapter,

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
with the Tower of Babel and the disbursement,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
we find that chapter 10 is providing us with this overview,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and then giving us more details in chapter number 11

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
as to the cause and what God did there in chapter number 11.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But as we look here at the sons of Japheth,

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
as it's given to us in verses one through five,

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we notice the terminology in verse number five,

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
specifically when it talks about the isles of the Gentiles,

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and we would find that the descendants, if you will,

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of the sons of Japheth would primarily be those Gentile nations

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that were settled both north and west of Canaan.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And these are the nations that are being referenced here

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in verses one through five as we look at the sons of Japheth.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We then move into verses six through 20.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Number two, if you're taking notes, you say you're going fast.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I know. We're going to dig into some things

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
as we get into the second and third point here.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The second list that is provided to us are the sons of Ham.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You'll notice in verse number six that the Bible begins,

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and the sons of Ham, Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan,

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and then it ends in verse number 20 by telling us

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
these are the sons of Ham after their families,

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's very interesting as we look at this portion of Genesis chapter number 10

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and looking at verses six through 20 with the descendants,

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the sons of Ham, that there is one particular individual

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that is given reference in verses eight through 12,

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
specifically highlighted as Nimrod.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Notice with me in verse number eight, the Bible says,

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and Cush begat Nimrod.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He began to be a mighty one in the earth.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord,

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
wherefore it is said, even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and Erech, and Eichad, and Calna, and the land of Shinar.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And the land went forth Asher, and builded Nineveh,

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and the city of Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Between Nineveh and Calah the same is a great city.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
As we look at those verses, and God gives us some specific reference

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to this one Nimrod, and him being specifically highlighted,

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
we would understand a couple of things.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Number one, he was a prominent figure, and he established a great empire.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And as we would begin to think about the empire that was created,

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we find really that the Bible would give us in verse number ten,

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it says, and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We find that these four cities that are mentioned in verse number ten,

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that were cities in the land of Shinar,

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that this became really the center place for the Babylonian kingdom.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And we understand as we study through the history of the Bible,

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and we look at Bible history and begin to trace the steps of Israel,

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and so on and so forth, we understand that Babylon played a very pivotal role

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in the world history events surrounding the nation of Israel, God's people.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And so we find here that the Bible says that these four cities,

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
according to verse number ten, that it was the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Of course, when we enter into chapter number eleven,

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
we begin to see the truth with regard to Babel there as well.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now it's interesting to note that the Bible mentions to us about this man Nimrod,

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and how that he would establish these great kingdoms.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We notice in verse number four that of Babel,

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but notice in verse number eleven, excuse me, verse number ten,

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but then you look in verse number eleven to see the second of these four cities

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that set up really this next area.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Notice it says this, out of that land went forth Asher.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now that's the same Hebrew word that we understand as being Assyria.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And we understand that as we look at the text of Scripture

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and understanding really the generations and the timelines that would pass,

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
how the places, maybe the names of the places would slightly deviate,

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and so on and so forth, but this is Assyria.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The Bible says, builded Nineveh.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We know that Nineveh was the capital of Assyria.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And as we understand that as God would later use Jonah,

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
remember he was going to go to Nineveh, right?

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He was the prophet of God that was being sent to Nineveh.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And during that time, the Assyrians were really the world power.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The Assyrians would soon conquer Israel, the ten tribes of the north,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and we understand the Assyrian captivity that is recorded in the Scriptures.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And Jonah was called to go to Nineveh,

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and of course we know that he didn't go immediately, right?

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He decided that he'd pay a fare and he'd get on a boat and go elsewhere.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And yet God dealt with Jonah.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Eventually Jonah goes to Nineveh, that great city,

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
cries against it, they have revival.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But we understand the wickedness of the people of Nineveh

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
at that particular time in history and understand a little bit

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
as to what's going on in the heart of Jonah

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
there with regard to going to Nineveh.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And so we see that Nineveh is mentioned in verse number 11,

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
it then says the city of Rehoboth and Calah,

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and then it mentions the fourth city, Resin, there in verse number 12.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And so we see that as we look at the sons of Ham

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that are outlined for us in verses 6 through 20,

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that the Bible tells us, specifically kind of hones in, if you will,

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
on this man Nimrod as being this mighty one.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The Bible uses the phrase in verse number 8

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Again in verse number 9, he was a mighty hunter before the Lord.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And it says that even is Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This man, really the idea of verses 8 and 9

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
was the prominence that he had

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and the strength that he was establishing for himself and for his kingdom.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,119
And so we see the reference that is given here with regard to this one

170
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,640
Nimrod. It's actually interesting, you don't need to turn there, but I'm gonna

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,079
reference a passage of Scripture over in the book of Micah, and we find that in

172
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,600
Micah chapter number 5 that the Bible is mentioning, we often reference chapter

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
number 5 in verse number 2 with the prophecy that Jesus, the Messiah, would be

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,639
born in Bethlehem, but it's an interesting reference in Micah 5 in

175
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,799
verse number 6 where the Bible says, and they shall waste the land of Assyria

176
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,159
with the sword and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof. Now I want you to

177
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,080
understand something, when we're looking at this passage of Scripture in Genesis

178
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,599
chapter number 10, this is obviously Moses the human penman to the Pentateuch

179
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:53,319
and so on and so forth. Early history of mankind, we understand as we mentioned

180
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,400
the death of Noah as it's recorded at the end of chapter number 9, that he

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,559
lived 350 years after the flood, we noted that he died at 950 years old, that

182
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,239
the earth at that time was about 2,000 years old, but then you go forward to the

183
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:16,400
time of Micah when he's prophesying, it's somewhere around the 700 BC timeline

184
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,720
when he's prophesying. The Bible tells us in the beginning of the book the kings

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,239
that were ruling during his time, in fact it was during the time of King Ahaz when

186
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:31,360
the Assyrians would take captive the nation of Israel, and it is still

187
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,720
referred to by the prophet Micah as being the land of Nimrod in the

188
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,879
entrances thereof. And once again as we've mentioned throughout our study so

189
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,279
far of the book of Genesis, and really we've made mention many times about the

190
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,559
foundational nature of the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis and how

191
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,919
important the foundation is and how many people are attacking the foundation

192
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,599
of Genesis 1 through 11. They're seeking to undermine the teaching that we find

193
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:10,679
here within the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis for the purpose of then

194
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,440
unraveling the whole of Scripture. But it's interesting to me that even while

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Micah is prophesying that he mentions about the land of Nimrod dealing with

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,839
Assyria, and we come all the way back here to Genesis 10 and we see about this

197
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,639
one Nimrod and we see that these two empires, if you will, the Babylonian

198
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,440
Empire and the Assyrian Empire being mentioned in verses 10 and verse number

199
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,360
11. Also contained within the passage of Scripture in this second section with

200
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,240
the sons of Ham are the descendants of Canaan. Now I made mention of this in our

201
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,039
last study in Genesis chapter number 9 when we talked about the prophecy of

202
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,199
Noah in verses 25 through 27 of Genesis chapter number 9, and we made note that

203
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,520
there was a curse with regard to Canaan. In fact, if you look back in chapter

204
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,360
number 9, you find that in verse number 25 that Noah said,

205
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,800
"...cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." The

206
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Canaanites were known for their wickedness and their immorality, and we

207
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,279
find that this list of the descendants of Canaan that is given, of course he is

208
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,600
a son of Ham, which is a son of Noah, but we see here that the sons of Canaan, that

209
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,440
list begins for us in verse number 15 and goes right down through verse number

210
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,240
19. When you begin to see what is said here in these verses of Scripture, some

211
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,320
of these names will be familiar to you as to the people groups that you see

212
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,600
inhabiting the land of Canaan at the time of the possession led by

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,320
Joshua as the children of Israel went into the land of promise. Notice in verse

214
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,240
15, "...and Canaan begat Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, and the Jebusite." You heard

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,600
about the Sidonians, you heard about the Jebusites, it says, "...and the Amorite, the

216
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,720
Gergesite, the Hivite, the Archite, the Sinite, and the Arvidite, and the

217
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,600
Zemurite, and the Hamathite, and afterward were the families of the Canaanites

218
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,980
spread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou

219
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,320
comest to Gerir, unto Gaza, as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Adma and

220
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Zeboiom, even unto Lashon." And so we find that here in the section, the second

221
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,839
section here of Genesis chapter number 10, in giving us the generations of the

222
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
sons of Noah, we see first of all the sons of Japheth, we then see the sons of

223
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,000
Ham. Within the context of these verses with regard to the sons of Ham, we're

224
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,760
given specific mention to that of Nimrod, and we also are reminded about the

225
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,079
Canaanite nations or peoples that had been referenced back in chapter number

226
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,839
9. Now as we move into the latter section of Genesis chapter number 10, number 3

227
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,559
this evening, the sons of Shem. In verses 21 down through verse number 31, God

228
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,040
gives us the record of the sons of Shem. It tells us in verse number 21,

229
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,720
unto Shem also, and then we find that all of these are going to be referenced, the

230
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth, the elder, even to him

231
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,359
were children born. Notice verse 31, these are the sons of Shem, after their

232
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:30,279
families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. And so we find

233
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:36,279
here the sons of Shem that are listed, and again it's interesting to know, as we

234
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:40,440
look at verse number 25 within the context of the sons of Shem that are

235
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,880
listed, notice what the Bible says, and unto Eber were born two sons, the name of

236
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,640
the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided, and his brother's name

237
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,799
was Joktan. And as we look at verse number 25 and we see that phrase, for in

238
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,959
his days was the earth divided, we certainly believe that what is

239
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,040
referenced in chapter 11, in verse number 9 specifically, when it says

240
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,480
therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there

241
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,679
confound the language of all the earth, and from thence did the Lord scatter

242
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,679
them abroad upon the face of all the earth. And it's interesting as we look at

243
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,920
this table of nations that it's often been referred to in chapter number 10 of

244
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,880
the book of Genesis, and we understand that here in verses 21 through 31 that

245
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,799
the sons of Shem are listed for us. The thing that is interesting about that is

246
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,839
that if you look over, and I'm not going to read it in its entirety, but if you

247
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,399
look over to chapter number 11 and you look at verses 10 through 26, the Bible

248
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:51,600
begins in verse number 10 by saying this, these are the generations of Shem. Now we

249
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
just read in chapter number 10 in verses 21 through 31 unto Shem also, and the

250
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,760
list is provided of the descendants, and it tells us in verse number 31, these

251
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,720
are the sons of Shem. I want you to notice the importance of what is given

252
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,959
to us as we will move into chapter number 11 and deal with it in more

253
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,519
detail in an upcoming message, but we find that in chapter number 11 in verses

254
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,079
10 through 26 that what's happening is we then see how that the descendants of

255
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,320
Shem are again found, the generations of Shem given to us in this passage of

256
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,200
Scripture, and as we end the section in verse number 26, notice the Bible says

257
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:40,959
and Terah lived 70 years and begat who? Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And so what's

258
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:46,279
going to happen as we look at this passage of Scripture in Genesis

259
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,679
chapter 11 and verses 10 through 26, what we see is going to happen is that

260
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,160
really this then becomes the lineage of Christ and what is now in view and

261
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,200
becomes the focal point of the historical record of the Bible. In

262
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,279
Genesis chapter number 10 we're given this broad overview of all of the

263
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:12,320
descendants, the generations of Noah. It says this, now these are the

264
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,640
generations of the sons of Noah, and there's 70 of them in

265
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
the text, and you look at these 70 different references that are given and

266
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,279
you see the overall dividing and the people groups, right, of all of the

267
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,520
world, but you find that as we come to chapter number 11 that God is going to, on

268
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,159
purpose, He's going to zero in and focus upon the line of Shem as we mentioned in

269
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:45,599
our previous study, that we mentioned how that the Noah, during that prophecy of

270
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:51,119
Noah, that He blessed the Lord God of Shem, and we mentioned how that the Jews

271
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,640
are Semitic, they're from the line of Shem, and it's the Messianic line, and we

272
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,320
would find that in chapter number 11 that God takes the focus, if you will,

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,919
all the way down to Abram, and of course Abram becomes who? Abraham, right, the

274
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,280
father of the nation of Israel, right, the Hebrew nation. And we see that from

275
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,919
Genesis, really the end of chapter 11, as it gives us a few overview

276
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,520
statements about the heritage, the family of Abram, if you will, but then starting

277
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,960
in chapter number 12, you find that what God is doing is He's giving us that

278
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,799
truth with regard to the lineage of Christ and the way in which God

279
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,239
would fulfill, by the way, the prophecy that was given in Genesis chapter number

280
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,159
3. And you'll be reminded of that prophecy, I referenced it this morning as

281
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,719
well, but in Genesis 3 and verse number 15, God said this,

282
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:52,640
I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed,

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,039
it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Who is the seed? It's

284
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,359
Jesus, Messiah.

285
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,799
we understand that Abraham is given a promise of a seed and a land, we understand both of those,

286
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,799
but we understand that as we interpret the promise of a seed that is given to Abraham,

287
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,359
and we rightly interpret that with the book of Galatians, that he said he didn't say

288
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:26,239
seeds as of many, he said seed as in one, that is Christ. And what a blessing to see how that

289
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:33,439
the Bible will give us and zero in, focus upon the truths, the historical record that God would

290
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:40,799
give us with regard to His people, Israel, and then of course the Messianic line. Throughout

291
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,079
the remaining history that is recorded in the Bible, of course the Old Testament provides with

292
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,719
us much historical content, we find that really as we look at all of the history that's given,

293
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:59,679
it's how other people groups will interact with God's people. You will read of other nations and

294
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,639
other groups of people and you'll read of them, but you're really reading of them as how they

295
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:11,119
interact with the people of God. And of course the line going down through all the way through

296
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,559
the Old Testament, of course leading to Messiah, we understand even as we've mentioned in some

297
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,359
books like the book of Esther how that Haman had such hatred for the people of God, the Israelites,

298
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,879
he wanted to kill them. It wasn't so much that it was just Mordecai, he wanted to get rid of

299
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:35,839
Mordecai, but also the entire nation of Israel. We see the enemy at work, right? The enemy is trying

300
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,919
to destroy the line by which Messiah would come. We know that he did not succeed, we know that

301
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,199
Messiah came, amen, and what a blessing that is. So as we look at Genesis chapter number 10 and we

302
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:52,639
look at this passage and we see the breakdown that is given to us, I want to focus back as we kind of

303
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:57,839
conclude this evening verses 1 and 32 of Genesis chapter number 10, and I want to take a couple of

304
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:04,799
takeaways. Let me read the two verses to you again and give some takeaways from this passage. Verse

305
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,279
number one of Genesis 10, now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and

306
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:18,399
Japheth, and unto them were sons born after the flood. Notice verse 32, these are the families of the

307
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:24,959
sons of Noah after their generations and their nations, and by these were the nations divided

308
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:31,999
in the earth after the flood. Number one takeaway that I want you to see is in both verse number one

309
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:39,759
and verse number 32, there's a phrase that is used that says, after the flood. What is it that God is

310
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,639
reminding us of that there was a global flood? We understand that as we looked at these previous

311
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:53,439
passages of scripture in Genesis chapter number 4, in Genesis chapter number 5, about the

312
00:22:53,439 --> 00:23:00,559
generations that were provided to us, we find that we come to the time of Noah. Genesis 5

313
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,199
ends with the line of Noah, Noah being 500 years old at that particular time, and then we find that

314
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:13,759
Genesis 6, 7, and 8 deal with the global flood. Chapter number 9, of course, the Noahic Covenant, we

315
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,199
dealt with that, but we come to chapter number 10, and on both the first and last verse of this passage

316
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:26,479
of scripture, the Bible uses after the flood. You understand that there are many people today that

317
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:33,199
deny the global flood. There are people today that would deny the fact that there was a Noah's

318
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:40,879
flood. In fact, depending on the company that you are with, if you were to mention something about

319
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:46,479
the flood of Noah's day, there would be some that would mock you for even believing such a thing.

320
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,639
It's just reality. That's what we live in today. There have been mockers and scoffers, but we

321
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:59,119
understand that this is nothing new. Amen? Because here, let me remind you of what Peter said in

322
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:05,599
2 Peter chapter 3, and this is exactly what was happening during that particular time. In 2 Peter

323
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:13,759
chapter number 3, we find that Peter specifically is going to make mention about those scoffers that

324
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,959
would come in the last days. It says this in verse number 3 of 2 Peter chapter number 3,

325
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:26,399
knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust.

326
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:34,879
And here's what they're going to say. Where is the promise of his coming? It's interesting that they

327
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:41,839
understand, as far as the truth that Peter is giving us, that they understand that Jesus

328
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,599
said that he was coming again.

329
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,479
It says this in verse number 4, for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they

330
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:57,679
were from the beginning of the creation. But what does Peter do? He says in verse number 5, for this,

331
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:06,000
they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God, the heavens were of old, and the earth

332
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,719
standing out of the water and in the water, verse 6, whereby the world that then was being

333
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:19,039
overflowed with water perished. What is Peter talking about? He's talking about the global flood.

334
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:26,559
He's talking about the flood of Noah's day, Genesis 6 through 8. And we find here, Peter will make

335
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,359
mention of this as well in his first epistle, and we'll look at that in just a moment, but it is

336
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,000
interesting that as you study the 10th chapter of the book of Genesis, and you think about this

337
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,079
that is given to us here in this passage, by these were the nations divided, and we see that they

338
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:51,359
were divided after the flood. These are the sons that were born after the flood. What did God tell

339
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,759
Noah and his sons as soon as they got off the ark? Remember, as soon as they got off the ark,

340
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,399
the first thing they did was what? They made an offering. We mentioned about the importance of

341
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:05,919
understanding first things first. There was a matter of priority, and that was worship. That's

342
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,399
exactly what they did. But as you come into the ninth chapter of the book of Genesis, you find that

343
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,639
God gives them instruction. It says, God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful

344
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:23,679
and multiply and replenish the earth. So not only do we find in Genesis chapter number 10 that there

345
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,639
is the truth of a global flood, we find that Noah and his sons, they obeyed the instruction of the

346
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:37,919
Lord. He said, be fruitful and multiply, and we find that God blessed them. No doubt he is the

347
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,000
giver of life, and we find that he blessed them, and they did in fact replenish the earth. And it

348
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,319
is interesting as we understand that at the time in which we're looking at this particular era,

349
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:57,519
and we look at the phrases again in verse one and verse number 32, it says the sons of Noah

350
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:03,279
after their generations. It says in verse number one, it lists the sons of Noah specifically Shem,

351
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,839
Ham, and Japheth. You understand at the end of the flood, there were only eight human beings

352
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:15,759
who survived. That's it. Noah, Mrs. Noah. Everyone says, what was Noah's wife's name? I don't know.

353
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:25,039
No idea. The people out at Answers in Genesis, if you go to the Ark out there, the Ark Encounter,

354
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:32,959
they have given Noah's wife a name. What is it? Emzara. And we first walked in, and I said,

355
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:36,879
Emzara? I'm like, man, I never knew what her name was. I'm trying to find out where it is in the

356
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:41,839
Bible, you know? And then they said, right underneath of it, they said, we really don't

357
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:49,199
know what her name is, but we've just given her a name. So Noah and Mrs. Noah, right? Japheth and

358
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:55,439
Mrs. Japheth, Ham, Mrs. Ham, Shem, and Mrs. Shem. There are eight people that come off of the Ark.

359
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,679
Not only do we know that from the account in Genesis, but I want you to look at 1 Peter,

360
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,519
chapter number three. We looked at 2 Peter, chapter number three a moment ago to see how

361
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,479
that Peter referenced the truth of a global flood. He references that in 1 Peter, chapter number three

362
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:15,359
as well, but he gives us this additional truth with regard to the fact that there are only eight

363
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:21,679
human beings that survived. In 1 Peter, chapter number three, in verse number 20, the Bible says

364
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,719
this, which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah,

365
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:38,159
while the Ark was a preparing wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

366
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,279
There were eight human beings, Noah and his wife, his three sons, and their wives. We made mention,

367
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,760
and we find that in Genesis, as we look in chapters six, seven, and eight,

368
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,599
the Bible tells us how that all man died. In fact, in Genesis, chapter number seven, in verse number

369
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,640
21, the Bible says, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle and of

370
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,559
beasts and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man. Noah was a preacher

371
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,599
of righteousness. He didn't have very many people that followed the message that he gave, correct?

372
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:24,799
We find that the Bible tells us, as we look in Genesis, chapter number seven, how that God

373
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,320
shut them in. It tells us in Genesis seven, in verse number 16, and they that went in went in,

374
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
male and female of all flesh, but who went in from a human perspective? It was only Noah, his wife,

375
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,039
his three sons, and their wives, and only human beings to enter the Ark. And it was God that shut them in.

376
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:51,440
And we find that the Bible tells us that every man died during the flood. And then we come to

377
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Genesis, chapter number 10, and we see that the Bible tells us not only that there was a global flood,

378
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,279
but we see once again that there were only eight human beings that survived.

379
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,999
you say pastor we know this why are we why are we dealing with this I've had

380
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:09,919
people ask me questions such as this couldn't there have been another group

381
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,879
of people somewhere else on the earth no if there were God would have told us if

382
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:21,519
you want to go back even further than that from Noah I've had people ask me

383
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,099
this question and they've said it this way how many Adams do you think there

384
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:31,499
were like say this again I mean if you look at the New Testament truth of the

385
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,739
second Adam speaking of Christ you know I understand what you're speaking of

386
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:42,459
but they were asking in the in the sense of how many Adams Genesis did God create

387
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:47,979
did he create multitudes of atoms and scatter them all over the earth and no

388
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:54,539
he created one there was one Adam and he saw that he needed a help mate so what

389
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,459
did he do made Eve and he brought Eve to her right we understand that and it's

390
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,459
important because what's happening is there are so many people that are

391
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:07,299
attacking the foundation of our Bible and here's what they try to do if this

392
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:13,259
can't be trusted if Genesis 1 through 11 can't be trusted then how can you know

393
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:19,739
that John 316 can be trusted now you say wow we we fast-forwarded a lot that's

394
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:25,219
what they want to do okay they don't do it that quickly but that's exactly what

395
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:29,219
they want to do they want to systematically break down the

396
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:33,699
Scriptures they want to undermine what God says they want to provide whatever

397
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:38,379
types of quote-unquote evidences they might have and they try to break down

398
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:42,979
undermine the truth of God's Word so that they eventually can get to the

399
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:49,659
point of Romans 1 where there really is no God so we see that it's important

400
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,219
that we understand and really at the the the book ends of this chapter verse

401
00:31:54,219 --> 00:32:00,019
1 and verse 32 that were reminded that there was a flood reminded there are

402
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:04,259
only eight human beings that survived that flood and they only survived

403
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:10,379
because they got on the ark and God protected them reminded of one final

404
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:15,619
truth as we look in Genesis 10 verse 1 and verse 32 notice the Bible says in

405
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:19,139
verse number one now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem and

406
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:23,459
Ham a Shem Ham and Japheth excuse me and unto them were sons born after the

407
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:27,619
flood verse 32 these are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations

408
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:34,939
in their nations notice by these who is these that's the eight human being the

409
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:41,939
sons right specifically the six Shem Ham Japheth and their wives it says by these

410
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:47,579
were the nations divided in the earth after the flood and so we find that the

411
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:53,099
Bible teaching that we see in Genesis chapter 10 verses 1 and 32 obviously the

412
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:57,539
details are provided to us as with regard to the the generations and the

413
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,179
descendants of these sons the Bible tells us not only that there was a

414
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,739
global flood not only that they were obedient not only that there were just

415
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:10,099
simply eight human beings that survived we find that there's only one human race

416
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:15,099
there's only one human race I mentioned this last week actually I didn't preach

417
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:19,259
from Genesis last week so it was a couple of weeks ago when I preached in

418
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,539
chapter number nine but we find that in chapter number nine look back if you

419
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,699
will it might be on the same page for you it's on a previous page for me but

420
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:31,459
look back at Genesis 9 in verse number 19 it's very similar to what we read in

421
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:35,059
chapter number 32 of chapter 10 where the Bible says these are the three sons

422
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:41,779
of Noah and of them was the whole earth overspread so it's important that we

423
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:47,419
understand there's only one human race we find that all people every human

424
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:53,619
being trace we trace our heritage to the same family we understand that here in

425
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:57,219
the passage of Scripture that God would give us that truth and speak to us about

426
00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:02,059
that but I want you to notice the truth that Paul would share that is consistent

427
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,179
with what we find in the book of Genesis here in the 10th chapter and

428
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:10,219
even if you would drill back further to Adam and Eve obviously by them you

429
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,899
eventually get to Noah and then of course everyone's killed during the

430
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,179
flood and so we retrace back to just Noah at that particular point in Acts

431
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:24,619
chapter number 17 now understand in Acts chapter number 17 the Apostle Paul had

432
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:29,619
been faithful preaching he had been in various cities preaching the Word of God

433
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,779
and dealing with great levels of persecution and opposition the Bible

434
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:38,459
tells us that they were to leave Berea and they took Paul and they were going

435
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:42,379
to send him to Athens and they were gonna send him there for the purpose of

436
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,979
kind of getting some rest if you will and the Apostle Paul is there in Athens

437
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:51,659
and the Bible tells us in verse number 16 of Acts 17 that now while Paul waited

438
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,859
for them in Athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city

439
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,299
wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the

440
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,739
Jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with

441
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:09,539
him we don't read the entirety of the passage but we find that the Apostle

442
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:15,499
Paul he sees that Athens is a city that is wholly given to idolatry he mentions

443
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:18,859
as he's preaching he stood in the midst of Mars Hill if you skip down to verse

444
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,979
22 you can see the reference there and he says of them he says I perceive that

445
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:27,419
in all things you're too superstitious he tells him in verse number 23 he says

446
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:33,059
I pass by and behold beheld excuse me your devotions I found an altar with

447
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:39,259
this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him

448
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:47,859
declare I unto you so God is using the Apostle Paul in the city of Athens a

449
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:54,219
city that was wholly given to idolatry a city that had all of these these false

450
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:59,819
gods these idols they had all of these these altars if you will and they had

451
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:04,659
this altar with the inscription to the unknown God and Paul says I'm gonna

452
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:09,179
declare him unto you and I want you to understand where Paul begins in verse

453
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:16,379
number 24 he says God that made the world and all things therein what does

454
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:23,299
Paul go back to Genesis 1 right God's the Creator so let me go all the way

455
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:28,619
back to Genesis chapter 1 because I'm gonna declare this God Jehovah I'm gonna

456
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,019
declare him unto you I'm gonna reveal to you who he is I'm gonna make him known

457
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:40,899
make Christ known we find that this this passage would record for us the way in

458
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:44,739
which Paul deals with it he says seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth

459
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:49,579
dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men's hands

460
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:53,939
as though he needed anything saying he giveth to all life and breath and all

461
00:36:53,939 --> 00:37:01,259
things verse 26 and that's made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on

462
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:04,619
all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed

463
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:11,899
and the bounds of their habitation we really look here in in Acts chapter 17

464
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:17,739
and we see how that the truth of what we find back in the book of Genesis with

465
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:24,499
regard to the overspreading of the earth the population after the flood that

466
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:27,819
which is recorded for us in Genesis chapter number 10 we see that the

467
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:33,419
Apostle Paul as he's preaching to the people in Athens he absolutely without

468
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:38,979
any doubt whatsoever is really confirming for us the truth that we find

469
00:37:38,979 --> 00:37:42,379
the book of Genesis he's going all the way back and he's saying listen there's

470
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:47,339
he's made of all nations one blood and so we find that as we look here in

471
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:52,379
Genesis chapter number 10 that yes we find this record of the generations of

472
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:57,059
the sons of Noah and we find that we can go through and we can begin to look at

473
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,259
all of the names and try to determine the particular people groups throughout

474
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:06,259
history and kind of see the areas in which they were divided and moved to

475
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:10,339
according to that which took place in Genesis chapter 11 we see some of the

476
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:14,459
highlights that are given with regard to some of the individuals that are

477
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,979
mentioned but we find that as we would take away from this passage of scripture

478
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:24,619
that we must be reminded there was indeed a global flood don't let the

479
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:33,259
scoffers cause you to doubt what God has given us in his word you give an inch

480
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:38,179
and they're gonna take a mile just the way it's gonna work and so we must

481
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:42,659
stand on the truth of the fact that yes there was a flood it's recorded in six

482
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,259
through eight but we find it referenced here in verse 1 and 32 of our text not

483
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:49,459
only that there are eight human beings that survived they were obedient to the

484
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:53,699
command that God gave in Genesis chapter 9 and there is one human race and all of

485
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:59,419
us every single one of us trace our heritage to the same family if we take a

486
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:05,619
biblical approach it solves a lot of the world's problems amen all of them thank

487
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:12,619
you because Jesus is the answer right what is our God is a God of order I

488
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:19,259
believe that he's not the author of confusion right he's a God of order and

489
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:24,259
we find that as a God of orders you begin to study here in Genesis and other

490
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:29,339
portions of scripture you find that there's order in creation you find that

491
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:35,459
there's order in the institutions that he established there's order in the

492
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:41,659
home God established order there's order in government by the way God ordained

493
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:47,299
government and he gave instruction in order for government and we find that

494
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:52,539
there is order for the church God ordained the church and he gave

495
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,539
instruction yeah Paul says to Timothy that thou oughtest that thou knowest how

496
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:03,179
thou oughtest to behave thyself in the church of God which is the the ground

497
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,979
and pillar of the truth.

498
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:07,979
And so we find that God is a God of order.

499
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:15,579
The enemy, Satan, is the author of confusion, chaos, right?

500
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,199
And so we see the chaos and confusion that exists in our world today,

501
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,059
and we find that it can only be perpetuated at the rate in which it's perpetuated

502
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:30,939
because there's an ignorance to the truth of the author of this book.

503
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:35,579
And when we understand the author of this book, that he is a God of order,

504
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,419
and we understand that Jesus is the answer

505
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:43,819
and that every one of man's problems are solved by the truth of the Word of God,

506
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:48,219
we can come to an agreement that all of that chaos and confusion

507
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,499
can only be dealt with with turning to the Word of God.

508
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:57,419
What's happening in the midst of great levels of chaos and confusion

509
00:40:57,419 --> 00:41:04,659
are people trying to perpetuate their solutions, man's solutions.

510
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:10,379
Man's solutions, carnal solutions, cannot solve a heart problem.

511
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,459
It's just not possible.

512
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:18,859
You cannot, we find as we look throughout the time of Israel and Judah,

513
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:22,259
and we see the indictments that are laid against them by the prophets

514
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:28,339
and God speaking to them betimes and telling them how that they called evil good and good evil,

515
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:33,459
and you see all of the things that were going on in the nation of Israel and Judah

516
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:38,219
and all of the wickedness, and we find that the answer is a heart issue.

517
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:42,699
Last week I preached a message, the heart of the matter is a matter of the heart.

518
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,339
As we look here in Genesis chapter number 10,

519
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:52,179
we find that God gives us important truth.

520
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:58,499
See, when we walk away from the Bible, we cause ourselves more problems.

521
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:03,579
And when we try to then solve those problems apart from the Bible,

522
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:08,219
we just continue to flounder around.

523
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:09,819
And so we must have an agreement.

524
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,699
I've often said this, that as Baptist people,

525
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:16,219
we would say if someone were to ask us what our distinctives are,

526
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:22,019
that we would say first and foremost that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

527
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,819
Let's meet at the Word of God.

528
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:30,099
Right? What's the problem? What's the issue? What are we trying to deal with?

529
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,539
Okay, let's see what God says.

530
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:36,219
And we take what God says and we just follow it.

531
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,059
Well, that doesn't work. Wrong.

532
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,699
Why? The Bible transcends time, right?

533
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,979
It's an eternal book.

534
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,739
It's cross-cultural.

535
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:49,019
Can I tell you that the Bible is not an American book?

536
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,179
I shared this with somebody yesterday.

537
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,579
I was having a conversation with someone and I said,

538
00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:01,779
you know, the Bible wasn't written after the United States of America was set up as a nation.

539
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:08,859
The Bible wasn't the result of having a constitution, a bill of rights, amendments, so on and so forth.

540
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:13,739
The Bible was written well, well, well before that. Amen?

541
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,619
And so therefore, the truth of this book works anywhere

542
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,379
because it's cross-cultural, it's eternal.

543
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:26,819
And so we must determine that we say, okay, what are the problems in our world today?

544
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:31,019
Are there some problems in our nation today with regard to partiality?

545
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:33,819
Absolutely.

546
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,339
The Bible tells us we're all of one blood.

547
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,739
It solves it. Amen?

548
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:43,859
It solves it that fast.

549
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,139
But man has taken a different approach.

550
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:53,859
And we understand that it is important that we agree with God, that we agree with God.

551
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:58,139
God said it, that settles it. Right?

552
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:03,059
Somebody interjected in between there, God said it, I believe it, that settles it.

553
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:09,179
That's a problem because whether you believe it or not, if God said it, that settles it.

554
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,219
You can say, well, I'll tell you what my experience was. I don't care.

555
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,339
God said it, that settles it.

556
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:21,899
You say, man, I'm not being unkind, I'm just saying the Bible is the Bible. Amen?

557
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:27,899
And what God said is what God said, and He said what He meant to say. Amen?

558
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,940
You ever say something and say, man, that didn't come out right?

559
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,619
If you've never said anything that didn't come out the way that you meant to do it, try preaching.

560
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,739
Amen? Because you say a whole lot of things.

561
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:43,899
But the reality is that God is perfect.

562
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:48,059
Every word of God is pure. Amen?

563
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,459
And so God gives us the answers, and I'm so thankful for that.

564
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:56,859
Genesis chapter number 10, we'll get into chapter number 11 next week looking at the Tower of Babel.

565
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:59,899
Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us.

566
00:44:59,899 --> 00:45:03,419
We thank you for the Word of God. We thank you for the truth that's contained therein.

567
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:08,859
We thank you for the table of nations, if you will, that is provided to us here in chapter number 10

568
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,820
that gives us the generations of the sons of Noah.

569
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,779
We thank you for how you've provided us with this detail, and we thank you for the reminders,

570
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:22,619
the principles that we find there in verse number 1 and verse number 32.

571
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:30,619
God, I pray that you'd help us to believe your Word, to practice your Word, to live by your Word.

572
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:35,100
We know that the Bible has the answer for man's problems.

573
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:41,419
The problems in our nation, in our world, are many.

574
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:44,779
God, I pray that you would help us as your people

575
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:52,220
to take the approach of answering those questions with what thus saith the Lord.

576
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,660
We thank you for giving us the Bible. We thank you for allowing us to have it.

577
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,660
It's been perfectly preserved for us, and what a joy that is.

578
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:09,660
I pray that you'd help us to be, as we've often been referred to in years gone by, people of the book.

579
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,779
Pray that you'd have your will and way in our hearts this night, and we'll thank you for it.

580
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:14,779
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

581
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:16,619
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

582
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:17,660
We'll have a brief invitation.
