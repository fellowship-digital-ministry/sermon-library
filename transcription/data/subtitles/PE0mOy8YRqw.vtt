WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
And we ought to praise Him with every breath that He's given us.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.719
What a blessing.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.600
Thank the Lord for His goodness in our lives.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.359
First Timothy chapter number two, some of you have already worked on First Timothy 315,

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.399
our memory verse for the month of March.

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:19.200
It's only March the third, and some have said, I got a long time to work on it.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.000
Some have said, I got it, I'm working on it, I'm in the process.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.600
And so I hope that you will spend time this morning, we're going to be looking at First

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.940
Timothy 2.8, which was our memory verse for the month of February.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.840
And many of you memorized it in the month of February, rehearsed it during Sunday school

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.400
many times, and even last Wednesday evening rehearsed it.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.639
And First Timothy 2.8, the Bible says this, I will therefore that men pray everywhere

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:49.040
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.680
Obviously as we look at this text of scripture in First Timothy chapter two, we find that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.560
the subject matter of prayer is obvious and evident.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.040
We've understood that even in our message last week, that in the midst of this exhortation

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.620
on prayer and the importance of prayer, that God gives us, He reveals to us three aspects

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.000
of His will for humanity.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.559
And we dealt with that last Sunday morning, that God's will is for lost people to be saved,

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:19.319
God's will is for saved people to grow spiritually, and God's will is for saved people to share

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.919
the gospel.

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:24.800
And so we dealt with that last week, and I said this in the message last week, it was

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.879
almost like it's a parenthetical statement within the exhortation that's given to us

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.919
on prayer, and we find that the emphasis is here on prayer.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:40.160
The subject of prayer is vital, and every believer must determine to spend time with

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.519
God in prayer.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.519
The emphasis is obvious, the examples are abundant.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:50.080
As you study the scriptures, you find that there's many examples of God's people who

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
prayed.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.559
Jesus left us an example that we should follow His steps, and regularly in His life, in His

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:59.239
earthly ministry, He prayed, leaving us that example.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.279
And we find this morning, that as we look at this text of scripture, and we come to

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:10.600
verse number eight, I look at it really as three prerequisites that God gives us for

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.679
effectual prayer.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.000
I've titled the message this morning, Effectual Prayer, and the reality this morning is I'm

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.320
not interested in simply going through the motions.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.720
I'm not interested this morning when we talk about prayer as it being simply a religious

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720
exercise.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.080
We understand that as we approach the Lord, that we want to approach Him properly, that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.320
I desire to commune with Him, He is my Father.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.800
What a blessing and privilege it is that we can enter into His presence, and I want to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.000
see God answer prayer in my life.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.759
Have you seen God answer prayer in your life?

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:51.160
In a very specific situation this week that came up on Thursday, and it was just kind

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.320
of a real bother for me, and I just prayed, and I said, God, would you just deal with

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
this?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.360
I don't have the ability to deal with this, God, would you deal with it?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.080
And with just a matter of hours, God dealt with it, and I was rejoicing, I was so thankful

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080
for it.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.520
It was a little thing, maybe somebody would say, but it's a big thing to me, and I appreciate

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.039
that we can enter into the presence of God.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.440
But when we think about prerequisites, if you will, for effectual prayer, we understand

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.600
and we're reminded that in James 5 and verse 16, the end of the verse says, the effectual,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.000
fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.839
You know, during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, there were many who prayed,

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.559
but not all the prayers were effectual prayers.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.160
Amen?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.199
During the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, He looked at some of the religious

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.080
leaders of the day, those that could wax eloquent, those that could stand and could

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.000
just give order as they would give a presence of their ability to speak, and people would

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.360
listen to their prayers and they would stand in awe, if you will, and Jesus said, no, listen,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.100
when you pray, don't pray like the publicans, don't pray like, excuse me, like the Pharisees

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.399
or like the Sadducees, like these religious leaders, why?

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.080
Because they're not praying in the appropriate manner.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.639
Notice in Matthew 6, we're here in 1 Timothy, we'll come back, but notice in Matthew 6,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.959
if you will, and these that were given as Jesus is giving this exhortation here, we

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.959
find that He's saying, when thou prayest, He's speaking to His people, to us this morning.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:31.519
Notice in verse number 5 of Matthew 6, the Bible says this, and when thou prayest, thou

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:38.040
shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160
in the corners of the streets.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Notice what it says, that they may be seen of men.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.079
What was their motive?

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:49.920
They wanted somebody to say, did you hear that guy pray?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.320
I mean, did you hear how eloquent he was?

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
I mean, he's a great orator, I mean, he just, man, he waxed eloquent.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:06.799
They wanted to be seen of men, and Jesus says, verily I say unto you, they have their reward.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.600
You know what their reward is?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.679
The applause of man, the recognition of man, the ones that are standing and saying, did

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.679
you hear him?

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:14.679
Yeah, that's their reward.

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:15.679
That's it.

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.739
That's not what we're looking for, that's not effectual prayer.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:24.880
Notice in verse number 6, but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, when thou

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.079
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.480
secret shall reward thee openly.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.679
He says, but when you pray, verse 7, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.480
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.279
Be not therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.519
before ye ask him.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:50.640
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.799
Listen, when we think about effectual prayer and we look at this portion of Scripture in

00:05:54.799 --> 00:06:00.359
1 Timothy 2.8, I believe that God gives us some indications here, some prerequisites

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.839
with regard to effectual prayer.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.000
When we talk about prayer, we've spent several weeks now, we're going to, as we look at the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.559
subject matter of prayer, we agree that it's important, it's vital, it should be a part

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.399
of each of our lives, we ought to have structure in our prayer lives, we ought to be committed

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:19.679
to a time of prayer, having a place, and so on and so forth, and we understand the importance,

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.839
we agree this morning, but when we want to have effectual prayer, I mean prayer that

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:30.160
is effective, understand with me this morning that prayer, God has chosen that prayer moves

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.519
the hand of God.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:40.359
It's amazing to me that God has chosen, ordained it to be so, that prayer moves the hand of

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.359
God.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:46.920
God said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.519
things which thou knowest not.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:54.320
We find that he says, ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened, and we begin

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.880
to understand these wonderful promises of prayer, but understand with me this morning

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.760
that God has given us some prerequisites in this verse of Scripture with regard to

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.239
how we can have effectual prayer.

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:09.040
There's a lot of praying that goes on.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.279
You ever heard somebody, a lost person says, would you pray for me?

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.679
They don't understand prayer the same way we understand prayer.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.519
Would you agree with that statement?

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.279
They don't understand prayer the same way that we understand prayer, and I'm thankful

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:24.859
this morning that when we pray, we're entering into the presence of God Almighty who has

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:30.339
all power, who's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, but how is

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:34.940
it as we study the Scriptures, what is it that is needed in your life and my life that

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.579
we might have effectual prayer?

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:42.380
On 1 Timothy 2.8, back in our text of Scripture, the Bible says, I will therefore that men

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.739
pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:51.459
If you're taking notes this morning, I want you to notice first of all the importance

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:55.540
of being clean, the importance of being clean.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.739
The Bible says holy hands.

00:07:56.739 --> 00:08:02.859
I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands.

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:07.480
The idea of this phrase holy hands is undefiled by sin, free from wickedness.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.859
The idea is pure.

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:11.380
Now understand with me, God knows our frame.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.260
He knows that we are but dust.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.899
He understands our frame, but this morning as we look at this subject of effectual prayer,

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:23.179
being effective in our prayer lives, we understand that He says that I will therefore that men

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:26.899
pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:30.579
We're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection, but let me say this, if there's

00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:35.820
no sin in your life, if there's no sin in my life, it better be confessed.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.299
Because when we approach a holy God, we approach Him in the manner in which He tells us to

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:43.859
approach Him, and if we want our prayer life to be effective, we are going to have to be

00:08:43.859 --> 00:08:44.859
clean.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:51.940
Psalm 51 is a great passage of Scripture that deals with the psalm of repentance of David.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.059
We find that in that text of Scripture, he talks about the desire to be clean, and I've

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:01.059
mentioned this before, it's not a desire to be cleaner, it's a desire to be clean.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:04.580
And we understand this morning the importance of cleanliness.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.340
We understand this morning if you were going to have some breakfast before you came to

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.619
church, if you're going to drink a cup of coffee or some other beverage before you came

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:17.539
to church this morning, you wanted a clean cup, a clean plate, a clean fork, a clean

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:18.539
spoon.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:22.900
You didn't want to go and grab a plate that had some crusty stuff all over it, and someone

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.940
just takes a little towel and wipes it off and says, there you go.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.460
You say, that might be cleaner than it was, but it's not clean.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.080
Amen?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.140
This morning we find that He says that we're to lift up holy hands.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.619
We'll never be perfect.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.780
However, we understand this morning that our God is ready to forgive.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.219
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:48.340
We have the promise that when we sin and when we confess that sin, that God says that He

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.219
will cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:54.179
What a blessing.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.500
See, prayer is hindered by sin.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.940
And so therefore, if I want my prayer to be effective.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.300
If I understand this passage of Scripture dealing with effectual prayer and understanding

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:13.620
the prerequisites, we find first and foremost he says that we are to be clean, holy hands.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.660
The effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.100
I believe that there's truth as we look at that passage of Scripture, that verse of Scripture

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.100
in James 5 and verse 16 where the Bible would speak of positional righteousness.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.900
And I'm thankful that I have been declared righteous.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.820
If you're saved this morning, you've been declared righteous.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.660
In fact, the Bible would teach us that the righteousness of Christ has been imputed upon

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.200
our accounts.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.620
For God hath made him, Jesus, to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.920
the righteousness of God in him.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.140
And I'm thankful for the truth of positional righteousness.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.720
But what I tell you this morning is that God is concerned about practical righteousness,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.860
that we live right, that we live holy lives, clean lives, pure lives.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.080
And again, I understand that we'll never be perfect, but when we understand this morning

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.819
this truth of effectual prayer, the importance of being clean is given to us in this verse

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:15.500
of Scripture.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.940
Notice a few verses with me in the book of James.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.980
Look at James chapter 1 if you will.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.980
We've referenced James 5, 16 a couple of times, but look if you will at James chapter

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.980
1.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.300
And I want you to notice what God tells us in verse number 27.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.500
James 1 and verse number 27.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:39.900
The Bible says this, pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:46.420
the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, notice, and to keep himself unspotted from

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.459
the world.

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:52.100
Have you found that this world is against you?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.860
Have you found that it's easy to get dirty in this world?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.779
So if we're going to keep ourselves unspotted from the world, that's going to require some

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:02.779
action on our part.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.020
It's going to require some diligence.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.180
It's going to require some purpose in our lives that we're going to be unspotted from

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.180
the world.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.180
Why?

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.180
Because we live in this world.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.619
We're in the world, but thank God we're not of the world.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:22.020
Listen, what's happening in our society today, this huge issue with quote-unquote Christendom

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.100
in America today, is that there's been this real blur and this real blending and there's

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.460
not this distinction that God desires for there to be.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.260
I mentioned this on Wednesday evening in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 16, rejoice evermore.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.660
And I said this is different and we're to live different.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660
Why?

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.660
Because we are different.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.740
And he says that we're to be unspotted from the world.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.260
Notice with me in 1 Peter chapter 1.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.779
We see this truth in James 1.

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.619
Look in 1 Peter 1.

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:56.419
We find that God gives us this important truth with regard to understanding the fact that

00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:57.680
we're to be clean.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.540
He says in 1 Peter 1 beginning in verse 13, wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.300
be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.300
of Jesus Christ.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.180
Now notice these next verses.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:18.820
In verse 14, as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:26.500
your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.139
conversation.

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:31.900
Because it is written, be holy for I am holy.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.460
You know it's interesting during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, Jesus enters

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.380
into the temple and he turns over the tables, you remember?

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.740
You know he does that at the beginning of his earthly ministry and does it again at

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.460
the end of his earthly ministry.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.779
And what does that reveal to us?

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:46.699
Well, if we're not careful, things are going to creep in.

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:55.380
And we find here that as we look at this principle and this truth, if I want my prayer life to

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.580
be effectual, to be effective, then I must understand the importance of being clean.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.460
Of being clean.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.979
It's easy for things to get dirty.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:10.260
I remember my mother-in-law, before she was my mother-in-law, when I would go over to

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.419
the house where Holly was living when we were dating, she had this little thing on her refrigerator

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:17.700
and it said, I cleaned my house yesterday, I wish you could have seen it.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.700
And I remember the first time I saw that, I thought it was kind of comical.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.420
And the reality is that what happens, you can clean your house today, you can clean

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.260
it tomorrow, and you can find out that a week from tomorrow it's going to need to be cleaned

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.260
again.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Right?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.260
It's just what happens.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.260
It's just a cycle.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.940
Listen, if we're not proactive, if we're not purposed on this idea of having a clean life,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.260
we're going to be spotted from this world.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.339
We're going to be defiled.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:48.779
We're going to have things that are going to cause us to be dirty.

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:52.880
And we find this morning that we're to be clean, we're to live holy, we're to be holy

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.739
in all manner of conversation.

00:14:54.739 --> 00:14:59.820
In 1 John 3 and verse 22, God gives us this wonderful truth with regard to having our

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.700
prayers answered and to understanding that He answers prayer.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.920
And notice what 1 John 3 and verse 22 says, and whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:17.299
But notice this, it says, because we keep His commandments and do those things that

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:20.860
are pleasing in His sight.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.779
I've written in the margin of my Bible, are we?

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:25.779
Are we what?

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:26.779
Are we keeping His commandments?

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:29.580
Are we doing those things that are pleasing in His sight?

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.940
Have you ever heard anyone say, my prayers aren't being answered?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.500
Well, if that's the case in our lives, we ought to do some examination.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.380
Why aren't my prayers being answered?

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.119
Are my prayers not in accordance with God's will?

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:47.339
Maybe my prayers aren't being answered because sin is hindering my prayer life.

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:52.980
And we begin to examine those things and we find that this truth, I will therefore that

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.739
men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands.

00:15:56.739 --> 00:15:58.980
The importance of being clean.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.980
Sin will hinder prayer.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.899
Psalm 66 and verse 18 is a verse that's familiar to many of us.

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:04.899
We won't turn there.

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.260
We're going to turn to the book of Isaiah.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.980
But in Psalm 66, 18, the Bible says this, if I regard iniquity in my heart, notice this

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.059
phrase, the Lord will not hear me.

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:16.820
It's not a matter that He cannot hear you, it's that He will not hear you because you

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.179
have iniquity in your heart.

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:21.260
Listen, I'm thankful that God says He'll forgive.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.100
But he that covereth his sin shall not prosper.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.179
That's what the Bible says.

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:32.100
And we find that we can confess and we can forsake and that person finds grace and finds

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.500
mercy and has forgiveness and what a blessing that is.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.380
But this morning, God is interested in His people being holy.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.540
God has given some prerequisites.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.779
He says when we enter into His presence, listen, if you have sin in your life, if there's some

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:49.459
sin in your life, you can go to God and you can get that cleansed.

00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:54.779
You can be clean of that so that you can have effectual prayer.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:57.540
First in the book of Isaiah, if you will, we're going to look at chapter one and then

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.540
we're going to look at chapter 59 of the book of Isaiah.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.899
There's 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah and I wish we could look at more verses throughout

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:09.779
the book of Isaiah because so often this thought or this theme is recurring throughout the

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.779
book.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:13.779
But I want to look in chapter one and then I want to look at chapter 59 and I want you

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:18.420
to notice a couple of things with regard to the importance of being clean when it comes

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.420
to this subject matter of effectual prayer.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.940
Holy hands, undefiled by sin, free from wickedness, pure.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.500
Notice in Isaiah one, in verse 15, the Bible says this, and when you spread forth your

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.140
hands, I will hide mine eyes from you.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:44.660
Yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear why your hands are full of blood.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.360
Notice when he says in verse 16, wash you, make you, what does it say, clean.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.480
Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.519
Cease to do evil, learn to do well.

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:05.119
Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:09.880
Come now, God says, let us reason together, saith the Lord.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.480
Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be, what, white as snow.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.880
Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.839
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:28.080
But if you refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the Lord

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.640
hath spoken it.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.559
We look in this passage of scripture and we see that God says, you're going to pray in

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.799
verse number 15, but I'm not going to hear you.

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.799
Why?

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.799
Because of sin.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:42.280
Because your hands are full of blood.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.179
Because you're doing evil.

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:46.419
And he says, put away the evil.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.900
He says, learn to do well.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:54.679
He says, come, let us reason together, I offer forgiveness.

00:18:54.679 --> 00:19:00.299
He says there in verse number 18, though you, notice, your sins be as scarlet, they shall

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:04.659
be as white as snow.

00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:09.760
He says you're dirty, you're defiled, you're full of sin, but you need to be clean.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:17.200
Notice in chapter 59 of the book of Isaiah, in Isaiah 59, notice what the Bible says here

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.500
in verses 1 through 3.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:27.940
Verse 1 is a great promise, but it doesn't end with a period.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.140
It's interesting.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:37.179
In verse number 1 it says, behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save.

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:40.099
Neither is ear heavy that it cannot hear.

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:44.220
Aren't you thankful for those two truths in verse number 1?

00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:47.479
Do you see that it doesn't end with a period?

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:55.760
Notice in verse 2, but your iniquities, what is that, your sin, have separated between

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.960
you and your God and your sins have hid His face.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:07.200
from you, that he will not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:16.000
with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness."

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.320
Notice the great promise. I mean, it's an unclaimed promise because God says in verse

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.180
number one, his hand is not short that it cannot save, neither is his ear heavy that

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:31.420
it cannot hear, but he's not going to hear. Why? Because you have sin, you're not clean.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.760
So what do we do? Well, knowing that we have a God who's ready to pardon, a God who's ready

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.540
to forgive, we run to God for forgiveness. We say, as David said, wash me, cleanse me.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:47.040
I mean, clean me, help me to be right in your sight against thee, and the only. Have I sinned

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.940
and done this wickedness? And we get cleansed so that our prayers can be effectual, so that

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:59.760
we can have effective prayer. As we look at these prerequisites in 1 Timothy 2 and verse

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:07.480
number 8, the first that we see is the importance of being clean. What of this morning? As we

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.680
examine our lives, as we begin to look, and here in chapter number 59 of Isaiah, he talks

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.560
about the hands are defiled with blood, your fingers with iniquity, but then he talks about

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.560
your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. You know how many of

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:32.740
us get in trouble with our tongues? We say things, and then we act like it's no big deal.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:39.620
We need to understand the importance of being clean, being clean. Why isn't God answering

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:46.260
my prayer? God promised to answer prayer. I hope you've experienced prayer being answered

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.740
in your life, but if God's not answering your prayer, and I'm not saying that he's not answering

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.560
it just in the way that you want it to be answered. Understand sometimes God says no.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:02.320
Is that valid? Did he not say to Paul, my grace is sufficient for thee? Paul said remove

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.200
this, and God said my grace is sufficient for thee. But understand this morning that

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.040
when we enter into the presence of a holy God, he says that we're to come with holy

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:19.400
hands. We're to be clean. And I'm thankful this morning that it's not based upon your

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.040
merit or my merit that we're cleansed. It's based upon God's great mercy and his great

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:33.260
forgiveness. It's in his nature and character he says that he will pardon, he will forgive.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.160
What happens sometimes is there's so much pride in the life of an individual that they

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.380
refuse to acknowledge their sin, they refuse to go to the throne of grace and confess that

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:50.300
sin and find forgiveness, and therefore they live their lives with hindered prayer lives.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:56.100
When all along God says I'll forgive you, I'll forgive you. Now understand we're speaking

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.500
in this context this morning, we're not talking about being forgiven meaning going to heaven.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.940
We're talking about sin in a life of a believer that hinders our fellowship. I'm thankful

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:13.620
that we're, our relationship is constant. He's my father, I'm his child. What a blessing.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.540
But I want that fellowship to be sweet. I want to say as the songwriter said, I want

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.060
nothing between my soul and my savior. Neil Moody is famously known for saying that sin

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.340
will keep you from this book or this book will keep you from sin. But I would say to

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.140
you this morning that really when you have prayer, when you have sin in your life, not

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.700
only is your prayer hindered, but honestly you don't want to pray like you should pray

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:42.100
anyway because you have sin in your life. And you know it. You're not dealing with it.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:49.020
God says as he said to those in Isaiah 1, come let us reason together. If you be willing,

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.860
right? It's a decision that we make that we go to God and we say this is wrong, this is

00:23:53.860 --> 00:24:00.620
sin. I agree with you God. This is wicked. God forgive me. And we take the wonderful

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:06.580
promise that he said that he will. And he'll clean us, cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:13.620
So Paul says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands. Prerequisite

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.700
number one, we understand the importance of being clean. Number two, if you're taking

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.260
notes this morning, I would say this, the importance of being controlled by the Holy

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.620
Spirit. The importance of being controlled by the Holy Spirit. I'm thankful this morning

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.020
to be a New Testament believer. I'm thankful this morning that God let me be born when

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.540
I was born. He let me hear the gospel when I heard the gospel. Let me be saved when I

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.780
was saved. And what a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ and to have a completed

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.540
Bible this morning. And we find today that as we look at the scriptures, that as a New

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.380
Testament believer, we have this promise, we have this truth that the Holy Spirit of

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:53.660
God indwells every believer. I didn't understand it when I got saved, but I understand it since

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.860
I've been saved that at the very moment that I trusted Christ as my Savior, the Holy Spirit

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.300
of God indwelled me. I didn't understand all of that when I first got saved, but I

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.740
look at the scriptures and I read and I understand that God says at that moment I was indwelled

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.340
by the Holy Spirit of God. The Bible tells us that our bodies are the temple of the Holy

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.900
Spirit, which is in you, which you have of God. We're not our own. We're bought with

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.460
a price in 1 Corinthians 6, verses 19 and 20. We find the truth, the Bible tells us

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.700
in Ephesians chapter 1, that the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance. And what

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.540
a blessing to understand the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God, but we understand

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.500
that there's not only the indwelling, but there's the filling of the Holy Spirit of

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:43.380
God. You might be indwelled with the Spirit of God, but filled with self. You can be indwelled

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.860
with the Spirit of God and also filled with the Spirit of God. The Bible says in Ephesians

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:53.660
5, verse 18, that we're to be filled with the Spirit. By the way, this is a continual

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.060
thing. He says, be not drunk with wine or in excess, but be filled with the Spirit.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.060
This is continual. This is an everyday thing that, why? Because self wants to be the ruler

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:08.660
of your heart and mind. But we're to be filled with the Spirit of God. We're to, according

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.340
to Galatians 5, we're to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.580
flesh. When we look at this text of scripture and we find that the first prerequisite is

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.100
the importance of being clean, we look at this verse and he says, I will therefore that

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.820
men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath. Why do I say that we're to

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.220
be controlled with the Spirit of God, controlled by the Holy Spirit? Well, this idea of without

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:38.220
wrath means anger or violent passion. We understand from Galatians 5 the importance of walking

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.940
in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, but it's in Galatians 5

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:47.500
that we find that anger is a work of the flesh. We find this morning that as we begin to think

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.900
about anger, we understand that anger is a strong emotion. Anger often, if we're not

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.980
careful, will lead to sin in the life of an individual. We find that anger is this emotion

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.660
and we all have experienced times in our lives where we've been angry. I'm thankful that

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.260
God, though He turned over the tables like I mentioned a few moments ago, He did not

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.620
sin. And we're given the encouragement in God's Word, in Ephesians 4, we're going to

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:17.000
look at a couple of verses that we're to put off and put on. It's interesting to me that

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.200
in both of those passages of Scripture, God talks about the subject of anger. In Ephesians

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.160
4, turn there first if you will, and notice with me in Ephesians 4, the charge begins

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.960
in verse number 22 with regard to putting off some things and putting on some things

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.060
in verse 24, and then it begins to be illustrated in the verses to follow. We find that this

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.560
put off and put on principle is there for us and it's to put off the old man or the

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.680
old nature and to put on the new. Notice in Ephesians 4 in verse 22, the Bible says

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:56.880
that ye put off concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.920
the deceitful lust, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:10.200
new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. It starts in verse 25 talking

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.440
about lying. He says, wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth with his

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.280
neighbor, for we are members one of another. But then we find in verse 26 that he begins

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.320
to deal with this subject of anger. He says, be angry, notice what it says, in sin not.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:31.020
How many of you have found that's challenging? Because anger often will lead to sin. Be angry

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.920
in sin not. Sometimes we talk about, we use this phraseology, righteous indignation. Listen,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.679
here's some things that ought to make us angry, but we ought not sin. Amen? He says,

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:47.840
be angry in sin not. Notice what he says, let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.600
give place to the devil. Verse 28, he begins dealing with stealing, but we focus this morning

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.800
on verse 26 and 27 with regard to our context in 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 80 says, I

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.100
will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, the importance of being clean

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.820
without wrath, the importance of being controlled by the Spirit of God. Listen, if you're angry,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:15.660
it's going to hinder your prayer life. It's going to mess up how you pray if you're angry.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.460
If you're angry. And he says that we're to be angry in sin not, let not the sun go down

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:26.380
upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil. You know, the devil's just looking

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.420
for a little creak of the door open. That's all he's looking for. Somebody said it this

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.740
way, he's looking for a toehold so he can have a foothold so he can have a stronghold.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.619
Yeah. It said that the Sunday school teacher asked the class one day, what are you going

00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:45.380
to do if the devil comes knocking at your door? A little boy said, I'm going to let

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:54.780
Jesus answer it. I thought that's wonderful. Amen? Listen, anger is a problem for many

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.860
people. The Bible tells us in the book of Proverbs about angry people, angry men.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.920
And we find this morning here in Ephesians and then again in Colossians.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.980
Look over at Colossians 3 and notice what the Bible says there, we need to be controlled

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.540
with the Spirit of God.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.460
Anger is a work of the flesh.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.940
Can we be angry in sin?

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.100
Not yet, but I feel like a lot of people have a real hard time with that.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.740
Anger is an emotion that we deal with, but we better be filled with the Spirit of God.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.360
We better be controlled by the Holy Spirit.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.560
Notice in Colossians 3 and verse number 8, but now ye also put off all these.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:41.400
Do you see what's mentioned first, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.740
out of your mouth, lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:52.720
his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.640
him that created him.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.440
If we want to have effectual prayer, Paul gives in this verse of scripture in the inspirational

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.360
Holy Spirit of God, the importance of being clean.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.800
I believe that we see when he says without wrath, the importance of being controlled

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800
by the Spirit of God.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.280
You know it's vital in every area of my life and your life and the Christian life that

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.960
we're controlled by the Spirit of God.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.320
It requires that we surrender.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.720
It requires that we die to self.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.520
It requires that we take that position of I die daily, that we understand that I am

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.480
crucified with Christ.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.200
Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.640
And the life that I live in the flesh, I live how, by the faith of the Son of God who loved

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.280
me and gave himself for me.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.680
And we find this morning as we look at this truth of being controlled by the Holy Spirit,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:56.000
how that that would enable us to have effectual prayer without wrath, without wrath.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.280
This morning there's a lot of angry people in our world, a lot of angry people in our

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.280
churches.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.480
It's just true.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:10.800
People that are angry, that have wrath, it's going to hinder your prayer life, it's going

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.080
to hinder your prayer life.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.600
I was offended.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.400
You hear that often today, don't you?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.640
I was offended.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:30.280
Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.320
Somebody asked this question, I think it's pertinent to deal with, can you offend a dead

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320
person?

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.480
And obviously the answer is no.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.400
If I'm truly crucified with Christ, I can't be offended.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.520
But I tell you this morning, if you'd be honest and if I'd be honest and we'd evaluate our

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:54.200
lives, if I'm angry, it messes with my prayer life, it hinders my prayer life.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.760
If you're angry with someone, you're probably not praying for them as you should, right?

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:03.800
Or maybe you're praying some of those imprecatory prayers from the book of Psalms.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.360
And Jesus would say to you, you know not what spirit you're of.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:14.000
This morning we understand that as we look at this portion of Scripture, He says, I will

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.280
therefore that men pray everywhere, but He didn't put a period there.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.520
He said lifting up holy hands, being clean, without wrath, being controlled by the Spirit

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.800
of God.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.560
And number three this morning He says, end doubting.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.160
Number three this morning, the importance of praying with confidence, the importance

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.440
of praying with confidence.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.240
The idea of this word or this phrase without doubting when it says end doubting is really

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.200
this idea of a deliberation or deliberating over something, questioning what is true.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.000
It carries with it the idea of hesitation.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.560
Now you understand what doubt is.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.840
You understand that doubt, I've said this over the years, that if faith is a flower

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.280
then doubt is a weed.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280
And what do the weeds do?

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.500
Well the weeds try to choke out the flowers, right?

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.100
The weeds in the garden bed, they try to take whatever nutrients are there and they

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.940
take those and they choke out what you're trying to grow.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.460
If you had a garden, you're going to plan to have a garden this year.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:19.060
And it's amazing how that weeds seem to be able to grow everywhere.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.060
It's amazing to me.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.060
Listen, you've got to deal with the weeds.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.220
You say, I'm going to put that off, man, it's going to be a disaster, right?

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.300
Have you found it to be the case?

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.460
We give you all kinds of ideas of put this down and do this and so on and so forth.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.420
There's proactive need there.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.700
And so we understand doubting.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.940
He says, listen, God does not want us to be doubtful people.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.940
He wants us to have confidence in who He is and what He's able to do.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.240
He wants us to pray with confidence.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.660
He wants us as we go into the presence of God to know with confidence that He hears

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:51.660
us.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:58.800
He wants us to know with confidence that He's able to do what He only can do.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:04.140
And so this idea when He says that we're to come lifting up holy hands without wrath and

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:09.380
without doubting, we find this morning that we're to pray with confidence.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.380
Confident that God hears.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.380
Look at the book of Psalms.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.540
I want to read three verses of Scripture from the book of Psalms here.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.100
And just remind us this morning that we ought to be confident that God hears us.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.360
Psalm chapter three, we're going to start there and just look at three references this

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.460
morning in the book of Psalms that would help us to understand and to have that confidence

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.780
that God hears us.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.340
You ever talk to somebody and you ask them, did you hear me?

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.660
You ever have that situation?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.980
And then somebody says, yes, I did.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.980
And they said, what did I say?

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.220
Did you ever have that situation?

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.940
And then all of a sudden you find out whether they were really listening to you or not,

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.940
right?

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.540
And we find that God hears us.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.900
Notice in Psalm 3 and verse number 4, notice what the Bible says, I cried unto the Lord

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:59.060
with my voice and He heard me out of His holy hill, Sila.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.060
Just spend a moment and let that sink in.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.260
That I lifted my voice, I cried unto the Lord and He heard me.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.260
And He heard me.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:16.460
If you ever desired to reach someone, picked up the phone to call them, maybe it was an

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:22.740
urgent situation and you got a voicemail, ever happen?

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:28.100
And you didn't leave a message, you hang up and you call again, why?

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.100
Because it's urgent.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.620
You want to talk to them, you want to reach them and you get a voicemail, it can be frustrating.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:40.460
You understand this morning that God is never busy, God hears us.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.020
I know that we mentioned just a few moments ago where He says, I will not hear, well,

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.940
that's because of that sin, that iniquity.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.700
But if we've gone through the process of having holy hands, being clean, then we have this

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.500
confidence this morning that God hears us, that God hears us.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.060
He's never too busy for you.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.540
I think about Elijah when he's there at Mount Carmel.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:13.980
I mean, those false worshippers of Baal, they cried out, they cut themselves, they

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.420
did all kinds of things to try to get their false God to answer by fire and nothing happened.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:27.100
But you know, Elijah, after he repaired the altar and gave some instruction, he prayed

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:33.340
a powerful prayer and he said that he prayed it according to God's instruction and that

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.180
he prayed it so that the people would know that God is the God of heaven.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.500
And you know what happened after he prayed just a short prayer?

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.380
Fire came from heaven.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.700
God hears us.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:50.020
The psalmist, if you read Psalm 3 and you understand the context of Psalm 3, David,

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.180
we believe is the human penman, I mean, he's in a mess, he's in a lot of trouble.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:00.620
I mean, he's dealing with great adversity, but he says, I called, I cried unto the Lord

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.900
with my voice and he heard me.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.340
He heard me out of his holy hill, Siloam.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:12.020
Notice in Psalm 116, if you will, and we could again look at so many psalms this morning

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:18.140
of giving the truth where God says, I've heard them, I hear you, I've heard your prayer.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.620
And we look in Psalm 116, notice what the scriptures say.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.340
So often we mention 1 John when the Bible says, I love him because he first loved me.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.380
But notice what the psalmist says here in Psalm 116, I love the Lord, why?

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:37.100
Because he hath heard my voice and my supplications, because he hath inclined his ear unto me,

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.100
therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.300
Wow, what a great testimony.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.560
The psalmist says, I have confidence that God hears me.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.820
He hears my voice, he hears me when I pray.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:59.340
And therefore, because I have this confidence, I'm going to call upon him as long as I live.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.340
That ought to be our approach.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.140
That ought to be our perspective.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.820
You know, in the previous text of scripture in Psalm 115, the Bible speaks about those

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:13.740
false idols in verse number six and says, they have ears, but they hear not.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.260
Do you see it there in Psalm 115 and verse six?

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.660
They have ears, but they hear not.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.820
But then in Psalm 116, the psalmist says, I love him, why?

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:27.520
I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications, because he hath inclined

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.880
his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:41.280
Look in Psalm 120, if you will.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.080
Psalm 120 and verse number one, notice what the psalmist says.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.640
In my distress, have you ever been there?

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.440
I mean, if you've never had distress, talk to me after the service.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.920
Anyone who is born a woman in a few days and full of troubles, we have distress in

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.760
our lives.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.080
But notice, the psalmist says, in my distress, what did I do?

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:12.960
I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.460
God wants us to pray with confidence.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:21.740
He says without wrath, but He says without doubting, no hesitation, no deliberating,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.240
no questioning what is true, no.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.640
I enter into the presence of God, Paul says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.700
lifting up holy hands, without wrath, without doubting, knowing, having confidence that

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.160
God hears.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.840
Listen this morning, if you have confidence that God hears you, it will cause you to pray

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.680
more.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.720
The very practical, basic truth.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.480
And this morning, God has given us example after example, in verse after verse, and promise

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.360
after promise that says, I'll hear you.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.720
It ought to encourage us to pray.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.160
We pray with confidence.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.680
Notice not only that we're confident that God hears, but we're confident that God is

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.440
able.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.440
That God is able.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:14.480
You ever pray for something that, I mentioned this, I think, at some point last year.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:20.720
How many prayers on your prayer list right now, this week, are you praying that only

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.200
God can handle?

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.540
I'm not talking about praying things that you can manufacture in your own life.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.140
I'm not talking about manufacturing and working in circumstances and all this.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.140
No, no, no.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.740
I'm talking about praying that only God can answer.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:45.620
Praying specifically, seeing how God can do what only God can do.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.620
We referenced already Jeremiah 33, 3, when God says to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.300
answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.980
We're familiar with Ephesians 3 and verse number 20, now unto him which is able to exceeding

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.660
abundantly above all that we ask or think, unto him be glory.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.660
Why?

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.660
Because it's due unto his name.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:10.480
Listen, God wants to answer in such a way that only he can receive the glory.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.500
It's not going to be that someone's going to stand around and say, well, you kind of

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.500
did that.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.500
You manufactured that.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:21.260
You schemed and you devised and you, no, no, we need to be praying where only God is going

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:27.000
to get the acknowledgment, where it's obvious that God has done it.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.420
We find this morning that there are many examples throughout the scriptures where we read of

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.220
that type of work being done and we find this morning that it ought to be our desire, ought

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:43.160
to be our goal that we see God work and God glorified.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.200
God delights in answering prayer.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.620
God delights in showing himself mighty and powerful.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:54.900
He delights in working in such a way that only he receives the glory.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.660
So I wonder this morning if we're confident that God hears and we're confident that God

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:03.580
is able, what about your prayer life or what about my prayer life reveals that we're praying

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.860
to an omnipotent God?

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.980
In 1 John chapter 5, notice what we referenced this verse last week or two weeks ago.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:17.060
Notice what the Bible says in 1 John 5 and verse number 14.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:25.020
In 1 John 5 and verse number 14, we're speaking about the importance of praying with confidence

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.800
this morning.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:34.960
He says in 1 John 5, 14, and this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.460
according to his will, he heareth us.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.020
It was in fact last week that we mentioned this verse of Scripture because we talked

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.740
about in the very midst of an exhortation on prayer that God reveals to us his will

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.660
for humanity.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.020
Why is it that he reveals to us his will for humanity?

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.700
Because we're to pray according to his will.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.700
How do we know God's will?

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.740
You better get in the Bible.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.180
God reveals his will to us in his word.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.820
And as we study the Scriptures and we know that we're praying according to the will of

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.980
God, then we can have that confidence that he hears us.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:17.300
And we can have that expectancy, anxiously awaiting for God to answer and God to do what

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.300
only he can do.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.820
The psalmist says in Psalm 119, it's time, Lord, for thee to work.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:29.420
Listen, we're living in a time, if the psalmist said it then in Psalm 119 how true it is today,

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.340
it's time for God to work.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.780
It's time for God to work.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:33.780
Amen?

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.340
We need to pray that God would do what only God can do.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.620
This morning, you want your prayer life to be effective?

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:48.580
Listen, I'm not interested in religious exercise, mundane, monotonous, just going through the

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:56.020
motions, repeat after me, blah, blah, blah, blah, no, no, I'm not interested in all that.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.180
It's vain.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.540
I'm communing with my Father, I'm entering into his presence.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.420
When you pray, you're entering into the presence of a thrice holy God.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:09.900
And he says, you want your prayers to be answered?

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.980
Understand the importance of being clean.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.940
There's no insin in your life, deal with it.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.180
God says he'll forgive you, he's gracious, he's merciful.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.700
When God puts his finger on that thing, deal with it.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.340
Say as the psalmist said, search me, oh God, show me if there's any wickedness, any wicked

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.660
thing, so I can be clean.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:36.180
The importance of being in control of the Spirit of God, the importance of having confidence.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.300
I believe that if we understand these three prerequisites, if you will, in 1 Timothy 2.8,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:47.540
it will help each of us to have effectual or effective prayer.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.460
He said of those religious leaders, they have their reward.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.860
That's not the kind of prayer we're looking for.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:59.300
We're looking for the kind of prayer that our God who sees and hears in secret, answers

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.740
openly, and he shows what he's able to do.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:09.540
This morning, as we evaluate our prayer lives, how effective, effectual is our prayer life?

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.540
Is there something that's hindering our prayer life?

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.020
How do we get that taken care of?

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.540
We come to a gracious, merciful God, say God, would you forgive me, help me to be clean,

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.540
help me to have an effective, effectual prayer life.

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.540
Let's pray this morning.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.100
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.100
I thank you for the instruction that you give us in your Word, and God, not only have

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:38.900
you instructed us to pray, but I believe you've revealed to us in your Word how we can have

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.700
effectual prayer.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:47.020
You said that the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much, and we want

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.740
to be praying in that manner.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.740
We find in this single verse of Scripture, these three prerequisites, and God, I pray

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.540
that you'd help each of us, Lord, to be clean, help us to be controlled by thy Spirit, Lord,

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.540
help us not to be walking in the flesh, help us not to be carnal, help us to be spiritual,

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.540
controlled by the Holy Spirit.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.500
Help us, Lord, to pray in confidence, believing that you're able.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.500
We thank you that you are the Lord God omnipotent, that you rule and that you reign.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.940
I pray that not one person will leave here this morning with any doubt that you hear

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:26.060
prayer, that you answer prayer, that you're able to do exceeding abundantly above all

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.140
that we ask or think.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.260
Help us to pray in according to your will.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.020
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives that only you can.

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.620
Well thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name I pray, would you

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.620
stand with me?

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.220
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.460
I hope this morning you agree with me, I don't want to just go through a religious exercise

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.860
of quote-unquote,
