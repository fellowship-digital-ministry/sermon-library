1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
cut out one of our songs,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,440
and I'm going to shave down my messages, amen.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,439
And so I think prayer is certainly essential,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,359
and we want to have a greater focus and priority

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,520
on prayer in our services,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,639
and so we are making some adjustments with regard to that.

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:23,200
1 Corinthians chapter number 10 this evening,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,479
and we've been studying for the last

9
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,600
several Wednesday evenings.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,860
In fact, it's been a month and a half now

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,000
that we've had this miniseries, if you will, Teach Me,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we noted the continued plea of the psalmist

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,520
throughout the book of Psalms

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,880
when he would cry out, teach me,

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,340
and we encouraged ourselves,

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,979
and we were challenged that we too

17
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,779
would adopt that perspective,

18
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,619
that we would make that same plea,

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,659
and that plea represents for us a desire to learn,

20
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,380
and how we need to learn the truth that God has for us.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,340
We spoke about the importance of having a teachable spirit.

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,099
We spoke about the purpose, or two purposes, for learning,

23
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,779
and we looked at some things with regard

24
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:13,620
to how we can really effectively in our own lives,

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,260
how we can increase learning

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,459
or promote learning in our lives.

27
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,139
This evening, we're gonna start looking

28
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:23,360
at some various ways in which the Lord will teach us,

29
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,000
and we'll look at a number of things

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,319
over the next few weeks, just different classrooms

31
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,839
or different ways in which he would instruct us.

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,300
This evening, if you're taking notes,

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,599
I would say it's, I've just titled the message

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,199
Lessons from History, Lessons from History.

35
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,879
Notice with me in 1 Corinthians 10, in verse number six,

36
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,739
I'm kinda jumping right in the middle here.

37
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,319
We'll look at the center section

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,279
of this first several opening verses

39
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:48,040
in 1 Corinthians 10 for our message this evening,

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,959
but notice what Paul says to the believers in Corinth here,

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,239
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

42
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,160
in verse number six, now these things,

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,720
notice what he says, these things were our examples

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,959
to the intent we should not lust after evil things

45
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,160
as they also lusted.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,119
He's gonna give us some examples,

47
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,259
four examples in the next several verses,

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,720
and notice what he says in verse number 11.

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,960
Now all these things happened unto them for in samples,

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,679
and notice this, they are written for our admonition

51
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,360
upon whom the ends of the world are come.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,800
It was Winston Churchill who accurately wrote,

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,880
those that fail to learn from history

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
are doomed to repeat it, and what a great statement that is.

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,479
Of course, it's been often repeated over the years.

56
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,119
In fact, if you do some digging,

57
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,800
you'll find that it's actually ascribed

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,199
to a couple of other folks as well

59
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,320
that have taken credit for coming up with that statement,

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,520
but I think for most of us, most famously known

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
is that it's Winston Churchill who wrote that,

62
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,039
and the reality is that throughout the scriptures,

63
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,880
God has graciously recorded for us historical accounts.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,199
We understand the word of God contains prophecy.

65
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,940
Some of that prophecy has already come to pass.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,399
Some of that prophecy is still to take place,

67
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:15,399
and we find that much of God's word is history.

68
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,399
In fact, as you study the Old Testament

69
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,020
and you divide up some of the books,

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,279
there's a section that we often refer to as the Pentateuch,

71
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,000
and then the historical books and the poetical books

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,639
and the minor prophets, the major prophets,

73
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,720
and so on and so forth, and so we're understanding

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,160
the truth of history, and the reality is that

75
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,520
as God has provided us with these historical accounts,

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,759
I believe tonight that one of the purposes

77
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,759
in recording these events for us

78
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,399
is so that we might learn lessons,

79
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,699
so that we can learn lessons from the word of God.

80
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,119
Stay here in 1 Corinthians, but I wanna reference a verse

81
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,399
over the book of Ephesians.

82
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,440
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will,

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,360
in the fifth chapter, and I want you to see

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,639
what the Bible tells us.

85
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,479
What a great instruction that is given

86
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,720
here in Ephesians 5 and verse number 10.

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,720
The Bible says, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,160
Now, it's a simple verse of scripture, just a few words,

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,320
but the depth of the instruction,

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,220
the challenge that is given to us

91
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,619
in this one single verse of scripture,

92
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,739
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

93
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,200
What is it that God, in my life, in your life,

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,799
of our behavior, what's acceptable and what's unacceptable?

95
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,760
No doubt, we have experience in the workplace,

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
we've experienced in the home,

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,399
we've experienced as we've raised children.

98
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,440
We've said something like,

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,799
listen, that's unacceptable behavior.

100
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:50,559
It is not acceptable for you to behave in that manner.

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,220
We've said that, we've heard that,

102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,399
we maybe were told that when we were children,

103
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,119
and whatever we were doing was unacceptable.

104
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:01,839
It was not appropriate, and so we find there in Ephesians

105
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,579
that we are told that we are to prove

106
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,839
what is acceptable unto the Lord.

107
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,359
I believe one way that really helps us

108
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,399
to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord

109
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,440
is by studying the historical accounts

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,119
that God gives us in his word.

111
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,559
In this very account that we're going to look at

112
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,600
this evening from 1 Corinthians 10,

113
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,279
we find that the apostle Paul is going to use history

114
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,160
to teach the believers in the church in Corinth.

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,940
He's going to reference four different periods of time

116
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,980
in Israel's history in order to teach them some lessons.

117
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,380
Now, I want you to see what he says,

118
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,980
how he prefaces the statements that he's going to make

119
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,540
or the historical accounts that he's going to reference.

120
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,980
I read verse six and 11, but draw your attention

121
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,779
to verse number five in 1 Corinthians 10.

122
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,859
Notice what the word of God says.

123
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:53,859
But with many of them, God was not well-pleased,

124
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:58,859
for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

125
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,899
Now, these things were our examples to the intent

126
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:10,739
we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.

127
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,940
We find that he says in verse number 11

128
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,540
that these things that happened unto them

129
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,079
were for examples that they are written for our admonition

130
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,100
upon whom the ends of the world are come.

131
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,859
I believe that the believers in Corinth

132
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,299
were that Paul's intent, the Holy Spirit of God

133
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,019
leading him to write these words, to give them these words,

134
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,019
were so that those believers in Corinth

135
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,859
would learn from these historical accounts.

136
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,899
In like fashion this evening,

137
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,720
as the word of God has been preserved for us,

138
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,820
God desires that we too would learn

139
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,660
from the account that is provided to us.

140
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,820
And we find that in these four examples,

141
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,559
really, if you're taking notes,

142
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,959
it would be behavior to be avoided.

143
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,519
Behavior to be avoided.

144
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,679
When the word of God says,

145
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:59,239
but with many of them, God was not well-pleased,

146
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:03,260
immediately my mind wants to draw attention

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,519
to what was the behavior

148
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,880
that resulted in God not being pleased.

149
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Why?

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,359
Because I wanna make note of that behavior

151
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,920
and ensure that I do not implement that behavior in my life.

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
Does that make sense?

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,600
I was the oldest.

154
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I only have a younger brother.

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,239
Some of you are not the firstborn.

156
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:26,720
You're maybe the youngest, maybe somewhere in between.

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,679
But as a older sibling,

158
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,040
there were times, no doubt,

159
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,359
that my brother could learn from my example.

160
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,200
There were times,

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
he's only a couple of years younger than I am,

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,880
so I could learn from his example.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,459
And there were times in which you observed someone

164
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,859
that did something that was not pleasing,

165
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:47,059
a sibling, and using that analogy,

166
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,980
that example this evening,

167
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,339
that was not pleasing.

168
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,339
I said, okay, well, I don't wanna do that.

169
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,320
It's not something I wanna do.

170
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,459
I don't wanna follow in those tracks.

171
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,739
And so look at the four examples that are given here,

172
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,440
behavior to be avoided.

173
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,260
In verse number seven, the first one is given.

174
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,260
He says, neither be ye idolaters,

175
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,820
as were some of them.

176
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
As it is written,

177
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,500
that people sat down to eat and drink

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,339
and rose up to play.

179
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,459
I believe, as you look at verse number seven,

180
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,899
that it's the account in Exodus 32

181
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,459
that is being referenced.

182
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,899
Won't take the time to go there,

183
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,739
but that's the record in which God gives us

184
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:26,019
of the golden calf and all that takes place.

185
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,500
And God had been giving Moses the law.

186
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,619
And as Moses is receiving the law,

187
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,979
the people are in the camp breaking the very law

188
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,159
that God is providing.

189
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,299
In fact, at that time,

190
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,940
he's giving them instruction for the tabernacle.

191
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,700
And so they've made the covenant to obey the law.

192
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,859
And he's getting the instruction for the tabernacle,

193
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,859
and now they're breaking that.

194
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,099
But notice it says, neither be ye idolaters.

195
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,340
We know that the nation of Israel,

196
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,700
as you study the Old Testament,

197
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,260
idolatry is something that they continually deal with,

198
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,140
and it's a recurring sin.

199
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,340
It's preached against.

200
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,340
The prophets preach out against the wickedness

201
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,780
and the sin of idolatry.

202
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,820
But we find that the New Testament tells us,

203
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,020
in fact, in the book of 1 John,

204
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,099
that we're to keep ourselves from idols.

205
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:12,619
And though many of us in America,

206
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,559
in our homes, we would not have idols

207
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,820
that we would think of in our mind's eye as being an idol,

208
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,099
a wooden structure,

209
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,460
something that we'd put on a shelf somewhere

210
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,599
and pray to or bow down to.

211
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,820
And sometimes we think of idols,

212
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,719
we think of that in our mind,

213
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:31,619
but the reality as an idol is anything we put before God.

214
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,719
God desires, he deserves the preeminence, amen?

215
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,039
Colossians 1 says that in all things,

216
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,859
he, Christ, might have the preeminence.

217
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,119
It's interesting here that the example that is given

218
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,760
in verse number six, excuse me,

219
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,239
in verse number seven about idolatry,

220
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,679
it actually doesn't even mention the golden calf.

221
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,919
You notice that?

222
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,000
It says that the people sat down to eat and drink

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,159
and rose up to play.

224
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,520
And the reference of the calf isn't even given there.

225
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,640
As you study the scriptures,

226
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,479
you see that that's what they were doing.

227
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,159
And of course, the calf was an integral part of that,

228
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,080
but how important it is that we understand

229
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,719
the dangers of idolatry.

230
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,599
We skip, we move down to verse number eight

231
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,960
as we make progress here.

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,280
He now speaks of fornication.

233
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,719
He says, neither let us commit fornication

234
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:24,039
as some of them committed and fell in one day,

235
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,520
three and 20,000.

236
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
Wow.

237
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,080
That would be the record back in Numbers chapter 25.

238
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
And we don't take the time this evening

239
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
to look back at all of these references,

240
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,119
but again, they're lessons from history here,

241
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,840
behavior to be avoided.

242
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
And we find that he speaks about these

243
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
that were committing fornication.

244
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,640
And this is the context in which Balaam

245
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,119
in all of that situation,

246
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,280
and he could not curse the people of God

247
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,200
because they'd been blessed by God.

248
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
And so he said, here's what you do.

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,039
You corrupt the people of God.

250
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,840
And it was through fornication and how important it is

251
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
that we're mindful of the danger.

252
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,159
Now, it's interesting that he's writing this

253
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,159
to the church in Corinth.

254
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,359
If you know anything about the city of Corinth,

255
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,640
you understand that the city of Corinth

256
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,000
was a city that was given over to much immorality

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,159
and fornication was very prevalent.

258
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,359
In fact, they would use a phraseology

259
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,640
when they would speak about someone

260
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,559
that would commit the act of fornication

261
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,039
or be involved in the sin of fornication.

262
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,960
Corinthesiam was a word that they would use,

263
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,479
and it would be said of them

264
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,280
that they were acting and behaving as a Corinthian.

265
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,320
Now, that's not very positive

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,520
for your image of your city, of your people to be.

267
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,320
You see someone that's behaving and committing fornication.

268
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,840
You say, well, you're acting like a Corinthian.

269
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,080
And now he's writing to them,

270
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,239
and he's telling them, listen to the Old Testament.

271
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,239
There's a lesson.

272
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,840
23,000 people died in one day.

273
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
This is serious business.

274
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,159
Learn the lesson.

275
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,559
Notice verse number nine.

276
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,200
Neither let us tempt Christ,

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
as some of them also tempted

278
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,679
and were destroyed of serpents.

279
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,559
This is interesting.

280
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,520
I admit to you, as you read verse number nine

281
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,559
and you see that he says that they were tempting Christ,

282
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,280
the passage of Scripture that's being referenced

283
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,640
based upon the remainder of verse number nine,

284
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
that they were destroyed of serpents,

285
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
would be Numbers 21,

286
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,760
and we're familiar with the fiery serpents.

287
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,520
And if you read the text of Scripture in Numbers 21,

288
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,719
they're complaining,

289
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,400
they're murmuring against Moses and against God,

290
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,799
and they're saying that they hate

291
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,479
the manna that God had provided.

292
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,599
And so here, the Scriptures say that they're tempting Christ.

293
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,520
They're gonna deal with the subject of murmuring

294
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,320
in the next verse, but to tempt means to,

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,559
in this context of tempting Christ,

296
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,280
means to put to proof God's character and power.

297
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,799
In other words, what they were doing is they were taking,

298
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,159
and as they were tempting Christ in that situation,

299
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,239
they were challenging the very character and power of God.

300
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,679
God had provided for them graciously.

301
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,239
God had given them leadership.

302
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:09,320
God had given them a human leader in the man Moses.

303
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,960
God had provided them leadership with the pillar of fire

304
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
and the pillar of cloud,

305
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,039
and he had provided for them all that they needed.

306
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,320
He had provided water and he had provided manna.

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,080
And yet, as they're sitting there

308
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
and they're tempting Christ,

309
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,119
they're putting to proof God's character and power,

310
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,280
they're saying that God somehow was wrong

311
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
in what he was doing.

312
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,159
They said this in Numbers 21,

313
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,000
in that passage of Scripture that's being referenced,

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,479
they said this,

315
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,960
wherefore have you brought us out of Egypt

316
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,280
to die in the wilderness?

317
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Now, that was a recurring statement

318
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,640
of the children of Israel.

319
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,320
They would say that often,

320
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,599
and we find that he says,

321
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,559
listen, neither let us tempt Christ.

322
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,640
Verse number 10 gives us our fourth example

323
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,559
of behavior to be avoided

324
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,080
as we're learning these lessons from history.

325
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,320
It says in verse number 10,

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,080
neither murmur ye,

327
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,919
as some of them also murmured

328
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,239
and were destroyed of the destroyer.

329
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,960
To murmur is to complain.

330
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,919
I believe that it's number 16

331
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,320
that is being referenced here in verse number 10.

332
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,760
But the reality is that there's so many portions

333
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,719
of Scripture that you could go to

334
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,119
in looking at the nation of Israel

335
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,520
and see they're complaining.

336
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,799
They were a complaining people,

337
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,239
a murmuring people.

338
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,119
I mean, as soon as they were done singing

339
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,080
the great song of victory

340
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,000
after they had crossed over the Red Sea

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
and all of the victory that they experienced

342
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,039
in Exodus 14 and into Exodus 15,

343
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,640
by the time you get to the end of the chapter,

344
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,119
they're complaining.

345
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,840
They're murmuring.

346
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
And it was a constant thing for them.

347
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,159
Listen, it is so easy.

348
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,520
I know I've said this over the years.

349
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,280
It is so easy for us to complain.

350
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,599
It is so easy for us to murmur.

351
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:55,559
And it reveals that discontentment.

352
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,760
It really challenges the very character

353
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,919
and person of God when we're murmuring

354
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,119
and complaining and we're questioning

355
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,559
the goodness of God.

356
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,840
And we find that he lists these four examples

357
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,039
from history of behavior to be avoided,

358
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,280
idolatry, fornication,

359
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
neither let us tempt Christ,

360
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,000
stop murmuring, don't complain.

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,119
And he says, listen,

362
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,640
with many of them, God was not well pleased.

363
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,479
He says that they were,

364
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:25,559
they are our examples to the intent.

365
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,559
We should not lust after evil things

366
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,520
as they also lusted.

367
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,280
And when we see the behavior

368
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,159
and we see the consequence,

369
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,280
we ought to learn from history.

370
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,840
Remember, as I started this evening,

371
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,679
that very familiar quote,

372
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,440
that those that fail to learn from history

373
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
are doomed to repeat it.

374
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,479
And God has lessons for us.

375
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,280
He says that these are written,

376
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,960
they are written according to verse number 11,

377
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
for our admonition,

378
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
as a warning to us.

379
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
And what a blessing,

380
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,559
and I'm so thankful that God has been faithful.

381
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,440
So when we think about that responsibility

382
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,039
that we have as the people of God

383
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,080
to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord

384
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
in the sight of the Lord,

385
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,840
then I can look at some examples from history

386
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,640
and I can say, okay, here's some behavior

387
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,919
that is to be avoided.

388
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,280
We, of course, are reminded that Paul

389
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,719
would tell the believers in Rome,

390
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,359
as he's writing there in the book of Romans,

391
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,440
in chapter number 15,

392
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
you don't need to turn there,

393
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,919
but the things that were written aforetime

394
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,559
were written for our learning

395
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,679
in Romans 15 and verse number four.

396
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,359
So behavior to be avoided.

397
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,000
Let me give you some behavior that is appropriate.

398
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We don't see it here in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10,

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,359
but I want you to just turn quickly

400
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,640
over to Exodus chapter number 40.

401
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,239
And I wanna use this example this evening

402
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,159
from history of some appropriate behavior

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
in which God was pleased.

404
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,799
And again, I hope that it would be a lesson

405
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,400
that we'd learn from history

406
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
as we look at this passage of scripture.

407
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,599
I do not have the time to go through

408
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,400
all of the verses of Exodus chapter number 40,

409
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,640
so you'll have a little homework this evening.

410
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,640
And I trust it'll be an enjoyable exercise for you.

411
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,800
As you look at Exodus chapter number 40,

412
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,219
you're going to find in this passage of scripture

413
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,459
that all of the work of the tabernacle,

414
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,099
all of the pieces of furniture,

415
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,819
everything's been completed.

416
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,739
And it's here in Exodus chapter number 40

417
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,060
that the tabernacle was reared up.

418
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,900
And we find that the Bible uses some repetition here

419
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,020
that I think is helpful for us to identify.

420
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,900
And I'll give you what the phrases are.

421
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,660
Beginning in verse number three

422
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,219
and going down through verse number 15,

423
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:42,099
you'll see this phrase repeated 13 times.

424
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,540
And thou shalt.

425
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,099
And thou shalt.

426
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,939
What's God saying?

427
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,459
Here's the instruction.

428
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,140
Here's what you're supposed to do.

429
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,699
And thou shalt do this.

430
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,140
And thou shalt do that.

431
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,459
And he gives all of the instruction

432
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,140
and he uses 13 times.

433
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,540
And thou shalt.

434
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,180
It concludes in verse number 16,

435
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,400
thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him,

436
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,819
so did he.

437
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,599
But then I want you to notice another phrase

438
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,180
that is repeated seven times.

439
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:14,939
So 13 times from verse three down to verse number 15,

440
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:18,859
you see the repetition of the phrase and thou shalt,

441
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,020
seven times beginning in verse number 17

442
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,020
and concluding in verse number 29,

443
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,380
excuse me, verse 19 and down through verse number 29,

444
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,239
it says this, as the Lord commanded Moses.

445
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,339
If you read the entirety of each of the verses

446
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,219
where they end with that phraseology,

447
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,739
as the Lord commanded Moses,

448
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:40,140
what you'll find is and thou shalt

449
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,660
was met with as the Lord commanded.

450
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,420
There was obedience.

451
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,280
And we find that the obedience is noted

452
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,900
in these verses of scripture

453
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,260
that they did as the Lord commanded.

454
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,199
And it tells us this in verse number 33.

455
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,699
And he, speaking of Moses here,

456
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,619
he reared up the court round about the tabernacle

457
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,739
and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate.

458
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:11,260
Notice this phrase, so Moses finished the work.

459
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,819
As you look at all of these verses

460
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,619
and perhaps if you'd go back later

461
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:18,260
and just mark where those phrases are repeated

462
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,699
and see the obedience of Moses

463
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,819
and the people of God here in this passage of scripture,

464
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:27,660
I want you to note that there's a word

465
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,719
in verse number 34 that is so critical.

466
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:33,660
And it's the word that begins the verse, it's then.

467
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:38,859
Then, the Bible says in verse 34,

468
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,540
a cloud covered the tent of the congregation.

469
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,060
And notice this, the glory of the Lord

470
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,939
filled the tabernacle.

471
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,619
I believe that when the scriptures tell us

472
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:53,819
in verse number 34 that the glory of the Lord

473
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,760
filled the tabernacle, that that reveals to us

474
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,520
that God was pleased, amen?

475
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,020
We read in 1 Corinthians 10 that with many of them,

476
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,199
God was not well pleased.

477
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,380
We do not read here in verse number 34,

478
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,020
the Bible says in those words that God was pleased with them

479
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,060
but no doubt when his glory fills the tabernacle,

480
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,760
it reveals to us that God is pleased.

481
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,760
The then of verse number 34 is the sum result

482
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,420
of the verses that you read prior to the,

483
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,380
and thou shalt met with as the Lord commanded.

484
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,540
Then, the glory of the Lord filled the house.

485
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,540
And we find that there was an attitude of obedience,

486
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,920
an attitude of submission to the plan and will of God

487
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,819
and God blessed.

488
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,560
The reality this evening is that the word of God,

489
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,099
there's so much in God's word that's history.

490
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,939
And God teaches us lessons from history.

491
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:58,780
I'm not gonna take the time, we'd have Wednesday night

492
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,420
lessons from history from now until I don't know when,

493
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,140
we'd finish it, we'd just do it over and over and over.

494
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,140
But when we have this attitude of Lord teach me,

495
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,099
and we've understood the importance

496
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,579
of having a teachable spirit,

497
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,920
and we've understood some of the purposes of learning,

498
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,920
and we've tried to foster learning in our own lives

499
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,660
and to provide for a setting that would allow for learning

500
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,420
and we've done all of these things.

501
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,819
And now we understand that God teaches us lessons

502
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,020
from history.

503
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,459
So now all of a sudden, when I'm reading the word of God

504
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,660
and I'm reading these historical accounts,

505
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,719
it's not so that I can just know what happened historically.

506
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,900
It's not so that I can just list out the names

507
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,780
of the kings of Judah in order.

508
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,739
And by the way, if you can do that, the Lord bless you.

509
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,900
But you understand what I'm saying.

510
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,619
It's not that we're just looking at it

511
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,579
from the perspective of, okay,

512
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:59,579
I got the historical account that took place.

513
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,939
But what lesson is God teaching me from history?

514
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,619
Because the things that were written aforetime

515
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,260
were written for our learning.

516
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,099
And God recorded it, he's preserved it

517
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,739
so that we could learn from it.

518
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:19,500
And we see that in the approach of the Apostle Paul.

519
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,260
He says, listen, now we know some things

520
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,540
about the church in Corinth.

521
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,680
Not a great church.

522
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,500
The things that Paul deals with in those four examples

523
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,619
that we looked at in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10,

524
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,459
in fact, all of those were prevalent

525
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:35,020
in their church in Corinth.

526
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,859
And so what's Paul doing?

527
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,579
He's saying, let's go back to history

528
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,239
and let's learn from history.

529
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,500
And let's learn of behavior that did not please the Lord.

530
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,180
Because with many of them, God was not well pleased.

531
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,420
This evening, I hope that this short study

532
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,180
would really be a catalyst in your life and in my life

533
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,859
that when we read history in the word of God

534
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,780
and we're reading these historical accounts,

535
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,079
that we say, okay, God, what are you teaching me?

536
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,020
What can I learn besides just the ability

537
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,939
to rehearse what happened?

538
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:11,339
What lessons from this historical account

539
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,459
do you have for me that I can apply in my life

540
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,599
that I might walk with you in a more closer way

541
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,560
that my behavior would be pleasing in your sight?

542
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
Because if I'm gonna prove what is acceptable

543
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
unto the Lord, I'm gonna have to dig into the word of God.

544
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Proving, that word prove, it really is a term

545
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
that's used in metalworking and the purification of metals

546
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,739
in that process, it's a process.

547
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:40,400
And it's a lengthy process and it's a work

548
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,239
that has to be done.

549
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,560
And so God says, we need to prove what is acceptable

550
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,680
in the sight of the Lord.

551
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,119
We need to dig in and say, okay, God,

552
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,339
if you weren't pleased with them,

553
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:49,719
what was it specifically that they did

554
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,920
that caused you to not be pleased?

555
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,319
What was it specifically that they did

556
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,680
that made you pleased with their behavior?

557
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,880
You ever read about David trying to move the ark?

558
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,119
Uzzah died, right?

559
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,719
You remember?

560
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,760
Remember the passage?

561
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,160
We're not gonna take time to go there tonight,

562
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,839
but you know what happened after that?

563
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,920
David learned.

564
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
They left the ark, right?

565
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,040
And then he went back to find out

566
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,599
how are we supposed to move this thing?

567
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,439
Guess what?

568
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:27,839
God had already told them how they're supposed to move it.

569
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,920
You're not supposed to use a new cart.

570
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,800
You're supposed to use the staves that were made to move it.

571
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,640
And it's supposed to be done by the priest, right?

572
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,479
You're familiar with it?

573
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,319
And so guess what?

574
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,800
Then they came back and they moved it the proper way.

575
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,520
God's work has to be done God's way.

576
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,280
And there are lessons that you can learn

577
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,599
through all of these historical accounts.

578
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,800
And God says, I have some lessons for you from history.

579
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,640
Let's pray.

580
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,459
Father, we love you tonight.

581
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,199
We thank you for loving us.

582
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:58,400
Thank you for the opportunity that we have

583
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
to briefly study your word.

584
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,619
And God, we thank you for the privilege of prayer

585
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,959
that we can enter into your presence,

586
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:08,680
that we can bring our petitions before thy throne,

587
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,119
knowing that you're able to do exceeding,

588
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,040
abundantly above all that we ask or think,

589
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,119
knowing that we can receive the help that we need,

590
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,239
that we could be strengthened.

591
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:21,319
We do thank you that you are our helper,

592
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,520
that you're a very present help in the time of trouble.

593
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,560
And God, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer,

594
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,119
that you'd be exalted and magnified,

595
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,719
that we'd be drawn closer to thee,

596
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,280
that you'd work in and through our lives.

597
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,880
And we'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.

598
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,719
Amen.

599
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,839
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin tonight?

600
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,400
You came in and didn't get one?
