1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,599
And we're so thankful for the truth of the word of God.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,960
I'm so thankful that he went to that cruel cross.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,399
He was buried in that borrowed tomb

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,159
and he rose in victory,

5
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:15,039
conquering sin, death, and the grave, amen.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,920
And he is risen, hallelujah.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,360
And what a joy.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,440
And the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,079
is the cornerstone of our faith.

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,459
And I mentioned this morning during our outdoor service,

11
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,180
I read from the portion of scripture,

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,520
not only in the book of Matthew,

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,099
but also there in the book of 1 Corinthians

14
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,700
and looked at a portion of scripture

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,180
from 2 Timothy chapter number two.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,659
But there in 1 Corinthians chapter number 15,

17
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,259
of course, we understand that Paul tells us

18
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,180
that if Christ be not risen,

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,779
then our preaching is vain, our faith is vain,

20
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,700
we are yet in our sins,

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,139
but now is Christ risen from the dead, amen.

22
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,259
And what a blessing.

23
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,700
It is the cornerstone of our faith

24
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:01,819
and we are rejoicing today in the certain knowledge

25
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,779
that God has given us that he ever liveth

26
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,699
to make intercession for us.

27
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:11,220
Luke 24, I'll be looking at verses 36 through 53.

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,739
And let me just read verse number 36

29
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,900
and then we'll get into the message this morning.

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,379
The Bible says, and as they thus spake,

31
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:22,739
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,699
and saith unto them, peace be unto you.

33
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,459
As you can tell in the bulletin this morning,

34
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,379
I've titled the message, Jesus stood in the midst of them.

35
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,239
We'll be looking at Luke 24, verses 36 through 53.

36
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,739
But before we get there,

37
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,419
by way of introduction this morning,

38
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,419
I'd like to really kind of set the scene, if you will,

39
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:46,040
before we dive into our text this morning.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,459
We understand that it's in Luke chapter number 23

41
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,980
that God provides for us a record of the trial,

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,019
the crucifixion, and the burial

43
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,699
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

44
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,699
By the way, I'm thankful that he endured

45
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,739
such contradiction of sinners, amen,

46
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,339
for the joy that was set before him,

47
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,379
according to Hebrews chapter number 12.

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,360
And what a blessing to know that he took my place,

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,860
he took your place on that cruel cross,

50
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,940
and he paid for the sin of all mankind.

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,139
We find that it's in Luke chapter number 24

52
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,300
that as we begin reading this particular chapter

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,940
and the first few verses,

54
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,660
that God provides for us the record

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,179
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

56
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:30,179
The tomb, it could not hold him, amen.

57
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:33,940
And yes, he was buried there, yes, he died.

58
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,580
He was really dead.

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,500
He fully paid for the sin of mankind

60
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,740
and he went into that tomb.

61
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,820
But as the kids said, as we read earlier,

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
as we've been singing, the angel said,

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,020
he is not here, for he is risen.

64
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,779
As he said.

65
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,580
We find that it's there in Luke chapter number 24,

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,740
or in the beginning portion here,

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,259
that Jesus appears and we find the resurrection

68
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,539
and the angels giving information

69
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,380
to those that were at the tomb first.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,020
And you read in verse number six,

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,660
he is not here, but is risen.

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,500
And then notice this, remember how he's spake unto you

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,520
when he was yet in Galilee.

74
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,139
This truth of the resurrection was something

75
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,960
that Jesus had spoken of often

76
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,880
throughout his earthly ministry.

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,279
And we find that he had made the declaration

78
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,240
that he would need to suffer

79
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,139
and he would pay for the sin of mankind,

80
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,759
but that he would rise in victory.

81
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,160
And we come to chapter number 24 and verse number 13,

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,520
and really verses 13 through 35,

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,100
provide for us the record of these two disciples

84
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,520
that are walking back on the road to Emmaus.

85
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Now, as we think about the journey of these two disciples

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,199
and we notice their interaction with our risen savior,

87
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,000
we find that they're there, they had been in Jerusalem.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,839
If you look at verse number 12 of Luke chapter number 24,

89
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,039
the Bible says, then arose Peter

90
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,320
and ran unto the sepulcher and stooping down,

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,419
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves

92
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,539
and departed wondering in himself

93
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,600
at that which was come to pass.

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,380
And behold, two of them went that same day

95
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,220
to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem,

96
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,420
about three score furlongs.

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,179
It's roughly 6.8 mile journey

98
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,339
that these two disciples would take.

99
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,540
And as they would return there to Emmaus,

100
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,660
of course, you think about all of the things

101
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,700
that have happened in these days

102
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,459
leading up to the record here in Luke chapter number 24.

103
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,820
In fact, as they're speaking with Jesus in verse number 18,

104
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,380
it says, and the one of them whose name was Cleopas

105
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,059
answering said unto him,

106
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,459
art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem

107
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,500
and hast not known the things

108
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,679
which are come to pass there in these days?

109
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:57,399
And he, Jesus, saith unto them, what things?

110
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,899
And they said unto him, concerning Jesus of Nazareth,

111
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,859
which was a prophet mighty indeed

112
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,299
and word before God and all the people.

113
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:10,279
You understand that he's so much more

114
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,959
than just a prophet.

115
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,559
Yes, he fulfilled the role of prophet, priest, and king,

116
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,239
but we understand that he is God in flesh.

117
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,760
It says in verse number 20,

118
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,720
and how the chief priest and our rulers

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,119
delivered him to be condemned to death

120
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,239
and have crucified him.

121
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,679
But we trusted that it had been he

122
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,799
which should have redeemed Israel.

123
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:34,600
And beside all this, today is the third day

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
since these things were done.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,279
And as they're walking and conversing,

126
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,320
we find that Jesus, according to verse number 27,

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
beginning at Moses and all the prophets,

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
he expounded unto them in all the scriptures

129
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,959
the things concerning himself.

130
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,519
They got to their destination

131
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,519
and Jesus had made as if he was going to continue on his way

132
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,839
and they besought him to come into the home.

133
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,600
And we find that it's there in verse number 29

134
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,959
that they constrained him

135
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,359
and they asked him to tarry.

136
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,399
In verse number 30,

137
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,399
and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them,

138
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,119
he took bread and blessed it

139
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,119
and break and gave to them.

140
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:21,119
And verse 31, their eyes were opened and they knew him.

141
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,200
And he vanished out of their sight.

142
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,239
Can you imagine these two disciples?

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,640
What an amazing record that we have

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,359
by way of introduction to our text this morning.

145
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,200
And we find that the Bible says

146
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,720
that they begin to speak one to another

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
and they say this in verse number 32,

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,320
did not our heart burn within us

149
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,959
while he talked with us by the way?

150
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,119
And while he opened to us the scriptures,

151
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,799
they then quickly are going to return to Jerusalem.

152
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:58,119
The Bible says, now be mindful of the timeline here.

153
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,359
They've just walked nearly seven miles

154
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,920
from Jerusalem to Emmaus.

155
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
They declare to Jesus

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,279
that they wanted him to tarry with them.

157
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,119
Why?

158
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,959
In verse number 29,

159
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,200
for it is toward evening and the day is far spent.

160
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,959
But yet when they understood

161
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,559
that they had had this encounter with the risen savior,

162
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:21,040
the Bible tells us that at the same hour

163
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,559
in verse number 33,

164
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,359
they returned to Jerusalem.

165
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,399
As they returned to Jerusalem,

166
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,640
they found gathered the 11 there in verse number 33

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,519
and they make this declaration in verse 34,

168
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,000
the Lord is risen indeed,

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,880
and hath appeared to Simon.

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,519
And it says, as they told what things were done in the way

171
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,320
and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

172
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,760
So really what's happening here

173
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
is they returned to Jerusalem.

174
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,559
They find the 11 disciples gathered together

175
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,399
and they begin,

176
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,239
can you see the passion and the enthusiasm?

177
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,399
I mean, can you imagine the excitement

178
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,160
that these two had

179
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,359
because of what they had just experienced

180
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:05,440
and the encounter that they had with their risen savior.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,119
And the Bible says that they're speaking to these disciples

182
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,040
and it says in verse number 36,

183
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,239
and as they thus spake,

184
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:19,200
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,920
Can you imagine?

186
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,239
I mean, get the picture here this morning

187
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,440
in your mind's eye.

188
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
These disciples returned,

189
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,040
the 11 were not sure what they were doing,

190
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
but these two returned from Emmaus.

191
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,239
They had walked 6.8 miles to Emmaus

192
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,880
and they had spoken with the Lord Jesus Christ

193
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,440
and they turned and walked 6.8 miles back to Jerusalem.

194
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
And they say, guys, listen,

195
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,760
the Lord has appeared to us

196
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
and the Lord is risen indeed.

197
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,599
And as they're sharing this good news,

198
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,359
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,679
Awesome.

200
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,919
I mean, my mind cannot fully comprehend

201
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,280
the joy that must have flooded the hearts

202
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,679
of those two individuals.

203
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,919
We know what's gonna happen.

204
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,039
Jesus asked them why they're fearful

205
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,280
and so on and so forth of those 11.

206
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
But I think about the excitement.

207
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Can you imagine?

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,599
As they're speaking and declaring this great message

209
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,840
and then Jesus himself is there.

210
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,200
You know, one day we will see him face to face.

211
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,799
What a glorious, wonderful day that will be.

212
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,159
And I'm looking forward to that day.

213
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,559
I'm looking forward to seeing my Savior.

214
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,440
He's alive forevermore and he's promised

215
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
that he's going to come back

216
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,719
and to receive us unto himself,

217
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,200
that where he is, we may be also.

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,599
As we look at our passage,

219
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,919
I want you to notice first of all,

220
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,760
if you're taking notes,

221
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,159
the appearance of the risen Savior.

222
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,039
In verses 36 through 43,

223
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,559
we see the appearance of the risen Savior.

224
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,119
It's of note, as I've mentioned now,

225
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,159
as they thus spake,

226
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,520
these two were speaking to the disciples

227
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,559
that are gathered there,

228
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,799
according to verse number 33.

229
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,960
And it says that Jesus stood in.

230
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:08,320
And Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."

231
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,200
As you look at this scene and you find what's taking place, I want you to consider a few

232
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,280
things about the appearance of our risen Savior.

233
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,940
Notice number one, consider what He said.

234
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,000
Number one, He says, Peace be unto you.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,840
In verse number 36, I'm so thankful for the peace of God.

236
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,880
We have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, but we have the peace of God, which

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
passeth all understanding.

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,840
Jesus said this in John 14 and verse number 27, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give

239
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,120
unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

240
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

241
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,080
Oh, I'm so thankful for the peace of God.

242
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,280
We're living in a world in which very few people understand the true peace of God.

243
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,680
And what a joy to know the peace of God.

244
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,220
We are commanded to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

245
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,520
We find that the initial greeting of the Lord Jesus Christ, our risen Savior, as He appears

246
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,720
there in that place, He says, Peace be unto you.

247
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,080
We find that it then tells us of their response, but they were terrified and affrighted and

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,480
supposed that they had seen a spirit.

249
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,440
You understand that Jesus is going to, in just a few moments, help them understand that

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,840
they've not seen a spirit, but truly they are seeing the risen Savior.

251
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,440
His bodily resurrection from the dead.

252
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,600
He then says, as we're considering the things that Jesus says to them, in verse number 38,

253
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,040
He says this, Why are you troubled?

254
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,400
Why are you troubled?

255
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,520
And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

256
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,440
We know the answer.

257
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,400
They do not provide an answer as to why they were troubled.

258
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,200
It tells us in verse 37 that they supposed that they had seen a spirit.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,080
And we understand contextually what's going on here and why they're troubled.

260
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,760
But I ask you this morning, why are you troubled?

261
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,240
What is it that's troubled you?

262
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,560
No doubt, we're living in a time of much chaos and confusion and there are people that

263
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,400
are troubled.

264
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,840
But yet Jesus says, Let not your heart be troubled.

265
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,280
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

266
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
In My Father's house are many mansions.

267
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
If it were not so, I would have told you.

268
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,320
I go to prepare a place for you.

269
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,280
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,000
that where I am, there ye may be also.

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,480
Let not your heart be troubled.

272
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,640
We serve the risen Savior.

273
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,920
He lives.

274
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,420
He's conquered sin, death, and the grave.

275
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,000
He's alive forevermore.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,840
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

277
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,480
He'll never be defeated.

278
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,980
He's never made a mistake.

279
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,160
He knows where you are.

280
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
He knows where I am.

281
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,600
He knows what we're dealing with and yet He's still in control of everything.

282
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,960
Let not your heart be troubled.

283
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,440
Why are you troubled?

284
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,840
The answer for these disciples may be different than the answer that you would offer this

285
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,760
morning, but maybe some have come this morning with a troubled heart.

286
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,280
You're just troubled with the things in our world.

287
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
You're troubled with whatever's going on.

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,440
Can I say that Jesus says, Why are you troubled?

289
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Can I tell you this morning that He'll give you peace as you get close to Him and enter

290
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,200
into His presence?

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,920
As you get into this book, He'll give you a peace that passeth all understanding.

292
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,280
It is an absolute joy to know the peace of God.

293
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,540
In the midst of turmoil, chaos, and confusion, we can have peace.

294
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,260
Some have wrongly described peace as being the absence of trouble.

295
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,800
You know that man is going to have trouble.

296
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,280
I just read the book of Job earlier this week.

297
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,400
Man that is born of woman has a few days and a whole lot of trouble, amen?

298
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,400
The reality is that we face trouble and tribulation and difficulty.

299
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,720
We understand that.

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,000
The reality is that peace is not the absence of trouble, rather peace is found in the very

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,920
presence of God Almighty.

302
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,040
Though the storm may be raging, though all seems to be out of control, we must recognize

303
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
that our God has everything under control.

304
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,320
In any moment, He can say as He stood upon that boat that day and said to those storms,

305
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,920
the winds and the waves, peace, be still.

306
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,480
His creation obeys Him.

307
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,800
Listen, one day the trumpet of the Lord is going to sound and all this craziness, God's

308
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,840
going to show that He's in control, amen?

309
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,600
His plan is going to be fulfilled.

310
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,400
No one is going to overcome and conquer our risen Savior.

311
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,520
He's victorious, amen?

312
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Why are you troubled?

313
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,440
Do you notice what He says to the disciples?

314
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Why?

315
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Why are you troubled?

316
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,360
Why are you troubled?

317
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,520
We find that He continues in the things that He says to the disciples, the appearance of

318
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,880
our risen Savior.

319
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:35,840
Verse 39, notice what He says, Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.

320
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
Handle me and see.

321
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
What's He saying?

322
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,840
He's showing them the evidence.

323
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,520
He has conquered sin, death, and the grave, and He's alive forevermore, the bodily resurrection

324
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,520
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and He says, listen, behold my hands.

325
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
What do the hands have?

326
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,760
The hands have the prints of the nails.

327
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,960
Behold my feet, that it is I myself.

328
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Handle me and see.

329
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:11,400
And then notice what He says, For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

330
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

331
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,040
And it says this in verse number 40, And as He had thus spoken, He showed them His

332
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,480
hands and His feet.

333
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,000
Can you imagine being in this place?

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,680
It says in verse 41, And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them,

335
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Have ye here any meat?

336
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,520
You know, sometimes we too are slow to believe.

337
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Sometimes we're like Gideon.

338
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,640
Lord, if you're really going to deliver me, if you're going to use me in this manner,

339
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,440
would you let there be some due here but not here?

340
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,440
And then God does it exactly as Gideon requested.

341
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
And then Gideon says, well, I'm going to need some more help on this.

342
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
Let's reverse it and let there be some due here but not there.

343
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,120
And then God does it.

344
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,880
See, sometimes we're slow to believe.

345
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,500
Sometimes we need some more supporting evidence, if you will.

346
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,780
And we find that Jesus, you know, aren't you thankful that our God is patient with

347
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,780
us?

348
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:24,220
Aren't you thankful that He gives us truth and He's long-suffering toward us?

349
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,860
And we find here in the text of Scripture not only what He said, but I consider what

350
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,580
He did as the Bible would say to us that it says that while they yet believed not for

351
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,500
joy and wondered, He said unto them, notice He says, have ye here any meat?

352
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,900
Now what's He going to do?

353
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Well, we find that first He showed them His hands and feet, but now in verses 42 and 43,

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,020
He's going to eat before them.

355
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,260
It says this, and they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb, and He

356
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,460
took it and did eat before them.

357
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,100
He's giving them the evidence that it is, as He says in verse number 39, that it is

358
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,780
I Myself.

359
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:19,060
He's proving to them with more than sufficient evidence that He is the risen Savior.

360
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:25,300
We find that here as we would couple Luke's account and look at what the Bible would tell

361
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,100
us, and you don't need to turn there, but in Acts chapter number 1, we find that Luke

362
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,980
uses this terminology in verse number 3, to whom also He showed Himself alive after

363
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,440
His passion.

364
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,980
Notice this phraseology, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days and

365
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,320
speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

366
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,780
He gave them many infallible proofs, and as we look here in Luke's gospel and Luke's account,

367
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,420
we consider what He said, and we consider what He did.

368
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,140
We notice and we take note of the appearance of our risen Savior as we continue through

369
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,380
the passage of Scripture.

370
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,940
I want you to notice the assignment given in verses 44 through 49.

371
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,240
As we look at the assignment given, we find that first, before the Lord Jesus Christ will

372
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,700
explain the assignment, we find that He initially is going to remind them of what He had previously

373
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,100
taught, notice with me in verse number 44, and He said unto them, These are the words

374
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,340
which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which

375
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,559
were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me.

376
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,700
You read through the Old Testament and you read about the prophecies concerning not only

377
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,540
the coming of Messiah, but you read the prophecies with regard to the crucifixion of Messiah.

378
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,260
You read the prophecies not only of the crucifixion of Messiah, but you read the prophecies of

379
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
the resurrection of Messiah.

380
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,020
Remember, it's there in the book of Psalms, and He references there to the Psalms.

381
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,300
in this particular passage of Scripture, but we're finding the truth according to

382
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,780
Psalm 2 in verse number 7, I will declare the decree, the Lord hath said

383
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,740
unto me, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. You understand that he's

384
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,260
speaking of the resurrection there in Psalm 2. He's not speaking of the

385
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,740
first coming, the incarnation, he's speaking of the resurrection, and the

386
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,820
reason that we understand that and know that is as we compare Scripture with

387
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,460
Scripture, the Bible tells us in Acts chapter number 13, as the preaching of

388
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,980
the Word of God is going forth and Paul is preaching, what a great opportunity he

389
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,780
has. He says this with regard, it's right in the middle of his message, but in Acts

390
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,740
13 and verse 28, and though they found no cause of death in him, speaking of Jesus

391
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,700
the Messiah, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had

392
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,660
fulfilled all that was written of him, there you see that again, the fulfillment

393
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,500
of all those things that were written in the Old Testament, they took him down

394
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,700
from the tree and laid him in a sepulcher. But God raised him from the

395
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,780
dead, and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to

396
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,260
Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad

397
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,900
tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled

398
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:30,900
the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again, as it is

399
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,180
also written in the second Psalm, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.

400
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,060
By the way, those fellows there in Acts chapter 13, they got a

401
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,460
whole lot more than they bargained for when they gave Paul the opportunity to

402
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,420
preach. And he went ahead and just delivered a message, they said, if you

403
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,540
have anything to say, say on. And he said, all right, let's go, amen, and what a

404
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:59,140
blessing. And he gave the gospel, and he spoke about these proofs, these

405
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,140
fulfillments of these Old Testament prophecies, and we find that Jesus is

406
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,300
reminding them, the disciples back in Luke chapter number 24, in verses 44 and

407
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,460
45, he's reminding them of these things that he had previously taught. It says in

408
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,740
verse number 45, then opened he their understanding that they might understand

409
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,980
the Scriptures. Isn't that a blessing, to understand the Word of God? It's God's

410
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,140
Word, and he can open our understanding. We speak about illumining the Scriptures,

411
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,420
and we speak about the truth of Psalm 119, in verse 18, open down mine eyes that

412
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,500
I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. The entrance of thy words giveth

413
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,260
light, and what a joy to understand the Scriptures, the Word of God, and here we

414
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,900
find that Jesus, the risen Savior, he's reminding them of what he had

415
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,500
previously taught. Then he's going to explain to them what was

416
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,860
accomplished through his death, burial, and glorious resurrection. Notice with me

417
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,980
in verse number 46, he said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behooved

418
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:20,220
Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day. What was accomplished?

419
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,780
What was the purpose? We understand, as we studied last Sunday morning from 1st

420
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,940
Timothy, that the Bible says this is a faithful saying and

421
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,740
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save

422
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,480
sinners, of whom I am chief, and we spoke about the fact that Jesus was going to

423
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,520
save sinners. How was he going to do that? Through his death, burial, and

424
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,440
resurrection. You understand that if he just died and was buried but did not

425
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,240
arise, that he would not. It's evidence, the resurrection is evidence of the

426
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,280
acceptance of the payment that was made on the cross of Calvary. And we find

427
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,320
here that he did rise, and so you notice that he says it was written and it

428
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,720
behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day. Why? Notice

429
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,480
verse 47, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in

430
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:24,600
his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem. The reality is that as the

431
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Lord Jesus Christ is giving this assignment, before he gets to the details

432
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
of the assignment, we find that he reminds them of what he had taught, but

433
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,080
then he explains to them what was accomplished at Calvary and the

434
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,000
resurrection. What was it that was accomplished? Well, now we find that it is

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,600
finished as John would record when Jesus, before he took his final breath, he

436
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,520
declared, it is finished. We find here that he says that repentance and

437
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,680
remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at

438
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,680
Jerusalem. We now have this story, the fulfillment of all of these Old

439
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,840
Testament prophets. You think about the amazing nature of all that has

440
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,600
happened with regard to the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, and

441
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,920
you consider with me the way that the Old Testament saints, by faith, would look

442
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,800
forward to the day that Messiah would come and to the Messiah going and

443
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,440
being our Passover. All of those offerings that they would offer and the

444
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
priests that would daily stand and minister and offering those same

445
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,760
offerings day by day, year by year, that could never take away sin, but it was a

446
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,440
picture of Messiah who would now come, and now as Jesus is proclaiming and

447
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,240
sharing with these disciples and with us what was accomplished, it's been paid for,

448
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:02,760
it's done, it's over, I have finished the work. Now go preach repentance of sins,

449
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,400
remission of sins, and what a joy and what a blessing. Aren't you thankful this

450
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,800
morning that you can declare that God loves individuals and that you can

451
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,040
declare that Jesus saves? They played this morning, we sang some wonderful hymns

452
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,840
this morning, but the song that they played for the offertory was what? It was

453
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,880
Jesus saves. And I'm so thankful for that declaration, and we can shout it out

454
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,040
and we can share it with individuals. Why? Because of what he did on the cross of

455
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,600
Calvary and what was accomplished. I'm so thankful that God, I was

456
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,360
praying this week and as I was just meditating upon all that he's done for

457
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,240
me and all that he is to me and just being a wonderful Savior, I was mindful

458
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:54,160
this week about the truth of only one way of salvation. I was reminded and I

459
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,160
was thankful, and I thank the Lord for this specifically, I was thankful that in

460
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,000
his wisdom that he did not determine that we could get to heaven by our own

461
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
works. He could have determined that. And then how would we ever know if we ever

462
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,640
did enough? How would we ever know? How could we ever have peace? How could we

463
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,040
ever have joy? How could we know when we royally messed it up how many good

464
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,680
things it just wiped out? You understand what I mean? Y'all ever have a bad day?

465
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,440
We watched Fireproof last night. How many of you have ever seen Fireproof? It's a good

466
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
movie. Oh, Caleb out there, I don't know what is Mr., what's his name? The Neighbor.

467
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,880
Mr. Rudolph. How many of y'all seen that movie, man? Mr. Rudolph was out there and

468
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,240
he's standing there and Caleb's beating that trash can, man, he had a bad day, you

469
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,680
know what I mean? And he says, Mr. Rudolph, and he says, Caleb, and then he tells

470
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:55,080
his wife, don't talk to that guy, you know? But he had a bad day. I'm so thankful it's

471
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,880
not about my own works. Man, what a terrible way it would be to live, not

472
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,560
knowing day by day, have I done enough? How could I ever know? Oh, I was thanking

473
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:17,480
Him this week that that's not the way of salvation because we'd never know. I was

474
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,840
thanking Him this morning that it's not just a pick-your-own-way and all roads lead

475
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:36,119
to. No. The truth of God's Word is that Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

476
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:44,440
No man cometh unto the Father but by me. Peter stood in Acts chapter number four after

477
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,760
that great miracle in Acts chapter number three of that lame man that was healed. Oh,

478
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,000
how it caused a stir there in Jerusalem. He says, if we're called in question this day

479
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,600
of these things that have happened, I want you to know that by the name of Jesus Christ

480
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,360
of Nazareth, this man was made whole. It wasn't in Peter's power. It wasn't in John's power.

481
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,960
It was in the power of our resurrected Savior. Peter said, neither is there salvation in

482
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,160
any other. For there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be

483
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:29,520
saved. And that God, in His infinite wisdom, devised a plan for redemption requiring the

484
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:38,400
blood sacrifice, and Jesus paid it all. Oh, how it's rejoicing to just be mindful of

485
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,280
that wonderful truth that we hold dear, that we are privileged to receive. And so Jesus

486
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:54,320
is explaining to them what was accomplished. Why did Jesus have to go to the cross? Because

487
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,760
there's no other way for a man to be redeemed. Why did He have to suffer such a horrific

488
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,040
death?

489
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:09,760
because he loves you and he paid for your sin we've been bought with a price

490
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,520
oh he says this is what was accomplished notice he finally will explain their

491
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,800
assignment notice with me in verse 48 it says and ye are witnesses of these

492
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,880
things oh he puts the responsibility right on him doesn't he I mean square on

493
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,400
their shoulders I want you to understand what I've accomplished I want you to

494
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
understand what has been accomplished in these days and paying for the sin of

495
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,760
mankind that now repentance and remission of sin should be preached to

496
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,480
all people to all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these

497
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,400
things I'm thankful that not only did he tell them that they were witnesses of

498
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,960
these things but they he told them that they would be empowered by God the Holy

499
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,880
Spirit notice in verse 49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you

500
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,920
but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on

501
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,480
high we don't do the work of God our own power we go on the power of the Holy

502
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,760
Spirit of God we have the promise that Jesus said I am with you and we have the

503
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,880
promise there in Acts chapter number one in verse number eight but you shall

504
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,400
receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be

505
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,520
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost

506
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,360
part of the earth and you find here notice the the purpose the assignment if

507
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,040
you will in verse number 47 that repentance and remission of sins should

508
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,000
be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem how is

509
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,440
this monumental task going to be accomplished ye are his witnesses and we

510
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:01,120
go in the power of the Holy Spirit we notice the appearance of our resurrected

511
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,840
Savior I mean can you imagine it's late at night 11 are gathered I'm not sure

512
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,200
what they're discussing the Bible doesn't tell us but these two that

513
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,680
return from Emmaus with excitement the Lord has risen indeed and as they're

514
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:27,200
sharing these things Jesus himself appears he says it is me I mean look at

515
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,960
my hands look at my feet do you have any bread he eats and then he gives them an

516
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,040
assignment your witnesses of these things notice as we conclude the passage

517
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,400
of Scripture here in the book of Luke number three if you're taking notes

518
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:51,000
notice the ascension of our risen Savior and he in verse number 50 Jesus he led

519
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,200
them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and

520
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:07,720
it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into

521
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,640
heaven can you imagine often we read the account in Acts chapter 1 of the

522
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,640
ascension of Jesus Christ they were standing there and just before their

523
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,040
very eyes at the end of those 40 days after he made these appearances and all

524
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,920
that takes place he ascends into heaven we know as we look at the whole of

525
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,480
Scripture that that's where he is even at this moment the right hand of the

526
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,080
Father ever live ever living as the Scripture saying Hebrews 725 that he

527
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,360
ever liveth to make intercession for us and it just the exact time he's coming

528
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,880
back for us what a blessed truth and we find that these disciples I mean think

529
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,160
about all that has happened and now the the Lord is is going to ascend back up

530
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:04,040
into heaven and the Bible says remember he said I go to my father it says that

531
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,240
they worshipped him and look at how they returned to Jerusalem in verse number 52

532
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:17,760
with great joy with great joy listen as we leave here in just a little while as

533
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,520
we go on our journey that we call life we ought to have great joy why because

534
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,040
we serve a risen Savior why because he's ascended to heaven and he's living to

535
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,080
make intercession for us why because one day he's coming back for me it is the

536
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,720
hope of every believer that we would see him face to face as I mentioned in our

537
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,000
outdoor service this morning hope is not some wishful thinking pie in the sky

538
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,320
hope is based upon truth that God has given us it is confidence based upon a

539
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,240
promise from God's Word that's hope that's Bible hope amen we have great

540
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,560
hope we ought to have great joy I mean listen there ought to be something

541
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,320
noticeably different about us in our behavior our actions and how we interact

542
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,600
with the things are going on in life why are you so different why does this not

543
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,640
cause you to be depressed and down and troubled man because my eyes are on

544
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,200
Jesus and he lives he's coming back for me people gonna think you're crazy man

545
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,080
and that's okay because they're gonna want some of what you have amen we find

546
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,560
in verse number 53 they return to Jerusalem with great joy according verse

547
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,640
52 and verse 53 and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing God

548
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,000
amen I want you to think just for a moment as we wrap up this morning I

549
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,080
want you to think about not only the importance of the Ascension of Jesus

550
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,000
Christ we see that record here but I want you to think about the impact of

551
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,680
all of these events not only the the appearance of our Lord and Savior the

552
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,280
assignment the Ascension I want you to think about the early church and we

553
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,720
don't have time this morning to really review much of the book of Acts but just

554
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,080
by way of brief overview you understand that these disciples they embrace the

555
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,080
assignment they embraced it it's interesting it's not recorded here in

556
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,120
in Luke's account but in Acts 1 the Bible tells us that those angels that

557
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,280
stood by as as Jesus was ascended up into heaven that that those disciples it

558
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,760
tells us in in Acts Luke also is the human penman of this book and we find

559
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,120
the Bible tells us in verse number 10 and that they look steadfastly toward

560
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,800
heaven I mean he was he was ascended in verse number 9 and when he had spoken

561
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,440
these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of

562
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,080
their sight in verse 10 while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he

563
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,640
went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men

564
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:11,000
of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus know what it

565
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:20,040
says this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven notice shall so

566
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,960
come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven

567
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:33,040
oh man I think the impact upon these disciples as you see they tarried in

568
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,760
Jerusalem as Jesus had told him and then they were endued with power from on high

569
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:44,880
and you find that they turned the world upside down why I believe that they

570
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,960
believe that Jesus was coming amen I mean it motivated them to service it

571
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,840
caught listen they loved the Lord and they had embraced the assignment and they

572
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,880
had heard from the angels that this same Jesus is coming back he didn't give

573
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,120
him a time and we know now that nearly 2,000 years has passed but doesn't make

574
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:14,720
the promise any less of a promise in fact we're a day closer every day amen I

575
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,640
don't know the day no man knoweth the day nor the hour so what the Word of God

576
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,720
says but man he's coming work for the night is coming oh we embrace the

577
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,800
promise we embrace the assignment I hope this morning as we celebrate Easter we

578
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,480
celebrate the resurrection we look at this account in Luke chapter number 24

579
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,560
that we can allow in our sanctified imaginations to see that setting of

580
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,680
those disciples gathered together the news that they had received in the

581
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,920
appearance of our risen Savior the assignment that was given later on his

582
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:06,600
ascension that we would have great joy knowing that we serve a risen Savior

583
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:13,240
there's no problem that you will ever encounter that's too big for God no

584
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,640
nothing I'm not saying that there's not gonna problem that you're gonna

585
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,360
encounter and by the way the problem might be too big for you but that's a

586
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,760
good thing amen you ever been in place we say I don't know what to do

587
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,280
everybody's been there except for God amen I look at this I mean I don't know

588
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,760
what to do I need wisdom we serve a risen Savior there's no problem there

589
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,480
might be problems too hard for me too hard for you there's no problem too

590
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,200
hard for God oh that we'd have joy that we would truly allow the the reality of

591
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,680
the resurrection to influence and impact our lives that we would live with a

592
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,240
certain level of excitement

593
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,840
joy and peace, because we serve a risen Savior, and we know that He's coming again. Amen?

594
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:15,640
The Lord Himself stood in the midst of them, and one day, one glorious day,

595
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,160
we shall see Him face to face. Let us pray. Father, we love You this morning.

596
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,720
Oh, how we thank You for loving us. How we thank You for Your Word.

597
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,160
No doubt in my mind that those that are gathered here this morning

598
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,120
believe that You have risen from the dead, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

599
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,520
Perhaps there's one, whether here or on livestream,

600
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,640
that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

601
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,680
They've never accepted the free gift of eternal life.

602
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,600
Maybe today, Lord, we pray that it would be the day of salvation for that individual.

603
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,840
The Holy Spirit of God would convince them of their sin,

604
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,000
of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come. Lord, maybe there's one, maybe there's many

605
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,840
gathered here locally, tuned in via livestream, that are troubled.

606
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:32,440
Many things in our world seek to trouble.

607
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:42,040
We know that even the people of God can be impacted adversely. Jesus said,

608
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:50,920
why are you troubled? He said, before He would ever go to that cross, let not your heart be troubled.

609
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,480
Oh, God, I pray that You'd give us a peace that passeth all understanding.

610
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,280
I pray, God, that You would help us to embrace the assignment even as the disciples did.

611
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,920
Oh, that it would be said of us that we have filled this place with the gospel.

612
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,920
It's what they said of the disciples, you filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

613
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:22,440
Oh, that they'd say that you filled Oakton and Vienna and Fairfax with your doctrine.

614
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:30,680
How glorious that would be. Lord, I pray that You'd empower us and that You would use us,

615
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,920
help us to have joy, peace, and hope. We pray that You'd move and work as only You can,

616
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,680
for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

617
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,840
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar is open. You can make

618
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,120
your pew and altar. You can come up here to this altar. Why don't you thank God?

619
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:59,240
Why don't you ask God to use you as we have this moment of invitation this morning?
