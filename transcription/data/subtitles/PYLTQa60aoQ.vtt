WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
And we're so thankful for the truth of the word of God.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.960
I'm so thankful that he went to that cruel cross.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.399
He was buried in that borrowed tomb

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.159
and he rose in victory,

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.039
conquering sin, death, and the grave, amen.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.920
And he is risen, hallelujah.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.360
And what a joy.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.440
And the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.079
is the cornerstone of our faith.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.459
And I mentioned this morning during our outdoor service,

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.180
I read from the portion of scripture,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.520
not only in the book of Matthew,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.099
but also there in the book of 1 Corinthians

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.700
and looked at a portion of scripture

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180
from 2 Timothy chapter number two.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.659
But there in 1 Corinthians chapter number 15,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.259
of course, we understand that Paul tells us

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.180
that if Christ be not risen,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.779
then our preaching is vain, our faith is vain,

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:50.700
we are yet in our sins,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.139
but now is Christ risen from the dead, amen.

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.259
And what a blessing.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:57.700
It is the cornerstone of our faith

00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:01.819
and we are rejoicing today in the certain knowledge

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.779
that God has given us that he ever liveth

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.699
to make intercession for us.

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.220
Luke 24, I'll be looking at verses 36 through 53.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.739
And let me just read verse number 36

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.900
and then we'll get into the message this morning.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.379
The Bible says, and as they thus spake,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.739
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.699
and saith unto them, peace be unto you.

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:29.459
As you can tell in the bulletin this morning,

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.379
I've titled the message, Jesus stood in the midst of them.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.239
We'll be looking at Luke 24, verses 36 through 53.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.739
But before we get there,

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.419
by way of introduction this morning,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.419
I'd like to really kind of set the scene, if you will,

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:46.040
before we dive into our text this morning.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.459
We understand that it's in Luke chapter number 23

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.980
that God provides for us a record of the trial,

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.019
the crucifixion, and the burial

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:56.699
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.699
By the way, I'm thankful that he endured

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.739
such contradiction of sinners, amen,

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.339
for the joy that was set before him,

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:06.379
according to Hebrews chapter number 12.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.360
And what a blessing to know that he took my place,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.860
he took your place on that cruel cross,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.940
and he paid for the sin of all mankind.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.139
We find that it's in Luke chapter number 24

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.300
that as we begin reading this particular chapter

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.940
and the first few verses,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.660
that God provides for us the record

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.179
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.179
The tomb, it could not hold him, amen.

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.940
And yes, he was buried there, yes, he died.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.580
He was really dead.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.500
He fully paid for the sin of mankind

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.740
and he went into that tomb.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.820
But as the kids said, as we read earlier,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.820
as we've been singing, the angel said,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.020
he is not here, for he is risen.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.779
As he said.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.580
We find that it's there in Luke chapter number 24,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.740
or in the beginning portion here,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.259
that Jesus appears and we find the resurrection

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.539
and the angels giving information

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.380
to those that were at the tomb first.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.020
And you read in verse number six,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.660
he is not here, but is risen.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.500
And then notice this, remember how he's spake unto you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.520
when he was yet in Galilee.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.139
This truth of the resurrection was something

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.960
that Jesus had spoken of often

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.880
throughout his earthly ministry.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.279
And we find that he had made the declaration

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.240
that he would need to suffer

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.139
and he would pay for the sin of mankind,

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.759
but that he would rise in victory.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.160
And we come to chapter number 24 and verse number 13,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.520
and really verses 13 through 35,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.100
provide for us the record of these two disciples

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.520
that are walking back on the road to Emmaus.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.320
Now, as we think about the journey of these two disciples

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.199
and we notice their interaction with our risen savior,

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.000
we find that they're there, they had been in Jerusalem.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.839
If you look at verse number 12 of Luke chapter number 24,

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.039
the Bible says, then arose Peter

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.320
and ran unto the sepulcher and stooping down,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.419
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.539
and departed wondering in himself

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.600
at that which was come to pass.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.380
And behold, two of them went that same day

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.220
to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.420
about three score furlongs.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.179
It's roughly 6.8 mile journey

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:26.339
that these two disciples would take.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:29.540
And as they would return there to Emmaus,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.660
of course, you think about all of the things

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.700
that have happened in these days

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.459
leading up to the record here in Luke chapter number 24.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:41.820
In fact, as they're speaking with Jesus in verse number 18,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.380
it says, and the one of them whose name was Cleopas

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.059
answering said unto him,

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.459
art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:50.500
and hast not known the things

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.679
which are come to pass there in these days?

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:57.399
And he, Jesus, saith unto them, what things?

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.899
And they said unto him, concerning Jesus of Nazareth,

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.859
which was a prophet mighty indeed

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:08.299
and word before God and all the people.

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.279
You understand that he's so much more

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.959
than just a prophet.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.559
Yes, he fulfilled the role of prophet, priest, and king,

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.239
but we understand that he is God in flesh.

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:19.760
It says in verse number 20,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.720
and how the chief priest and our rulers

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.119
delivered him to be condemned to death

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:26.239
and have crucified him.

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.679
But we trusted that it had been he

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.799
which should have redeemed Israel.

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:34.600
And beside all this, today is the third day

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.000
since these things were done.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.279
And as they're walking and conversing,

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.320
we find that Jesus, according to verse number 27,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.880
beginning at Moses and all the prophets,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.440
he expounded unto them in all the scriptures

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.959
the things concerning himself.

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:54.519
They got to their destination

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.519
and Jesus had made as if he was going to continue on his way

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:01.839
and they besought him to come into the home.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.600
And we find that it's there in verse number 29

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.959
that they constrained him

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.359
and they asked him to tarry.

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:09.399
In verse number 30,

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.399
and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them,

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.119
he took bread and blessed it

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.119
and break and gave to them.

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:21.119
And verse 31, their eyes were opened and they knew him.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.200
And he vanished out of their sight.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.239
Can you imagine these two disciples?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.640
What an amazing record that we have

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.359
by way of introduction to our text this morning.

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:36.200
And we find that the Bible says

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.720
that they begin to speak one to another

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.000
and they say this in verse number 32,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.320
did not our heart burn within us

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.959
while he talked with us by the way?

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:51.119
And while he opened to us the scriptures,

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.799
they then quickly are going to return to Jerusalem.

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:58.119
The Bible says, now be mindful of the timeline here.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.359
They've just walked nearly seven miles

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:02.920
from Jerusalem to Emmaus.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.920
They declare to Jesus

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.279
that they wanted him to tarry with them.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.119
Why?

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.959
In verse number 29,

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:13.200
for it is toward evening and the day is far spent.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.959
But yet when they understood

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.559
that they had had this encounter with the risen savior,

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.040
the Bible tells us that at the same hour

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.559
in verse number 33,

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.359
they returned to Jerusalem.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.399
As they returned to Jerusalem,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.640
they found gathered the 11 there in verse number 33

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.519
and they make this declaration in verse 34,

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:38.000
the Lord is risen indeed,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.880
and hath appeared to Simon.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.519
And it says, as they told what things were done in the way

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.320
and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.760
So really what's happening here

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.880
is they returned to Jerusalem.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.559
They find the 11 disciples gathered together

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:52.399
and they begin,

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.239
can you see the passion and the enthusiasm?

00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:57.399
I mean, can you imagine the excitement

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:59.160
that these two had

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.359
because of what they had just experienced

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:05.440
and the encounter that they had with their risen savior.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.119
And the Bible says that they're speaking to these disciples

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:11.040
and it says in verse number 36,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.239
and as they thus spake,

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:19.200
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.920
Can you imagine?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.239
I mean, get the picture here this morning

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:24.440
in your mind's eye.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.760
These disciples returned,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.040
the 11 were not sure what they were doing,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.920
but these two returned from Emmaus.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.239
They had walked 6.8 miles to Emmaus

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:34.880
and they had spoken with the Lord Jesus Christ

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.440
and they turned and walked 6.8 miles back to Jerusalem.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.200
And they say, guys, listen,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.760
the Lord has appeared to us

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.080
and the Lord is risen indeed.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.599
And as they're sharing this good news,

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:50.359
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.679
Awesome.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:55.919
I mean, my mind cannot fully comprehend

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:59.280
the joy that must have flooded the hearts

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.679
of those two individuals.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.919
We know what's gonna happen.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:04.039
Jesus asked them why they're fearful

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:06.280
and so on and so forth of those 11.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.840
But I think about the excitement.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.320
Can you imagine?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.599
As they're speaking and declaring this great message

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:15.840
and then Jesus himself is there.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:19.200
You know, one day we will see him face to face.

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:24.799
What a glorious, wonderful day that will be.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.159
And I'm looking forward to that day.

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:29.559
I'm looking forward to seeing my Savior.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:32.440
He's alive forevermore and he's promised

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.880
that he's going to come back

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.719
and to receive us unto himself,

00:09:35.719 --> 00:09:38.200
that where he is, we may be also.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.599
As we look at our passage,

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:40.919
I want you to notice first of all,

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:41.760
if you're taking notes,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.159
the appearance of the risen Savior.

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.039
In verses 36 through 43,

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.559
we see the appearance of the risen Savior.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.119
It's of note, as I've mentioned now,

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:52.159
as they thus spake,

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.520
these two were speaking to the disciples

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.559
that are gathered there,

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.799
according to verse number 33.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.960
And it says that Jesus stood in.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:08.320
And Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.200
As you look at this scene and you find what's taking place, I want you to consider a few

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.280
things about the appearance of our risen Savior.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.940
Notice number one, consider what He said.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.000
Number one, He says, Peace be unto you.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.840
In verse number 36, I'm so thankful for the peace of God.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.880
We have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, but we have the peace of God, which

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.800
passeth all understanding.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.840
Jesus said this in John 14 and verse number 27, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.120
unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.080
Oh, I'm so thankful for the peace of God.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.280
We're living in a world in which very few people understand the true peace of God.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.680
And what a joy to know the peace of God.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.220
We are commanded to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.520
We find that the initial greeting of the Lord Jesus Christ, our risen Savior, as He appears

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.720
there in that place, He says, Peace be unto you.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:22.080
We find that it then tells us of their response, but they were terrified and affrighted and

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.480
supposed that they had seen a spirit.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.440
You understand that Jesus is going to, in just a few moments, help them understand that

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.840
they've not seen a spirit, but truly they are seeing the risen Savior.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.440
His bodily resurrection from the dead.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.600
He then says, as we're considering the things that Jesus says to them, in verse number 38,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.040
He says this, Why are you troubled?

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.400
Why are you troubled?

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.520
And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.440
We know the answer.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.400
They do not provide an answer as to why they were troubled.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.200
It tells us in verse 37 that they supposed that they had seen a spirit.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.080
And we understand contextually what's going on here and why they're troubled.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.760
But I ask you this morning, why are you troubled?

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.240
What is it that's troubled you?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.560
No doubt, we're living in a time of much chaos and confusion and there are people that

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.400
are troubled.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.840
But yet Jesus says, Let not your heart be troubled.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.280
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.080
In My Father's house are many mansions.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.800
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.320
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.280
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.000
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.480
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.640
We serve the risen Savior.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.920
He lives.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.420
He's conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.000
He's alive forevermore.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.840
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.480
He'll never be defeated.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.980
He's never made a mistake.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.160
He knows where you are.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160
He knows where I am.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.600
He knows what we're dealing with and yet He's still in control of everything.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.960
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.440
Why are you troubled?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.840
The answer for these disciples may be different than the answer that you would offer this

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.760
morning, but maybe some have come this morning with a troubled heart.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.280
You're just troubled with the things in our world.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.520
You're troubled with whatever's going on.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.440
Can I say that Jesus says, Why are you troubled?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.240
Can I tell you this morning that He'll give you peace as you get close to Him and enter

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.200
into His presence?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.920
As you get into this book, He'll give you a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.280
It is an absolute joy to know the peace of God.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.540
In the midst of turmoil, chaos, and confusion, we can have peace.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.260
Some have wrongly described peace as being the absence of trouble.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.800
You know that man is going to have trouble.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.280
I just read the book of Job earlier this week.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.400
Man that is born of woman has a few days and a whole lot of trouble, amen?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.400
The reality is that we face trouble and tribulation and difficulty.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.720
We understand that.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.000
The reality is that peace is not the absence of trouble, rather peace is found in the very

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.920
presence of God Almighty.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.040
Though the storm may be raging, though all seems to be out of control, we must recognize

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.120
that our God has everything under control.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:44.320
In any moment, He can say as He stood upon that boat that day and said to those storms,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.920
the winds and the waves, peace, be still.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.480
His creation obeys Him.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.800
Listen, one day the trumpet of the Lord is going to sound and all this craziness, God's

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.840
going to show that He's in control, amen?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.600
His plan is going to be fulfilled.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.400
No one is going to overcome and conquer our risen Savior.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.520
He's victorious, amen?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520
Why are you troubled?

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.440
Do you notice what He says to the disciples?

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.440
Why?

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.440
Why are you troubled?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.360
Why are you troubled?

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.520
We find that He continues in the things that He says to the disciples, the appearance of

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.880
our risen Savior.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:35.840
Verse 39, notice what He says, Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.480
Handle me and see.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480
What's He saying?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.840
He's showing them the evidence.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.520
He has conquered sin, death, and the grave, and He's alive forevermore, the bodily resurrection

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.520
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and He says, listen, behold my hands.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
What do the hands have?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.760
The hands have the prints of the nails.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.960
Behold my feet, that it is I myself.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960
Handle me and see.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:11.400
And then notice what He says, For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.840
A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.040
And it says this in verse number 40, And as He had thus spoken, He showed them His

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.480
hands and His feet.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.000
Can you imagine being in this place?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.680
It says in verse 41, And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.320
Have ye here any meat?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.520
You know, sometimes we too are slow to believe.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520
Sometimes we're like Gideon.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.640
Lord, if you're really going to deliver me, if you're going to use me in this manner,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.440
would you let there be some due here but not here?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.440
And then God does it exactly as Gideon requested.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.440
And then Gideon says, well, I'm going to need some more help on this.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.480
Let's reverse it and let there be some due here but not there.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.120
And then God does it.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.880
See, sometimes we're slow to believe.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.500
Sometimes we need some more supporting evidence, if you will.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.780
And we find that Jesus, you know, aren't you thankful that our God is patient with

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:15.780
us?

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:24.220
Aren't you thankful that He gives us truth and He's long-suffering toward us?

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.860
And we find here in the text of Scripture not only what He said, but I consider what

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.580
He did as the Bible would say to us that it says that while they yet believed not for

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.500
joy and wondered, He said unto them, notice He says, have ye here any meat?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.900
Now what's He going to do?

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.900
Well, we find that first He showed them His hands and feet, but now in verses 42 and 43,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.020
He's going to eat before them.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.260
It says this, and they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb, and He

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.460
took it and did eat before them.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:07.100
He's giving them the evidence that it is, as He says in verse number 39, that it is

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.780
I Myself.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:19.060
He's proving to them with more than sufficient evidence that He is the risen Savior.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:25.300
We find that here as we would couple Luke's account and look at what the Bible would tell

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.100
us, and you don't need to turn there, but in Acts chapter number 1, we find that Luke

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.980
uses this terminology in verse number 3, to whom also He showed Himself alive after

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.440
His passion.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.980
Notice this phraseology, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days and

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.320
speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.780
He gave them many infallible proofs, and as we look here in Luke's gospel and Luke's account,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.420
we consider what He said, and we consider what He did.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.140
We notice and we take note of the appearance of our risen Savior as we continue through

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.380
the passage of Scripture.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.940
I want you to notice the assignment given in verses 44 through 49.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.240
As we look at the assignment given, we find that first, before the Lord Jesus Christ will

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.700
explain the assignment, we find that He initially is going to remind them of what He had previously

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.100
taught, notice with me in verse number 44, and He said unto them, These are the words

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:30.340
which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:36.559
were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me.

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:41.700
You read through the Old Testament and you read about the prophecies concerning not only

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:48.540
the coming of Messiah, but you read the prophecies with regard to the crucifixion of Messiah.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.260
You read the prophecies not only of the crucifixion of Messiah, but you read the prophecies of

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.260
the resurrection of Messiah.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.020
Remember, it's there in the book of Psalms, and He references there to the Psalms.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.300
in this particular passage of Scripture, but we're finding the truth according to

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.780
Psalm 2 in verse number 7, I will declare the decree, the Lord hath said

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:17.740
unto me, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. You understand that he's

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.260
speaking of the resurrection there in Psalm 2. He's not speaking of the

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.740
first coming, the incarnation, he's speaking of the resurrection, and the

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.820
reason that we understand that and know that is as we compare Scripture with

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.460
Scripture, the Bible tells us in Acts chapter number 13, as the preaching of

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.980
the Word of God is going forth and Paul is preaching, what a great opportunity he

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.780
has. He says this with regard, it's right in the middle of his message, but in Acts

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.740
13 and verse 28, and though they found no cause of death in him, speaking of Jesus

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.700
the Messiah, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.660
fulfilled all that was written of him, there you see that again, the fulfillment

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.500
of all those things that were written in the Old Testament, they took him down

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.700
from the tree and laid him in a sepulcher. But God raised him from the

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.780
dead, and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.260
Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:22.900
tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:30.900
the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again, as it is

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:37.180
also written in the second Psalm, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.060
By the way, those fellows there in Acts chapter 13, they got a

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.460
whole lot more than they bargained for when they gave Paul the opportunity to

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.420
preach. And he went ahead and just delivered a message, they said, if you

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.540
have anything to say, say on. And he said, all right, let's go, amen, and what a

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:59.140
blessing. And he gave the gospel, and he spoke about these proofs, these

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
fulfillments of these Old Testament prophecies, and we find that Jesus is

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.300
reminding them, the disciples back in Luke chapter number 24, in verses 44 and

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.460
45, he's reminding them of these things that he had previously taught. It says in

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.740
verse number 45, then opened he their understanding that they might understand

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:26.980
the Scriptures. Isn't that a blessing, to understand the Word of God? It's God's

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.140
Word, and he can open our understanding. We speak about illumining the Scriptures,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.420
and we speak about the truth of Psalm 119, in verse 18, open down mine eyes that

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.500
I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. The entrance of thy words giveth

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.260
light, and what a joy to understand the Scriptures, the Word of God, and here we

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.900
find that Jesus, the risen Savior, he's reminding them of what he had

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.500
previously taught. Then he's going to explain to them what was

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.860
accomplished through his death, burial, and glorious resurrection. Notice with me

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:12.980
in verse number 46, he said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behooved

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.220
Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day. What was accomplished?

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.780
What was the purpose? We understand, as we studied last Sunday morning from 1st

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.940
Timothy, that the Bible says this is a faithful saying and

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.740
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:38.480
sinners, of whom I am chief, and we spoke about the fact that Jesus was going to

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.520
save sinners. How was he going to do that? Through his death, burial, and

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.440
resurrection. You understand that if he just died and was buried but did not

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.240
arise, that he would not. It's evidence, the resurrection is evidence of the

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.280
acceptance of the payment that was made on the cross of Calvary. And we find

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.320
here that he did rise, and so you notice that he says it was written and it

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.720
behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day. Why? Notice

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:14.480
verse 47, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:24.600
his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem. The reality is that as the

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.440
Lord Jesus Christ is giving this assignment, before he gets to the details

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.200
of the assignment, we find that he reminds them of what he had taught, but

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.080
then he explains to them what was accomplished at Calvary and the

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.000
resurrection. What was it that was accomplished? Well, now we find that it is

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.600
finished as John would record when Jesus, before he took his final breath, he

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:56.520
declared, it is finished. We find here that he says that repentance and

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.680
remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.680
Jerusalem. We now have this story, the fulfillment of all of these Old

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.840
Testament prophets. You think about the amazing nature of all that has

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.600
happened with regard to the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, and

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.920
you consider with me the way that the Old Testament saints, by faith, would look

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.800
forward to the day that Messiah would come and to the Messiah going and

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.440
being our Passover. All of those offerings that they would offer and the

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.440
priests that would daily stand and minister and offering those same

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.760
offerings day by day, year by year, that could never take away sin, but it was a

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.440
picture of Messiah who would now come, and now as Jesus is proclaiming and

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.240
sharing with these disciples and with us what was accomplished, it's been paid for,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:02.760
it's done, it's over, I have finished the work. Now go preach repentance of sins,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.400
remission of sins, and what a joy and what a blessing. Aren't you thankful this

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.800
morning that you can declare that God loves individuals and that you can

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.040
declare that Jesus saves? They played this morning, we sang some wonderful hymns

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.840
this morning, but the song that they played for the offertory was what? It was

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.880
Jesus saves. And I'm so thankful for that declaration, and we can shout it out

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.040
and we can share it with individuals. Why? Because of what he did on the cross of

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.600
Calvary and what was accomplished. I'm so thankful that God, I was

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.360
praying this week and as I was just meditating upon all that he's done for

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.240
me and all that he is to me and just being a wonderful Savior, I was mindful

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:54.160
this week about the truth of only one way of salvation. I was reminded and I

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.160
was thankful, and I thank the Lord for this specifically, I was thankful that in

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.000
his wisdom that he did not determine that we could get to heaven by our own

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
works. He could have determined that. And then how would we ever know if we ever

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.640
did enough? How would we ever know? How could we ever have peace? How could we

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.040
ever have joy? How could we know when we royally messed it up how many good

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.680
things it just wiped out? You understand what I mean? Y'all ever have a bad day?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.440
We watched Fireproof last night. How many of you have ever seen Fireproof? It's a good

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.960
movie. Oh, Caleb out there, I don't know what is Mr., what's his name? The Neighbor.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.880
Mr. Rudolph. How many of y'all seen that movie, man? Mr. Rudolph was out there and

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.240
he's standing there and Caleb's beating that trash can, man, he had a bad day, you

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.680
know what I mean? And he says, Mr. Rudolph, and he says, Caleb, and then he tells

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:55.080
his wife, don't talk to that guy, you know? But he had a bad day. I'm so thankful it's

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:01.880
not about my own works. Man, what a terrible way it would be to live, not

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:08.560
knowing day by day, have I done enough? How could I ever know? Oh, I was thanking

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:17.480
Him this week that that's not the way of salvation because we'd never know. I was

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.840
thanking Him this morning that it's not just a pick-your-own-way and all roads lead

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:36.119
to. No. The truth of God's Word is that Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:44.440
No man cometh unto the Father but by me. Peter stood in Acts chapter number four after

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.760
that great miracle in Acts chapter number three of that lame man that was healed. Oh,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.000
how it caused a stir there in Jerusalem. He says, if we're called in question this day

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.600
of these things that have happened, I want you to know that by the name of Jesus Christ

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.360
of Nazareth, this man was made whole. It wasn't in Peter's power. It wasn't in John's power.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.960
It was in the power of our resurrected Savior. Peter said, neither is there salvation in

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:17.160
any other. For there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:29.520
saved. And that God, in His infinite wisdom, devised a plan for redemption requiring the

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:38.400
blood sacrifice, and Jesus paid it all. Oh, how it's rejoicing to just be mindful of

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:45.280
that wonderful truth that we hold dear, that we are privileged to receive. And so Jesus

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:54.320
is explaining to them what was accomplished. Why did Jesus have to go to the cross? Because

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.760
there's no other way for a man to be redeemed. Why did He have to suffer such a horrific

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.040
death?

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:09.760
because he loves you and he paid for your sin we've been bought with a price

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.520
oh he says this is what was accomplished notice he finally will explain their

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.800
assignment notice with me in verse 48 it says and ye are witnesses of these

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.880
things oh he puts the responsibility right on him doesn't he I mean square on

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.400
their shoulders I want you to understand what I've accomplished I want you to

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.400
understand what has been accomplished in these days and paying for the sin of

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.760
mankind that now repentance and remission of sin should be preached to

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.480
all people to all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:52.400
things I'm thankful that not only did he tell them that they were witnesses of

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.960
these things but they he told them that they would be empowered by God the Holy

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.880
Spirit notice in verse 49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.920
but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.480
high we don't do the work of God our own power we go on the power of the Holy

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:22.760
Spirit of God we have the promise that Jesus said I am with you and we have the

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.880
promise there in Acts chapter number one in verse number eight but you shall

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.400
receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.520
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.360
part of the earth and you find here notice the the purpose the assignment if

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.040
you will in verse number 47 that repentance and remission of sins should

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:48.000
be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem how is

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.440
this monumental task going to be accomplished ye are his witnesses and we

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:01.120
go in the power of the Holy Spirit we notice the appearance of our resurrected

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:07.840
Savior I mean can you imagine it's late at night 11 are gathered I'm not sure

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:14.200
what they're discussing the Bible doesn't tell us but these two that

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.680
return from Emmaus with excitement the Lord has risen indeed and as they're

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:27.200
sharing these things Jesus himself appears he says it is me I mean look at

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.960
my hands look at my feet do you have any bread he eats and then he gives them an

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:40.040
assignment your witnesses of these things notice as we conclude the passage

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.400
of Scripture here in the book of Luke number three if you're taking notes

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:51.000
notice the ascension of our risen Savior and he in verse number 50 Jesus he led

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.200
them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:07.720
it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.640
heaven can you imagine often we read the account in Acts chapter 1 of the

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:19.640
ascension of Jesus Christ they were standing there and just before their

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.040
very eyes at the end of those 40 days after he made these appearances and all

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.920
that takes place he ascends into heaven we know as we look at the whole of

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.480
Scripture that that's where he is even at this moment the right hand of the

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.080
Father ever live ever living as the Scripture saying Hebrews 725 that he

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.360
ever liveth to make intercession for us and it just the exact time he's coming

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.880
back for us what a blessed truth and we find that these disciples I mean think

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:57.160
about all that has happened and now the the Lord is is going to ascend back up

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:04.040
into heaven and the Bible says remember he said I go to my father it says that

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.240
they worshipped him and look at how they returned to Jerusalem in verse number 52

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:17.760
with great joy with great joy listen as we leave here in just a little while as

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.520
we go on our journey that we call life we ought to have great joy why because

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.040
we serve a risen Savior why because he's ascended to heaven and he's living to

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.080
make intercession for us why because one day he's coming back for me it is the

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.720
hope of every believer that we would see him face to face as I mentioned in our

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.000
outdoor service this morning hope is not some wishful thinking pie in the sky

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:48.320
hope is based upon truth that God has given us it is confidence based upon a

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:56.240
promise from God's Word that's hope that's Bible hope amen we have great

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.560
hope we ought to have great joy I mean listen there ought to be something

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.320
noticeably different about us in our behavior our actions and how we interact

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.600
with the things are going on in life why are you so different why does this not

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.640
cause you to be depressed and down and troubled man because my eyes are on

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:23.200
Jesus and he lives he's coming back for me people gonna think you're crazy man

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:31.080
and that's okay because they're gonna want some of what you have amen we find

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.560
in verse number 53 they return to Jerusalem with great joy according verse

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.640
52 and verse 53 and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing God

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.000
amen I want you to think just for a moment as we wrap up this morning I

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.080
want you to think about not only the importance of the Ascension of Jesus

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.000
Christ we see that record here but I want you to think about the impact of

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.680
all of these events not only the the appearance of our Lord and Savior the

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.280
assignment the Ascension I want you to think about the early church and we

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.720
don't have time this morning to really review much of the book of Acts but just

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.080
by way of brief overview you understand that these disciples they embrace the

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.080
assignment they embraced it it's interesting it's not recorded here in

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.120
in Luke's account but in Acts 1 the Bible tells us that those angels that

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:32.280
stood by as as Jesus was ascended up into heaven that that those disciples it

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.760
tells us in in Acts Luke also is the human penman of this book and we find

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.120
the Bible tells us in verse number 10 and that they look steadfastly toward

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.800
heaven I mean he was he was ascended in verse number 9 and when he had spoken

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.440
these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.080
their sight in verse 10 while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he

00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.640
went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:11.000
of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus know what it

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.040
says this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven notice shall so

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.960
come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:33.040
oh man I think the impact upon these disciples as you see they tarried in

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.760
Jerusalem as Jesus had told him and then they were endued with power from on high

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:44.880
and you find that they turned the world upside down why I believe that they

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.960
believe that Jesus was coming amen I mean it motivated them to service it

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.840
caught listen they loved the Lord and they had embraced the assignment and they

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.880
had heard from the angels that this same Jesus is coming back he didn't give

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.120
him a time and we know now that nearly 2,000 years has passed but doesn't make

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:14.720
the promise any less of a promise in fact we're a day closer every day amen I

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.640
don't know the day no man knoweth the day nor the hour so what the Word of God

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:27.720
says but man he's coming work for the night is coming oh we embrace the

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:34.800
promise we embrace the assignment I hope this morning as we celebrate Easter we

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.480
celebrate the resurrection we look at this account in Luke chapter number 24

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:45.560
that we can allow in our sanctified imaginations to see that setting of

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.680
those disciples gathered together the news that they had received in the

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:56.920
appearance of our risen Savior the assignment that was given later on his

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:06.600
ascension that we would have great joy knowing that we serve a risen Savior

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:13.240
there's no problem that you will ever encounter that's too big for God no

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.640
nothing I'm not saying that there's not gonna problem that you're gonna

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.360
encounter and by the way the problem might be too big for you but that's a

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.760
good thing amen you ever been in place we say I don't know what to do

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:33.280
everybody's been there except for God amen I look at this I mean I don't know

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:39.760
what to do I need wisdom we serve a risen Savior there's no problem there

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.480
might be problems too hard for me too hard for you there's no problem too

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:51.200
hard for God oh that we'd have joy that we would truly allow the the reality of

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.680
the resurrection to influence and impact our lives that we would live with a

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.240
certain level of excitement

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:08.840
joy and peace, because we serve a risen Savior, and we know that He's coming again. Amen?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:15.640
The Lord Himself stood in the midst of them, and one day, one glorious day,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.160
we shall see Him face to face. Let us pray. Father, we love You this morning.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.720
Oh, how we thank You for loving us. How we thank You for Your Word.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.160
No doubt in my mind that those that are gathered here this morning

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.120
believe that You have risen from the dead, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.520
Perhaps there's one, whether here or on livestream,

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.640
that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.680
They've never accepted the free gift of eternal life.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.600
Maybe today, Lord, we pray that it would be the day of salvation for that individual.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.840
The Holy Spirit of God would convince them of their sin,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:15.000
of Christ's righteousness, and of judgment to come. Lord, maybe there's one, maybe there's many

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:22.840
gathered here locally, tuned in via livestream, that are troubled.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:32.440
Many things in our world seek to trouble.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:42.040
We know that even the people of God can be impacted adversely. Jesus said,

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:50.920
why are you troubled? He said, before He would ever go to that cross, let not your heart be troubled.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.480
Oh, God, I pray that You'd give us a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.280
I pray, God, that You would help us to embrace the assignment even as the disciples did.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.920
Oh, that it would be said of us that we have filled this place with the gospel.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.920
It's what they said of the disciples, you filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:22.440
Oh, that they'd say that you filled Oakton and Vienna and Fairfax with your doctrine.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:30.680
How glorious that would be. Lord, I pray that You'd empower us and that You would use us,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.920
help us to have joy, peace, and hope. We pray that You'd move and work as only You can,

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.680
for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.840
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar is open. You can make

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.120
your pew and altar. You can come up here to this altar. Why don't you thank God?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:59.240
Why don't you ask God to use you as we have this moment of invitation this morning?
