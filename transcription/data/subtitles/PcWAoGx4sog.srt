1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
number 27 this evening, Genesis chapter number 27.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,559
And last week, I preached a message

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,760
dealing with, from the book of Romans,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,680
really missions and the Great Commission, if you will.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,800
And we watched some update videos.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,840
So it's been a couple of weeks

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,360
since we've been in the book of Genesis,

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,479
but last time we were in Genesis chapter number 26.

9
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,360
And at the end of the passage,

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,700
after we trace the life of the events there of Isaac's life

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,340
and the time that he spent in Gerar,

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,740
we found that, of course, Esau was married

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,900
at the end of the passage and he was 40 years old.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,599
And that made Isaac 100 years old.

15
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:42,099
We know that the word of God tells us

16
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,540
at the end of chapter 25 that when they were born,

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,099
that he was 60.

18
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,700
And so therefore, we see that Isaac

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,860
would have been 100 years old at this particular time

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,380
at the close of Genesis 26.

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,500
As we enter into Genesis chapter number 27,

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,799
as best we can tell, somewhere between 30 and 40 years

23
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,699
have passed from the events in Genesis 26

24
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,940
until entering Genesis 27, 30 to 40 years.

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,260
If you really wanna nail it down,

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,199
it seems to be right around 37 years

27
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,099
that have passed between the end of chapter 26

28
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,099
and the beginning of chapter 27.

29
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,379
We find that at that particular time, of course,

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,580
it would make Isaac about 137 years old,

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,720
if it is right there at 37 years.

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,839
But he's somewhere between 130 and 140.

33
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,000
And the Bible tells us, beginning in verse number one,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,680
and it came to pass that when Isaac was old,

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,559
and the Bible says that his eyes were dim

36
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,059
so that he could not see, that he called Esau,

37
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,639
his eldest son, and said unto him, my son.

38
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,440
And he said unto him, behold, here am I.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,160
There's a great truth that is revealed to us

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,139
in verse number two.

41
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,760
The Bible says that he, Isaac, says to his son Esau,

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,959
behold, now I am old.

43
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,639
Notice when he says, I know not the day of my death.

44
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,360
You know, the reality is that that statement is true

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,800
for every single one of us.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,639
I know not the day of my death.

47
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,440
It does not have to be that we're old.

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,020
It does not have to be that our eyesight is failing us.

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,039
If you look at the truth of what we find

50
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,960
in the book of Genesis, you'll find that Ishmael died

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,080
at 137 years old.

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,360
So if Isaac is exactly 137, coupled with the fact

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
that his eyesight has gone bad,

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,160
perhaps he's really thinking, I'm gonna die.

55
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,360
But the reality is that, as David said,

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,080
and I understand that David said this

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,440
because of him being hunted by Saul,

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,679
he made this statement,

59
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,139
there's but a step between me and death.

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,600
That's true for every one of us.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,779
Every single one of us, there's a step between me and death.

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,979
The Bible tells us that our life is but a vapor

63
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,139
that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.

64
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,460
We're not to boast ourselves of tomorrow

65
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,179
for we know not what a day would bring forth.

66
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,259
And we have these biblical truths,

67
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,100
these instructions, we're told to number our days,

68
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,740
and we find here that there's a great truth

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,179
in this statement, and how important it is

70
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:15,259
that we would be prepared for the day of our departure.

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,179
Paul was able to say, the time of my departure's at hand.

72
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,259
You know, we don't all have that privilege

73
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,580
of being able to know that the day of our departure's

74
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,960
at hand, to know that we've come to those final days

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,220
or moments of our life.

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,139
There are people that tragically die

77
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,619
in an instant every single day.

78
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,380
People that get up and they plan to go to the workplace,

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,460
and they plan to come home,

80
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,179
and they plan that everything's gonna go right,

81
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,600
and there's a fatal accident.

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,479
It happens all the time.

83
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,479
Brevity, the brevity of life,

84
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,240
and we see that in verse number two.

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,759
Obviously, that's not the entirety

86
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,160
of the passage this evening,

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,559
and you look at the whole of this chapter

88
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,639
that we're gonna study this evening.

89
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,800
It is interesting to note, however,

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,360
when you think about this statement of Isaac,

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
I know not the day of my death,

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,759
that in fact, he lives to be 180 years old.

93
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,759
Genesis 35 records for us that he was 180 when he dies,

94
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,399
and when you think about that,

95
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,239
that means that there were about 43 years

96
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,480
that he lived after he made this statement,

97
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,839
after the events that are recorded

98
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,720
here in Genesis chapter 27.

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,920
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,320
when Isaac calls Esau, he calls him in verse number one,

101
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,200
he tells him that he knows not the day of his death,

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,880
and really, the purpose, if you will,

103
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,559
for calling Esau is revealed to us in verse number four.

104
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,480
We'll use it as our title this evening.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,980
The Bible says, and make me savory meat such as I love,

106
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,519
and bring it to me that I may eat,

107
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,119
that my soul may bless thee before I die.

108
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,600
I've titled the message this evening

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,119
that my soul may bless thee.

110
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,359
In a previous message, I think it was a few weeks ago,

111
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,000
I mentioned about this family

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,399
that they're a dysfunctional family,

113
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,760
and I made that statement about this family,

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,040
and I said that we find that still today in our society

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,679
that the home family is under attack,

116
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,799
and unfortunately, there are many families

117
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,760
that are dysfunctional.

118
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,279
I find that that truth, that reality is on full display

119
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,720
in Genesis chapter 27.

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
The dysfunction of this family is on full display,

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,440
and God Almighty has recorded these events

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
for all of humanity to be able to read.

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,679
And as we look at this passage of Scripture,

124
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,440
I would say this right at the beginning,

125
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,399
that my heart is saddened by the carnality

126
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,700
and the deception that dominates this chapter.

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,480
The carnality and the deception

128
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,559
that dominates Genesis chapter 27.

129
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,799
And the reality is that there's a danger

130
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:04,799
for each and every one of us to live a life of carnality,

131
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,239
to give in to the temptation to deceive,

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,559
to scheme, and to take matters in our own hands.

133
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,000
And there's a temptation that each of us face,

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
and oh, how we need to trust the Lord

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,880
and allow God to be the sovereign God that He is,

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,959
and to work in and through our lives as only He can.

137
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,559
He can do much better than you can do.

138
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,480
You believe that tonight?

139
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,679
I believe that.

140
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,519
I believe that He's able to do in my life

141
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,079
and in my circumstances,

142
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,399
in my days of trouble and difficulty,

143
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,679
He's able to take care of it a whole lot better than I am.

144
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,119
But sometimes we wanna get our hand involved,

145
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,799
and we think we can figure it out.

146
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,799
We think we can come up with a solution.

147
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,480
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

148
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
I wanna share three thoughts this evening.

149
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,799
Notice with me, number one, the instruction given.

150
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:04,040
The instruction that is given first is from Isaac to Esau.

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,880
We see it in the beginning verses.

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,140
We've read some of them already.

153
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,239
Notice that he says, behold, in verse number two,

154
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,600
now I am old, I know not the day of my death.

155
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,799
Notice the instruction begins from Isaac to Esau

156
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,920
in verse number three.

157
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,720
He says, now therefore take, I pray thee,

158
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,320
thy weapons, thy quiver, and thy bow,

159
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,440
and go out to the field and take me some venison.

160
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,480
Notice what he says, and make me savory meat,

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,739
such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat,

162
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,559
that my soul may bless thee before I die.

163
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:39,079
As I think about the instruction that is being given,

164
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,059
and I think about the perspective of Isaac,

165
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:46,959
I really would say that Isaac is operating on carnal ground.

166
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,440
Isaac is operating in this situation

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,519
where he is looking for, in these last moments,

168
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,559
think about it, he's gonna live for 43 more years.

169
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,320
We have the whole of scripture that we can read that,

170
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,779
but he thinks his time of departure is at hand.

171
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,320
And what's the number one thing he's concerned about

172
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,799
is go get me some meat that I can eat it

173
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,179
and enjoy this meat that I love.

174
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,640
Think about that for just a moment.

175
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,959
When you look at other patriarchs

176
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,820
and other heroes of the faith throughout the word of God,

177
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,320
in their final moments on this earth,

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,239
they take and they seek to impart

179
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,959
some great level of truth to those

180
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,040
that are coming behind them.

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,239
And Isaac is concerned about his last meal.

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
And then he adds on it that I may bless thee,

183
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,659
that my soul may bless thee before I die.

184
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,320
Let me ask this question.

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,559
Was it Esau's blessing that he was to receive?

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,940
God had already communicated, if you remember in our study

187
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,179
back in Genesis chapter number 25,

188
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,979
in verse number 23, the Bible said,

189
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,260
and the Lord said unto her, remember,

190
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,820
she inquired of the Lord, why?

191
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,099
Because of the struggle that was within her.

192
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:03,419
And she inquires of the Lord, and the Lord says to Rebekah,

193
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,099
two nations are in thy womb,

194
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,940
and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels.

195
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,900
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people.

196
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,179
And the elder, the elder, that's Esau,

197
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,940
the elder shall serve the younger.

198
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,580
That's Jacob, correct?

199
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,900
And so we find that Isaac is operating in carnality.

200
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
He's not following the plan or will of God.

201
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,559
He says, I wanna have this meat.

202
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,700
I wanna have this final meal, this meat that I love.

203
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,820
And then he says that my soul may bless thee before I die.

204
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,219
He's operating outside of the will of God,

205
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,979
but he's giving instruction to his son Esau.

206
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,059
And the Bible tells us that Esau responds.

207
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,340
As we look at the passage of scripture,

208
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,619
it says that Rebekah heard in verse number five,

209
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:53,020
when Isaac spake to Esau his son.

210
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,780
Notice what it says at the end of verse number five,

211
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,020
and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison

212
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,460
and to bring it.

213
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,219
Esau responded to the instruction.

214
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:03,219
Dad said to go out and get this venison and bring it back

215
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,219
and make it and bring it to me for this final meal.

216
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,219
And the Bible says that Esau does that,

217
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:11,219
that he goes out to the field to hunt for venison

218
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,219
and to bring it.

219
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:16,219
I believe that as you look at the life of Esau,

220
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,219
we've mentioned it in previous messages.

221
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,219
We mentioned it in chapter 25.

222
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,219
At the end of chapter number 26, I'll mention again this evening,

223
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:26,219
and you'll see that at the end of the passage in particular,

224
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,219
Hebrews 13 deals with it as well,

225
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:32,219
that Esau is really mainly concerned for temporal things.

226
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,219
He's minding earthly things.

227
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,219
Why is it that Esau so desperately wants a blessing?

228
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:42,219
He wants the blessing of temporal things.

229
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:46,219
He wants the land, he wants the goods, he wants the plenty.

230
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,219
We find that Esau receives the instruction

231
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:53,219
and he departs to fulfill that which had been given him.

232
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,219
We find that in verses 6-17,

233
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,219
that it's now Rebekah who will instruct Jacob.

234
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:01,219
Now remember, we've read before

235
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:04,219
how that Esau was loved by Isaac

236
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,219
and Jacob was loved by Rebekah.

237
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,219
I mentioned about the dysfunction in the family.

238
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,219
And now Rebekah's going to instruct Jacob.

239
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,219
Notice it tells us in verse number 5

240
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,219
that Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son.

241
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:19,219
So Rebekah's listening in

242
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,219
and she hears what Esau is told to do

243
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:24,219
and so now she's going to jump in

244
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,219
and she's going to come up with this plan

245
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,219
and she's going to give instruction to Jacob.

246
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,219
It says in verse 6,

247
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:33,219
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying,

248
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:36,219
Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy brother,

249
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:38,219
saying, Bring me venison, and make me savory meat,

250
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:42,219
that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.

251
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,219
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice,

252
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,219
according to that which I command thee.

253
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:49,219
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from fence

254
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,219
two good kids of the goats,

255
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:54,219
and I will make them savory meat for thy father,

256
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:56,219
such as he loveth.

257
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,219
And thou shalt bring it to thy father,

258
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:02,219
that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

259
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,219
So we see the plan of Rebekah.

260
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:07,219
She is now giving this instruction to Jacob

261
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:09,219
and we find that Jacob is no doubt

262
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:12,219
understanding the instruction that's been given

263
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:15,219
and he offers an objection in verses 11 and 12.

264
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,219
It's interesting, however,

265
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:20,219
why he's making the objection to this plan.

266
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:23,219
Notice in verse number 11 that Jacob said to Rebekah,

267
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:28,219
his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man,

268
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,219
and I am a smooth man.

269
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,219
This is going to be a problem.

270
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,219
But notice what he says in verse number 12.

271
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:38,219
My father peradventure will feel me,

272
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:39,219
notice what he says,

273
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:45,219
and I shall seem to him as a deceiver.

274
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:48,219
If you're going in and doing what this plan is,

275
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,219
you are a deceiver.

276
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,219
Amen?

277
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,219
It's not just that you appear to be a deceiver.

278
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,219
He says this,

279
00:12:56,219 --> 00:13:01,219
and I shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing.

280
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,219
Here's an interesting note.

281
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:04,219
Jacob's objection,

282
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:09,219
he was not concerned with whether the plan was right.

283
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:13,219
He was concerned on whether the plan was safe.

284
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:17,219
Isn't that sad?

285
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:20,219
There's no objection to the plan

286
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:25,219
on the merit of the plan being honorable and appropriate

287
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:28,219
and the plan being God honoring.

288
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:30,219
There's objection on the part of

289
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:34,219
I'm going to appear to be a deceiver.

290
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:37,219
It's unbelievable.

291
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,219
And we look and we find what's happening

292
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,219
and we find that to this objection

293
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,219
that Rebekah will respond.

294
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,219
And notice in verse 13,

295
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:47,219
his mother said unto him,

296
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:50,219
Upon me be thy curse, my son.

297
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:53,219
Only obey my voice and go fetch me them.

298
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,219
I want you to remember verse 13.

299
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,219
We'll come back to it at the end of the message,

300
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,219
but very interesting what Rebekah says here

301
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:05,219
as it all unfolds how tragic these words become.

302
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,219
In verse 14 it says,

303
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:09,219
And he, this is now Jacob,

304
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,219
he went and he fetched

305
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,219
and he brought them to his mother.

306
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:17,219
And his mother made savory meat such as his father loved.

307
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,219
And Rebekah took goodly garment,

308
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:22,219
raiment, excuse me, of her eldest son Esau,

309
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,219
which were with her in the house

310
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,219
and put them upon Jacob, her younger son.

311
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,219
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats

312
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,219
upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck.

313
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,219
She gave the savory meat and the bread

314
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:37,219
which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.

315
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:40,219
You think about the elaborate plan that is devised

316
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:43,219
and how that they took all of the steps

317
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:46,219
that they thought they could take

318
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:51,219
in order to deceive Isaac.

319
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,219
Esau's hairy and you're not.

320
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:56,219
We got a solution for that.

321
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,219
Isn't that sad?

322
00:14:57,219 --> 00:15:00,219
And really when you see the instruction that's given

323
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,219
and you look at what's taking place,

324
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,219
again, as I mentioned, yes, it's true

325
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,219
that the instruction from Isaac to Esau

326
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,219
is carnal instruction

327
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,219
and it's not following the plan of God.

328
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,219
We find though, however, that as Rebekah

329
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,219
is instructing Jacob that once again

330
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:19,219
there's this dealing with problems

331
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,219
and issues in life and trying to scheme

332
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:25,219
and devise solutions in our own will

333
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,219
and our own power.

334
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,219
We find that this instruction is given

335
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,219
and the plan is carried out.

336
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:34,219
The Bible now leaves us in verse 17

337
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:37,219
where Jacob is now fully prepared.

338
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,219
He's got the garment on.

339
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:42,219
He's got the skins put upon him.

340
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,219
He's got that savory meat in his hand

341
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:48,219
and he's now going to go into his father.

342
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,219
We find the interaction if you're taking notes

343
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:54,219
in verse 18-40, the interaction recorded.

344
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,219
I want you to notice first of all

345
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,219
the interaction between Isaac and Jacob.

346
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,219
It begins in verse 18.

347
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:03,219
Notice the extent of deception

348
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:06,219
that we find in these first few verses

349
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:09,219
and he, Jacob, came unto his father

350
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,219
and said, my father.

351
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,219
And he said, hear my.

352
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:17,219
Who art thou, my son?

353
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,219
It's interesting because later on

354
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:22,219
he would speak about the voice

355
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:25,219
and he says, who art thou, my son?

356
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,219
He says, Jacob said unto his father.

357
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,219
Notice the deception.

358
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,219
It begins right away.

359
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:32,219
Let me make this statement.

360
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:35,219
One lie leads to more lies.

361
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:37,219
Your mom ever tell you that when you were a kid?

362
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,219
I remember hearing that when I was a kid.

363
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:42,219
They talk about the web of lies

364
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:44,219
and being caught in the trap

365
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,219
and you don't remember all the things

366
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:49,219
and how you've got to keep making all of these.

367
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,219
That's what happens in this passage.

368
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,219
He says, notice what Jacob said unto his father.

369
00:16:55,219 --> 00:17:01,219
Number one, I am Esau, thy firstborn.

370
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:05,219
You're not.

371
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:07,219
You're lying.

372
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:10,219
By the way, how does God feel about lying?

373
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,219
What does the Bible tell us

374
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,219
about what God feels about lying?

375
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,219
He hates it.

376
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,219
You know in the seven things that God hates

377
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:22,219
that lying is twice in the list?

378
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:24,219
One of the Ten Commandments,

379
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,219
thou shalt not bear false witness.

380
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:29,219
Is that not what the Word of God says?

381
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,219
And so we find that he says,

382
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,219
I am Esau, thy firstborn.

383
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:40,219
Notice, I have done according as thou badest me.

384
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:43,219
First of all, he didn't bade you to do anything.

385
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,219
Correct?

386
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:51,219
Jacob did not receive any instruction from Isaac.

387
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:54,219
But he says, I have done according as thou badest me.

388
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,219
Arise, I pray thee.

389
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:59,219
Sit and eat of my venison.

390
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,219
Is it venison?

391
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:06,219
It's not even venison!

392
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:11,219
That thy soul may bless me.

393
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:13,219
And Isaac said unto his son,

394
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:16,219
this is terrible. It's tragic.

395
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,219
Honestly.

396
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,219
It's really on the edge of being blasphemous.

397
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:24,219
In verse 20, Isaac says unto his son,

398
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,219
he says, how is it that thou hast

399
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:31,219
found it so quickly, my son?

400
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:34,219
And he said, because the Lord thy God

401
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:39,219
brought it to me.

402
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:43,219
Now, he's gone to the level

403
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:48,219
of saying God has provided.

404
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:54,219
He's bringing God into his deceptive plan.

405
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,219
We never do that.

406
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,219
Be careful.

407
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:01,219
Because it's within every single one of us

408
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,219
to scheme and to devise

409
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:06,219
and to lean on our own understanding

410
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:09,219
and to rely on deception and whatever

411
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:13,219
and how far do we go?

412
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,219
It's tragic.

413
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:18,219
My heart is saddened at Genesis 27.

414
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,219
I said it in Sunday school this morning.

415
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,219
I told Holland, I was driving with her yesterday.

416
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,219
I said, this chapter, there's not a whole lot

417
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,219
of good in this chapter.

418
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,219
Everyone seems to be operating in the flesh

419
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:34,219
and the deception and the carnality, it's sad.

420
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,219
I would think that it's a passage of Scripture

421
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:40,219
that had they known that it would be recorded

422
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:43,219
for all of human history,

423
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:50,219
perhaps they would have operated in a different way.

424
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:53,219
Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.

425
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,219
How sad.

426
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:59,219
Verse 21, the Bible says that Isaac,

427
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,919
and Isaac said unto Jacob,

428
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,119
come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son,

429
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,099
whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

430
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:08,799
Now remember his eyes, right?

431
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,599
We found that in verse number one.

432
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,959
Remember he said that his eyes were dim

433
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,999
and this is what was one of those factors

434
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,399
that led to him feeling that his day of departure,

435
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,159
his day of death was soon.

436
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,399
Jacob went near unto his father and he felt him.

437
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,179
So what did he feel when he felt him?

438
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,239
Well, remember they devised that plan.

439
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,359
She put the skins of the kids of the goats

440
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,359
upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck

441
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,039
according to verse number 16.

442
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,639
So it says that he touches them.

443
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,559
It says that whether they'll be my son

444
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,399
and Jacob, verse 22, went near unto Isaac, his father,

445
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:45,679
and he felt him and said, the voice is Jacob's voice.

446
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,439
The hands.

447
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,399
Well, the hands were the hands of Esau.

448
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,119
Verse 23, and he discerned him not

449
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,639
because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands,

450
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,359
so he blessed him.

451
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,799
And he said, notice again, notice what Isaac says,

452
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,779
art thou my very son Esau?

453
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,379
And he said, I am.

454
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,039
I mean, at this point, we can study human history,

455
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,279
we can study the behavior of humans.

456
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,579
There comes a point where you go so far

457
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,479
that you just dig in and you just continue with your story.

458
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,159
No matter how far the trap has gone,

459
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,919
no matter how, he's digging in.

460
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:30,999
I am.

461
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,959
No, you're not.

462
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,919
Verse 25, he said, bring it near to me

463
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,359
and I will eat of my son's venison

464
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,399
that my soul may bless thee.

465
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,079
And he brought it near to him and he did eat

466
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,799
and he brought him wine and he drank

467
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,159
and his father Isaac said unto him,

468
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,559
come near now and kiss me, my son.

469
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,839
And he came near and kissed him

470
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,639
and he smelled the smell of his raiment.

471
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,319
Whose raiment was that, by the way?

472
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,559
It's not Jacob's raiment, it's Esau's.

473
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,359
Remember, it says in verse 15,

474
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,039
and Rebecca took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau,

475
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
which were with her in the house,

476
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,479
and put them upon Jacob, her younger son.

477
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,919
And so he smells the raiment and blessed him and said,

478
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,919
see, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field

479
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,699
which the Lord hath blessed.

480
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,279
The blessing is given.

481
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,439
In verses 28 and 29, you find that the Bible says,

482
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:19,519
therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven

483
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,079
and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine.

484
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,959
Let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee.

485
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,479
Be Lord over thy brethren

486
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,799
and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee.

487
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,719
Cursed be everyone that curseth thee

488
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,919
and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

489
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,079
You notice that the last part of verse number 29,

490
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,299
really he's invoking the blessing that God gave to Abraham,

491
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,799
which would properly be sent down to Jacob,

492
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,319
but of course through all that's taking place here

493
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,119
in the deception, but he's giving this blessing.

494
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,079
In verses 28 and 29.

495
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,839
Now, before we move on,

496
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,679
I'd like to just make a couple of comments.

497
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,199
I've made these comments in previous messages,

498
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:00,039
one with regard to Abraham and Sarah's interaction

499
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,839
and how that Abraham lied and said that Sarah was his sister

500
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,479
and then we made the comment

501
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,039
when we looked at Isaac and Rebekah

502
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,319
and said that Isaac lied and said Rebekah was his sister.

503
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,679
And I believe that as we look at this passage of scripture,

504
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,139
as much as Isaac is planning to do the wrong thing,

505
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:20,619
he's opposing the will of God

506
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:23,059
that's already been revealed in Genesis chapter 25

507
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:27,919
with regard to the blessing that it still did not require

508
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,919
that Rebekah and Jacob scheme and dip down to the level

509
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,079
in which they came to in this passage of scripture.

510
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,419
What if, and I know it's a hypothetical,

511
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,459
I know that we cannot say with definitive answer

512
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,699
in this particular case,

513
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:53,699
but what if Rebekah and Jacob, aware of the plan of Isaac,

514
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,459
had sought the Lord in prayer and asked God to intervene?

515
00:23:58,459 --> 00:23:59,979
Is God able to intervene?

516
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:06,459
Could God not keep Esau from finding any deer to kill?

517
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,939
As much as the Lord Jesus Christ

518
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,619
brought all the fish into the net,

519
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,459
he could have driven all the deer out of the woods.

520
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:16,979
Amen, I believe that.

521
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,379
And the reality is that God is able.

522
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,659
God could have prevented that Esau

523
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,219
ever even came back to the place.

524
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:29,219
God could have worked in the heart of Isaac

525
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,699
so that Isaac would have submitted

526
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,179
to the plan and will of God.

527
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,939
There are many things that could have happened

528
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,259
that could have brought honor and glory,

529
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:41,419
not only to God, but to this family.

530
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,259
But instead, there was scheming,

531
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,719
and there was deception, and there was carnality.

532
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,419
And it ends in tragedy.

533
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,299
Yes, the blessing is given,

534
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,219
but what tragic ending to the family

535
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,539
and all that takes place,

536
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,319
I'm thankful that in several chapters,

537
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,419
we'll read of the reunion of Jacob and Esau,

538
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,539
and what a blessing that is.

539
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:08,059
But notice here that the blessing is given

540
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,339
in verse 28 and 29, and it says in verse number 30,

541
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,419
and it came to pass,

542
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,659
as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob,

543
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:17,299
and Jacob was yet scarce gone out

544
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,479
from the presence of Isaac, his father,

545
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,979
that Esau, his brother, came in from his hunting.

546
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:27,319
The Bible tells us that Esau now enters,

547
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,699
and again, as we would think about

548
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:30,439
the interaction that's recorded,

549
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,899
we now are going to see in these next several verses

550
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,259
the interaction between Isaac and Esau,

551
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:36,939
and it begins in verse number 31,

552
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:39,139
and he also had made savory meat

553
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,479
and brought it unto his father,

554
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,319
and said unto his father,

555
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:44,139
let my father arise in need of my son's venison,

556
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:47,419
of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

557
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,219
And Isaac, his father, said unto him,

558
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:51,499
who art thou?

559
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:55,899
And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

560
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,239
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, who?

561
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:06,259
Where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me,

562
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:09,499
and I have eaten of all before thou camest,

563
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,059
and have blessed him?

564
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,059
Notice this, he says, yea, and he shall be blessed.

565
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:19,579
We don't understand, perhaps,

566
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,139
all of the nuances of the culture

567
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,179
and all that takes place with the blessing

568
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,179
and all that was wrapped up in verses 28 and 29,

569
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,939
and how this blessing was given,

570
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:34,379
but we find that Isaac, as he trembles

571
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,019
and as he sees a little bit of what's happening,

572
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,679
it's going to unfold further,

573
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,499
that he says, yea, and he shall be blessed.

574
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,279
When Esau heard the words in verse 34 of his father,

575
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,599
he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry,

576
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,839
and said unto his father, bless me, even me also,

577
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,439
O my father.

578
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,799
And he said, thy brother came with subtlety,

579
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,039
and hath taken away thy blessing.

580
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,359
And he said, is not he rightly named Jacob,

581
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,619
for he hath supplanted me these two times?

582
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,279
Notice, he took away my birthright,

583
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,239
and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.

584
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:13,719
And he said, hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

585
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,559
And Isaac answered and said unto Esau,

586
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,079
behold, I have made him thy Lord.

587
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,519
And his brethren have I given to him for servants,

588
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,199
and with corn and wine have I sustained him,

589
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:26,159
and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

590
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,759
And Esau said unto his father,

591
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,279
hast thou but one blessing, my father?

592
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,779
Bless me, even me also, O my father.

593
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,619
And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

594
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,299
The book of Hebrews speaks about,

595
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,179
in chapter number 12,

596
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:44,859
I think I might have said Hebrews 13 earlier,

597
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,979
but in Hebrews chapter number 12,

598
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:50,539
when the Bible speaks about this event,

599
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,979
it speaks about Esau seeking it,

600
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:56,659
but what he was seeking was not repentance,

601
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,419
he was seeking a blessing.

602
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:59,919
He was seeking it with tears.

603
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,899
The Bible says, as you think about what's happening here

604
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:04,859
in verse 39 and 40,

605
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,619
there is a record of a blessing being given

606
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,179
to Esau from Isaac.

607
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,539
It says that his father answered and said unto him,

608
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,019
behold, thy dwelling shall be in the fatness of the earth

609
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,579
and of the dew of heaven from above,

610
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,379
and by thy sword shalt thou live

611
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,899
and shalt serve thy brother,

612
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:22,219
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion

613
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:26,619
that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

614
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:29,419
I mentioned as we studied chapter 25 of the book of Genesis,

615
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,899
and we talked about those two nations

616
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:32,459
and two manner of people,

617
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,939
and we looked at that and we mentioned

618
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:37,219
how that there is recorded strife

619
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,459
between the descendants of Jacob

620
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,739
and the descendants of Esau

621
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,739
throughout the Old Testament.

622
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:45,259
The descendants of Jacob, of course, the nation of Israel,

623
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,899
the descendants of Esau, the Edomites.

624
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,339
And we read about the Edomites,

625
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,619
and in fact, you read often about the interaction

626
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,979
between the nation of Israel and the Edomites

627
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,459
and their fighting and their battles

628
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,539
and all that took place.

629
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,699
It's interesting at the end of verse number 40

630
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,539
that it says this,

631
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:05,939
it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion

632
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:09,339
that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

633
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,219
Hold your place here,

634
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:12,659
but turn to the book of 2 Kings, if you will,

635
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,219
and I just wanna reference the fulfillment of this promise

636
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,579
or this aspect of the blessing that is given

637
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:20,459
in 2 Kings chapter number eight.

638
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,179
The Bible is recording for us here

639
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,979
in the middle section of this chapter,

640
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:28,939
the reign of Jehoram, King of Judah,

641
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:31,339
and he's the son of Jehoshaphat,

642
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,619
and it tells us in verse number,

643
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,579
look in verse number 19, it says this,

644
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,579
yet the Lord would not destroy Judah

645
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:39,859
for David, his servant's sake,

646
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,459
as he promised to give him all way a lie into his children.

647
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:47,579
In his days, and so in the days of Jehoram,

648
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,699
the Bible says that in his days, in verse number 20,

649
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:52,859
Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah

650
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,619
and made a king over themselves.

651
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:58,419
So Jehoram went over to Zear and all the chariots with him

652
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,539
and he rose by night.

653
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:04,299
and smote the Edomites which compassed him about. The captain of the chariots and the

654
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:07,639
people fled into their tents." There's this battle, all that's taking place in

655
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:14,219
verse 22. Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, notice this, unto this day.

656
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:17,899
Then Libna revolted at the same time. When you see that phraseology in the scriptures

657
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:24,659
unto this day, it very regularly means the time of the writing. You'll see it often

658
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,659
in the book of Joshua, unto this day. You'll read about the memorial at Gilgal, the one

659
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:33,819
in the midst of the Jordan, and they'll talk about them being there unto this day.

660
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:39,659
It's unto the day of the writing. And we find that he's speaking there in 2 Kings

661
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:46,859
about the revolt and really what we find in this passage back in Genesis 27, that it shall

662
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,139
come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy

663
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:57,019
neck. And we find that, of course, if you look at the book of Obadiah, it's just

664
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:03,259
a short book, but there's many truths that are given in that Old Testament minor prophet

665
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:09,099
with regard to the Edomites and the descendants of Esau and how God would deal with them because

666
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:14,499
of their interactions with his people, the nation of Israel. And so we find this interaction

667
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:18,859
that's recorded. Again, it's a very unfortunate set of circumstances and you see all of the

668
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:24,539
scheming and all of the carnality and the deception that takes place, and Esau is in

669
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:31,539
this place, and he's left in this position. And, of course, Esau is no doubt, he's discouraged

670
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:41,219
by what's taken place. He, though he's carnal, he's not ever really minded anything of spiritual

671
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:46,659
value that we can read of in his life, though he's carnal, he was simply doing what his

672
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:54,759
dad told him to do. And things didn't work out well for him, and he receives this, really,

673
00:31:54,759 --> 00:32:01,379
it's a blessing that is given, but not a blessing that was the desired blessing.

674
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,699
Think about this as we finish this evening and look at the remainder of the chapter in

675
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:10,459
verses 41 through 46, the impact on the family. The impact on the family, first we see it

676
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:18,959
in Esau. Notice what the Bible says in verse 41, and Esau hated Jacob. He hated Jacob because

677
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:24,099
of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. Notice what Esau says in his heart, the

678
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:32,739
days of mourning for my father at hand, then will I slay my brother Jacob. That's unfortunate,

679
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:41,459
is it not? The reality is that the days of mourning for Isaac were not really at hand,

680
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:46,339
though Isaac thought he was going to die and through his communication to Esau, Esau believed

681
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:55,919
that Isaac would soon die. He'd lived for 40 plus more years, but you find the response

682
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:03,159
of Esau, his hatred towards his brother, his plan to kill his brother. The Bible tells

683
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:08,799
us in verse 42, in these words of Esau, her elder son were told to Rebekah. So here we

684
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,599
are, Rebekah once again gets some of this information. She's going to figure out how

685
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,519
to handle this that has now been brought to her attention. It says that she sent and called

686
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,959
Jacob her younger son and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau is touching thee, doth comfort

687
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:29,519
himself, proposing to kill thee. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, arise, flee thou to

688
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,719
Laban, my brother to Haran. So now Jacob is going to have to depart because of the circumstances,

689
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:39,839
because of what's taken place, and he's going to have to depart. Notice what it says in

690
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:47,719
verse number 44, and tarry with him, notice these three words, a few days. Tarry with

691
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:57,639
him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away. It wasn't a few days, was it?

692
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:08,399
You know the sad truth? Rebekah would never see Jacob again. She never saw her son again.

693
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,559
The words of verse number 13, I said to be mindful of those words, that his mother said

694
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:23,079
unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice and go fetch me them. And now

695
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:30,759
because of the hatred that Esau has for Jacob because of the blessing, because of his purposing

696
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:41,239
to kill Jacob, Rebekah says, go to my brother and stay there a few days until Esau's anger,

697
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:50,839
until his fury turn away. Rebekah would never see her son again. She'd never see Jacob again.

698
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:59,119
Turned into years, in Genesis 31 and verse number 38, notice what I'm jumping right into

699
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,799
the middle of the text of Scripture, but Jacob says this, This twenty years have I been with

700
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:10,039
thee. Thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock

701
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:23,439
have I not eaten. A few days, twenty years. It's a long time. The impact on the family.

702
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:30,039
By the way, during those twenty years, Jacob was deceived on more than one occasion, wasn't

703
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:37,399
he? It's unfortunate, all that transpired. In verse 45, she continues, Until thy brother's

704
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:42,879
anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him, then I will

705
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:49,759
send and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

706
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:55,039
And so, she says, I'm going to send you there, but when his anger, when Esau's anger is turned

707
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,159
away from thee, and he forgets what's taken place, then I'm going to send for you, and

708
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:05,719
I'm going to bring you back. Again, that message, those messengers never went. But I want you

709
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:13,559
to find how the passage ends in verse 46, that Rebecca says to Isaac, I am weary of

710
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:21,439
my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth,

711
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:28,279
such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do to me?

712
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:33,359
And basically, what Rebecca does, and it leads into chapter number 28 with the departure

713
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,439
of Jacob, and how Isaac would respond to what Rebecca says, is Rebecca is basically

714
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:47,559
saying to Isaac, we don't want our son, Jacob, to marry the way that Esau married. Remember,

715
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:53,079
the Bible tells us at the end of chapter 26 that these wives that Esau took, that they

716
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:59,879
were a grief of mine unto Isaac and to Rebecca in Genesis 26 and verse number 35. Now, the

717
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:06,679
real purpose that she relays to Jacob for sending him away is because of the plan of

718
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:12,879
Esau to kill him. But now she comes into the presence of Isaac and says, let's send Jacob

719
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:22,999
away because we really want him to marry. And you find that the chapter is full of carnality,

720
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:32,559
deception, scheming, leaning on our own understanding from the beginning to the end of the chapter,

721
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:40,359
46 verses. And it's sad, is it not? And as I look at this passage of Scripture and I

722
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,799
try to dig it apart and say, okay, God, what do You want us to learn? The reality is that

723
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:49,479
as we go to the Word of God, He's always got lessons for us to learn. And there are times

724
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:54,959
in which we learn the behavior of an individual that is an appropriate behavior that we are

725
00:37:54,959 --> 00:38:00,859
to model ourselves after that behavior. Remember what Paul said? He said, the things that you've

726
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:05,759
heard of me but the things that you've seen in me do. Paul says this to the believers

727
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:08,999
in Corinth. He says that to the believers in Philippi. To the believers in Corinth,

728
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:14,999
he says, be followers of me even as I'm a follower of the Lord. And we find that there

729
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:19,399
are some people that we can look to and we can look at their examples and we can learn

730
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:25,519
from their behavior and we can say, that is exemplary behavior that is worthy of taking

731
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,219
and applying and adopting those behaviors in my life. But then there's passages like

732
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:38,699
Genesis chapter number 27 that are just the opposite. These are things not to do. These

733
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:43,619
are examples that should be warnings to us, like what we find in the book of 1 Corinthians

734
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,199
when God says to the believers in Corinth, He says, listen, Paul is speaking to them,

735
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:53,039
and he says, listen, with many of them God was not well pleased. In other words, take

736
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,880
heed. Don't follow their example. Don't follow their behavior. And I hope this evening

737
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:08,179
that we can learn from some negative behavior in Genesis 27. And we can guard against in

738
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:16,440
our lives relying on our own understanding and thinking that we have to scheme. I said

739
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:23,539
this often throughout the last couple of chapters of the book of Genesis. Living by faith does

740
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:33,019
not require scheming. It just doesn't. We do not have to scheme in this life. We can

741
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:40,019
trust God. You say, but I don't see a way. Neither did they. You don't want to go down

742
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:47,039
that path. Amen? As soon as you allow that thought, I don't see a way, and I have to

743
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,719
start relying on my own understanding, you start going down a path that leads to poor

744
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:59,440
decision making apart from God this evening.

745
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,680
My heart is saddened by Genesis 27, I'm just being transparent with you this evening.

746
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,880
As I meditated upon this passage this week, and I read it again this afternoon, and I'm

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:17,680
like, this is heartbreaking to see so much carnality and deception in one chapter of

748
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,600
God's precious book by people that had previously inquired of the Lord.

749
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,720
When Isaac and Rebekah had no children, what did they do?

750
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,880
In Genesis 25, what did they do?

751
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,440
The two of them prayed, said, God, we have no children.

752
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,080
God blessed.

753
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,840
When Rebekah was, there's a struggle within the womb, she inquired of the Lord, and God

754
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,840
answered.

755
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:57,560
And how easy it is for us to rely on our own understanding, and to think that we need to

756
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,000
figure things out.

757
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,279
I don't know how God could have or would have worked in Genesis 27.

758
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,600
It's hypothetical.

759
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,020
Because the decisions were made that resulted in the consequences that are recorded.

760
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,880
But wouldn't it be interesting in your mind to just think about some of the other passages

761
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,959
of Scripture that we read and we see God moving and working in phenomenal ways and bringing

762
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:30,040
to pass those things that you'd say, we never could figure out how this was going to happen.

763
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
But God.

764
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,639
You ever read those statements in the Word of God?

765
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,639
But God.

766
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,160
You say, man, this is exciting.

767
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,440
Because God did what only God could do.

768
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,200
The Bible tells us in Psalm 78, and I'll end with this.

769
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,680
Psalm 78 is a long psalm.

770
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,400
And it deals primarily, it records a lot of the history of Israel and it goes through

771
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,240
a number of events.

772
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,360
Somewhere around verse number 41, the Bible says this, that they, the children of Israel,

773
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,279
limited the Holy One of Israel.

774
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:10,160
The unlimited God, the Almighty God.

775
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,880
What limited Him?

776
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,919
Their unbelief.

777
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,199
Their sin.

778
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,559
Their scheming.

779
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:20,600
This evening, I don't want to limit God.

780
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,360
I don't want to see what my plan can bring to pass.

781
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,419
Didn't work out well for them in Genesis 27.

782
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:34,160
For Rebekah and Jacob, their plan didn't work out well.

783
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,279
He received the blessing.

784
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to see God's plan.

785
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Amen?

786
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,440
See what God can do.

787
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,760
Because we serve the Almighty Creator of the universe.

788
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,040
And He is able, as I said this morning in Sunday school, to do exceeding abundantly

789
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,440
above all that we ask or think.

790
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,279
Joseph at once said, daddy, you forgot to emphasize that word all in Sunday school.

791
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:07,479
You talked about all the other words.

792
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:08,839
But all.

793
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,960
So Joseph, there you go.

794
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,000
All that we ask or think, amen?

795
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,320
He is.

796
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,880
We serve a great God.

797
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,600
Let's trust Him and let Him have His way.

798
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
Let's pray.

799
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Father, we love You.

800
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,160
Thank You for loving us.

801
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:38,520
I know that it's so easy, perhaps easier for some than others, but it's so easy as humans

802
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:46,720
to want to take things, matters, into our own hands.

803
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,279
God, I pray that tonight You'd help us to learn from this passage of Scripture to rely

804
00:43:51,279 --> 00:44:06,720
fully upon Thee, that we might see You do the impossible from our human perspective,

805
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:15,320
that we might see You do what we might not even be able to imagine.

806
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:29,600
Help us to live by faith without scheming, refusing to even start down that path.

807
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,959
Help us to simply trust You.

808
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:37,559
Well, thank You, God, for what You'll do in our hearts and lives as You teach us from

809
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:39,279
Your Word.

810
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:43,519
Would You move and work as only You can, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
