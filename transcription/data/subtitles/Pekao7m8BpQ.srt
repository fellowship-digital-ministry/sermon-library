1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Galatians chapter number four, and thankful to have some folks visiting with us this morning.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We do certainly hope and pray the service will be a blessing to you.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Galatians chapter number four, we'll focus on verses four through seven.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to begin reading in verse number one, and read down through our text this morning.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Galatians chapter number four, and then we will dig into the message this morning.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Beginning in verse number one, Galatians four, the Bible says,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Even so we, when we were children, notice, were in bondage under the elements of the world.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But, I'm so thankful for that little word, a conjunction,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we find that here in this particular passage of Scripture,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the truth that will be revealed to us in these next few verses is so powerful and so beautiful.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It says,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But, in verse number four, when the fullness of the time was come,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And because you are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Abba, Father, wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a beautiful passage of Scripture that reminds us of our position in Christ,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but also reminds us of the purpose of the incarnation in which we celebrate here

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
at this particular time of year.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For many, Christmas is their favorite time of year.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No doubt you've heard people mention that they love this time of year and what have you.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And really, it's easy for us to understand why someone would have that perspective.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As believers, however, our perspective of Christmas should be different

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
than those that do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There are some this morning that you could speak to that would say that this time of year,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that the Christmas season is their favorite time of year,

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and yet they do not know the true purpose for which we celebrate this season,

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
this holiday, if you will, this holy day,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in which we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We understand this morning that we're not sure of the exact timing, the date in which Christ was born.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We do not believe that it was December 25th, but we do find that on our calendar each year,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we have an opportunity to be mindful of, to remember the truth that Jesus, God, became man.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That He was born in a lowly manger, that He was born with a specific purpose.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I know this morning that we've heard people say, and perhaps you've even read the bumper sticker,

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've seen it from time to time, that would say this,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So many today are walking around in our society as we see this cultural shift,

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and understand with me this morning, there's always going to be cultural wars,

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and really they're not cultural wars, they're spiritual wars.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We call them, we sometimes hear people refer to them as being cultural wars,

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but really all they are is spiritual wars.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's been a spiritual warfare that's been brewing and battling

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
from the time of the account in Genesis of the creation of man,

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and we understand that we are engaged in spiritual battle in this particular time and era.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In fact, for a number of years now, you've seen a shift in our nation,

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
away from people using the phrase, Merry Christmas, and replacing it with Happy Holidays.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not sure about you, but I insist, I am absolutely adamant on saying Merry Christmas.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And when someone doesn't respond, I make sure that they hear me again,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and I'm not trying to be rude or unkind, but I want to make sure that they hear me.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not necessarily demanding that they respond to me in like fashion,

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but I want to make sure that they've heard that I've said Merry Christmas,

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and we understand this morning.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mentioned it in Sunday School, listen, I even knew as a child that was lost,

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that did not go to church, we didn't even go to church on Christmas.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I knew, however, that Christmas was about the birth of Jesus.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I didn't know why Jesus was born, I didn't understand all of the reason,

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but I knew that Christmas was about the birth of Jesus.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We sang songs as a family.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
My dad, those young people don't even know what records are, but we had record players,

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and there was a time, and I remember I was about seven or eight years old,

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that my dad took all the records and copied them onto cassette tapes,

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and we were in business at that point because we had all the Christmas songs on cassette tapes,

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and we'd listen to the Christmas songs, and many of them, I said this again in Sunday School,

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
many of those Christmas songs, even that you'll hear on worldly music stations,

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
they sing about the birth of Christ.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They sing about the glory, the joy of that moment in history when God became man.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We refer to it as the incarnation.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I knew as a lost young boy that Christmas was about the birth of Jesus.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't understand all the reason, but I understood that.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now as a believer, oh, how overwhelmed and joyful I am to know that as we celebrate this time of year,

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
though it's full of traditions, though it has been commercialized by our society,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that you and I this morning, that we are blessed to know the true meaning by which we celebrate this holiday.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've titled the message here from Galatians 4 this morning,

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The Miracle of Christmas.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Miracle of Christmas.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is it about Christmas that would lead me, would lead you, would lead us to say that it's miraculous?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
As we look at our text of Scripture, I want you to see just a few thoughts,

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and I hope that this morning we would understand the miracle of Christmas.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
First, if you're taking notes, notice with me what God did.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In verse number four, the Bible tells us what God did.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It says this, but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want you to think about that phraseology, and we'll continue to dig through the portion of Scripture

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
here in just a few moments as we make our way through it this morning.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But notice with me that the Bible tells us that what God did was God sent forth his Son.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That word sent forth carries with it the idea to dispatch.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It really has this commentation, to send off to a destination for a purpose.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, we sometimes hear of in some of the world today, you think about the police and law enforcement, first responders.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They have dispatchers, and they dispatch someone to a position, a destination, for, with a purpose.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Begin to think about this verse of Scripture when the Bible says God sent forth his Son.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We find that this happened, according to verse number four, when the fullness of the time was come.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We often speak about God's timing, and God's timing being perfect.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And it is, it's impeccable, it's always right on time.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And the Bible says that when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He sent him to a destination, this sin-cursed world, with a specific purpose.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It really, not only was it a specific purpose, it was a singular purpose.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And we find that we could look at some secondary, we could look at some things,

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and how, obviously, Peter mentions that he left us an example that we should follow his steps.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But singularly, specifically, Jesus was sent to redeem mankind.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He came to this sin-cursed world, the world that he created, the world that he created in perfect shape.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And we find that he, in perfection, created the world, he created man.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In that state of innocency, we understand that the enemy, Satan himself, came into that garden and he tempted Eve.

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And at that moment, according to Genesis chapter number three, sin entered into the world.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I want us to understand this morning, that it wasn't at that time, in Genesis three,

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that God determined, I'm going to send forth my Son.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, it was determined even before the foundation of the world.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why do we say that? Well, because the Bible says that.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And God tells us that he is eternal.

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the Bible tells us that Jesus is eternal and that he is the Lamb of God

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that was slain before the foundation of the world.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We begin to think about what God did and God sent forth his Son.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When did it happen? When the fullness of the time was come.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we find that Jesus is eternal.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He has no beginning and no ending. He is Alpha and Omega.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you read Revelation chapter number one, we won't take the time this morning,

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but it's a beautiful passage of scripture that reveals to us the person and nature of the Lord Jesus Christ

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and reveals to us his deity, that he is God.

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And we find here that as we look at this truth, that God sent forth his Son again to dispatch,

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to send off to a destination for a purpose,

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
reminds us even in the verbiage here that God is, Jesus is eternal.

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's God. Notice in John chapter number one.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Take just a moment and turn back to the gospel of John, if you will.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,400
And I want you to see that the Bible reveals to us that Jesus, He is God and He is eternal.

125
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,720
The Bible tells us here in John chapter number 1, again a very familiar passage of scripture

126
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,659
for many of us this morning.

127
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,959
And the Bible says in John chapter number 1, in the beginning was the Word.

128
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,600
And the Word was with God and the Word was God.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,440
Isn't that beautiful?

130
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,119
There's some modern translations that change that to say that He was a God.

131
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,439
No, no, understand that He is God.

132
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,919
He is God.

133
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,200
The same was in the beginning with God.

134
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,119
Notice all things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.

135
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:52,840
In Him was life and the life was the light of men.

136
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,159
Verse 14 says it this way.

137
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,279
It says that in the Word, that same Word that we see in verses 1, in the beginning

138
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,840
was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.

139
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,440
The Word was made flesh.

140
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,080
That's what we're talking about in Galatians chapter number 4.

141
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,599
When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son.

142
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:20,279
He was made flesh, notice, and dwelt among us.

143
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,360
And we beheld His glory.

144
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,639
John is writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

145
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,760
John is one of the disciples and he's saying we plural because the other disciples, we

146
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,160
beheld His glory.

147
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,279
Notice the glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

148
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
John bear witness of Him.

149
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Now understand this is not the writer of the Gospel of John.

150
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,839
No, this John that's referred to in verse number 15, this is John the Baptist.

151
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,639
And the Bible says John bear witness of Him.

152
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,480
John was the one that was a voice crying in the wilderness.

153
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,559
He's the one that said behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.

154
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,039
And the Bible says that John bear witness of Him and cried saying this was He of whom

155
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,800
I spake, He that cometh after me.

156
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:19,639
He's referring to a position of time in the fact that John the Baptist was born first.

157
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:27,199
He's a cousin of Jesus Christ, fleshly speaking of the flesh, and he says that He that cometh

158
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,199
after me, notice, is preferred before me.

159
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,199
Why?

160
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,279
For He was before me.

161
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,720
In one verse of Scripture, John the Baptist as he's testifying of the Lord Jesus Christ,

162
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,160
he's speaking of His birth after me, I am older physically, but He's preferred before

163
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
me.

164
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Why?

165
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,679
Because He is eternal.

166
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,559
It's an amazing truth.

167
00:12:52,559 --> 00:13:00,440
And the Bible says that God, what He did was He sent forth His Son and Jesus is eternal.

168
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,039
Jesus in fact in John 17, you don't need to turn there, I'll read the verse for you, but

169
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,559
in verse number 5 of John 17, Jesus is praying, this is right before He goes to the cross

170
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,880
of Calvary, and He says this in verse number 5, and now O Father, glorify Thou me with

171
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:25,479
Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.

172
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:30,600
Now if He's not God, He could never make that statement.

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,360
You can't make that statement, I can't make that statement, but because Jesus is God and

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,839
He's eternal, He's able to say with the glory, notice that it says here, which I had with

175
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,759
Thee before the world was.

176
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,080
God sent forth His Son.

177
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,639
That's what God did.

178
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,059
That's miraculous.

179
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:03,559
We find that this event that we look to, this truth of the incarnation, this moment in history

180
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,119
that we celebrate here at the Christmas season, this was something that had been prophesied

181
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,119
in the Old Testament.

182
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:14,160
You could look in the book of Genesis, even in the third chapter, at the time in which

183
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,040
God is speaking with Adam and Eve after sin entered, and you find that God there gives

184
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,399
the first promise of the Messiah who would come.

185
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,959
In Genesis 3 and verse 15, you can read in the book of Numbers, you think about the wise

186
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:36,119
men with the star, and they see about that truth really from Numbers chapter 24.

187
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:41,440
You can find throughout the Old Testament prophecy after prophecy with regard to the

188
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,959
birth of Christ, the incarnation, the miracle of Christmas, that God sent forth His Son.

189
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,959
When?

190
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,040
When the fullness of time was come.

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,339
We look at these prophecies and we can rejoice in the prophecies that God gave us, and notice

192
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,200
as you consider the prophecies that God spoke, not only of the truth that He would send forth

193
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,079
His Son that Messiah would be born, He reveals to us in the prophecies not only the truth

194
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,880
that He would be born, but where He would be born and how He would be born.

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,000
It's amazing when you consider the prophecies with regard to the first coming of the Lord

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Jesus Christ.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,839
And all of those prophecies were fulfilled on that night.

198
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,399
As you read the accounts, we'll read them tonight in the book of Luke and in the book

199
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,880
of Matthew, and you read those accounts and the angel that comes and announces the birth

200
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,559
of Christ, I mean what joy!

201
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:45,940
And even the angel that announced to Mary about the truth of the birth and how miraculous

202
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,959
this is, and we find it was prophesied.

203
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,040
In Micah 5 it prophesies of the place in which Jesus would be born.

204
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,920
In Daniel 9 it prophesies of the timing in which Jesus would be born.

205
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,160
It's interesting to me that even the Jewish people that had the scriptures, that should

206
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,000
have known not only the timing and the place, that they weren't really looking for the birth

207
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,440
of the Messiah.

208
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,679
When those wise men come, they say, where is He that is born, King of the Jews?

209
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,640
Herod's paranoid, he's always paranoid anyway if you study his life and all the things about

210
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,519
him, he's a paranoid individual, and he's paranoid because the greeting is, where is

211
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,239
He that is born, King of the Jews?

212
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,239
So what does he do?

213
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:38,920
He inquires with the scribes and they say, oh, in Bethlehem, Ephrathah.

214
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,200
For thus it is prophesied.

215
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,519
They knew the prophecy, but they weren't looking for the Messiah.

216
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,640
Isaiah 9 in verse number 6 tells us that His name shall be called wonderful.

217
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Let's actually look at it.

218
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,339
Isaiah 9 in verse number 6, oh, it's beautiful to consider the promise here in Isaiah 9 with

219
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,299
regard to the truth of this, what God did.

220
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,100
He sent forth His Son.

221
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,899
In Isaiah 9 in verse number 6, notice the Bible says, for unto us a child is born.

222
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:18,619
But then notice it says this, unto us a son is given.

223
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:23,059
A child is born, a son is given.

224
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,179
God sent forth His Son.

225
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,339
We see that in Galatians 4 and verse number 4, that what did God do?

226
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,500
He sent forth His Son.

227
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,579
When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son.

228
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,299
And it says here in Isaiah 9 in verse number 6, for unto us a child is born, unto us a

229
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,519
son is given.

230
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,420
And the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called wonderful, Counselor,

231
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,779
the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.

232
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,820
Wow, that's our Savior.

233
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
What did God do?

234
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,260
Well, God sent forth His Son.

235
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Notice back in Galatians chapter 4, notice how God did it, number 2.

236
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,779
We notice what God did, but notice how God did it.

237
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:17,579
The Bible tells us this in verse number 4, but when the fullness of the time was come,

238
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:28,320
God sent forth His Son, then notice, made of a woman, made under the law.

239
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,659
We see here in Galatians 4 and verse number 4, when we consider not only what God did,

240
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:37,659
but how God did it, we see the truth of the virgin birth.

241
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,119
Miraculous in every sense of the word.

242
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,559
The truth that God would send forth His Son, but it says that Jesus, made of a woman, made

243
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,719
under the law.

244
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:53,960
We understand this truth of the virgin birth of Christ, and we understand that because

245
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,799
of this truth, and because of the way in which God did this, He sent forth His Son, but He

246
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,719
sent Him forth made of a woman, and we find the truth of the virgin birth, it's miraculous

247
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:11,799
in every sense of the word, and we find that He would have no human, earthly Father, there'd

248
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,119
be no sin nature.

249
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,119
He's sinless.

250
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,520
He's without sin.

251
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
He's God.

252
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,760
And you begin to think about this, turn back again, I just had you in Isaiah 9, but look

253
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,960
at Isaiah 7 if you will, and then we'll go over to the book of Luke just for a moment,

254
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,400
but look in Isaiah chapter number 7, and again, one of these prophecies with regard to the

255
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,000
coming of Messiah and understanding the truth that God gives us here, even in the Old Testament

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,359
about this day, this day of Christmas that we celebrate, the birth of our Messiah, the

257
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:53,080
birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible says in Isaiah 7 in verse 14, it says, This

258
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,159
therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign, what is this sign?

259
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,039
Notice, behold, a virgin.

260
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:09,459
The virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel.

261
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:14,259
Again I mentioned about some of the modern translations they say in John 1 that he was

262
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:19,899
a God instead of he is God and then we find here in Isaiah 7 14 that some change the word

263
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,659
virgin to a young maid.

264
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,459
Can I tell you this morning that's not the same.

265
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,139
Amen?

266
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,599
It is not the same.

267
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:37,039
And here the Bible says that the sign that God would give is that a virgin shall conceive

268
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,799
and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel.

269
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,159
Now look at what the Bible says in Luke chapter number 1 and think about for generations of

270
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,719
people from this announcement in Isaiah chapter number 7 this prophecy with regard to the

271
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:03,199
manner in which God would send forth his son the Messiah that he would be born of

272
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,879
a woman, born of a virgin.

273
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:12,179
In Luke chapter number 1 in verse number 26 the Bible says in the sixth month the angel

274
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,759
Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth.

275
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:25,639
Notice what the Bible says to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph to the house

276
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,919
of David and the virgin's name was Mary.

277
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,639
Was Mary.

278
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:36,999
You see that the Bible references twice in verse number 27 that she was a virgin.

279
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:42,319
Yes she was espoused to a man whose name was Joseph but understand that even as this announcement

280
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:48,079
comes in verse number 28 the Bible says that the angel came in unto her and said hail thou

281
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,539
that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women.

282
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,459
And when she saw him she was troubled at this saying and cast in her mind what manner

283
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:03,819
of salutation this should be and the angels said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found

284
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:12,019
favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt

285
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,859
call his name Jesus.

286
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:20,459
The Bible says in verse 32 and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest

287
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:24,339
and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign

288
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:28,379
over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and we won't

289
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:32,419
take the time this morning but you can see in verse 32 and 33 the fulfillment of the

290
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,499
Davidic covenant through the Lord Jesus Christ but then notice verse 34 notice the response

291
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:47,179
of Mary then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man.

292
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,579
What's she referring to here?

293
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:55,459
She's referring to her chaste her purity that we find as it's mentioned in verse 27 that

294
00:22:55,459 --> 00:23:02,979
she's a virgin remember in Isaiah 7 in verse number 14 the sign is going to be that a virgin

295
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:08,739
would bring forth a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and here she says how can this

296
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:14,259
thing be she understood just like most of us understand this morning the process in

297
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:21,139
which birth is conception is given by God and she says how shall this be seeing I know

298
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:26,179
not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee

299
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:31,179
and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which

300
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:35,859
shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God.

301
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:42,379
Wow miraculous in every sense of the word.

302
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,739
The Bible says in verse 36 and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a

303
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:51,459
son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

304
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:56,499
That's another miracle in of itself but a miracle of conception between Elizabeth and

305
00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:02,779
Zacharias and God allowed them to have a son John the Baptist it's mentioned here of that

306
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:07,819
truth that she had conceived in her old age but then notice this phrase in verse 37 for

307
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:15,259
with God nothing shall be impossible.

308
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:23,459
You say explain to me the virgin birth it's miraculous it's miraculous it is God sending

309
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:31,139
forth his son made of a woman made under the law see Jesus had to come in the form of a

310
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:40,579
man he's the God man he never stopped being God but he had to come as a man so that he

311
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,259
could die for you and for me.

312
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,739
He could not come as an angel he could not come as any other no he had to come as a man

313
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:53,899
made under the law and notice with me that as we look at this portion of scripture in

314
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:59,219
Galatians 4 we notice not only what God did and how God did it but number three we consider

315
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:07,739
this morning why God did it why did God do it well in Galatians chapter number four and

316
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:16,139
verse number five the Bible says to redeem them that were under the law that we might

317
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:23,339
receive the adoption of sons you know who them and we you know that is that's us that's

318
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:31,419
humanity that's humanity to redeem them that were under the law you know every human being

319
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:35,459
that's been born upon this earth outside of the Lord Jesus Christ God and flesh the God

320
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:45,459
man has been born under the law sinners with a sinful nature and here the Bible says that

321
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:50,779
not only as we consider the truth of verse four and verse number five of Galatians 4

322
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:55,499
not only was the birth of Christ prophesied but we find that it had a specific purpose

323
00:25:55,499 --> 00:26:00,539
remember when the Bible said in verse number four that God sent forth his son that word

324
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:08,899
means to dispatch it means to send off to a destination remember this for a purpose

325
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:15,099
the purpose is given to us in verse number five to redeem them that were under the law

326
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:21,939
that we might receive the adoption of sons and that word redeem means to ransom Christ

327
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:28,579
freeing from the dominion of the law through his vicarious death and subsequent resurrection

328
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:33,059
you know there's only one way to be redeemed only one way to be redeemed we sing about

329
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:45,379
redemption we sing redeemed redeemed redeemed by the blood of the lamb and that's the only

330
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:51,279
way to be redeemed there's no other way to be redeemed redemption is only through the

331
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,739
Lord Jesus Christ and we find in the passage of scripture here when we consider this truth

332
00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:02,659
of redemption we are aware of the fact that it's motivated by love that mankind can only

333
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:09,619
be redeemed and needed to be redeemed because of our sin our sin separated us from a holy

334
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:15,219
God and we needed redemption it's only possible through the Lord Jesus Christ through his

335
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:21,739
blood that would be shed and then his resurrection we find that it's motivated by love why would

336
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:31,779
we say such a thing for John 3 16 says for God so loved the world that he gave his only

337
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,819
begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting

338
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:44,379
life it's motivated by love for God so loved the world so what did he do he he gave his

339
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:48,779
only begotten Son right here in Galatians 4 we see that the Bible says that God when

340
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,939
the fullness of the time was come that God sent forth his Son and we find that the purpose

341
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:59,299
is so that we could be redeemed the Bible tells us in the book of 1st Peter in verse

342
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:05,099
in chapter number 1 and verses 18 through 21 the Bible teaches us about redemption here

343
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:12,159
and the the only way by which mankind can be redeemed see for most people it's obvious

344
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:19,059
and quite easy for us to acknowledge that we're sinners that we have violated God's

345
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:26,279
law God's law by the way is a whole lot more than just the Ten Commandments but just by

346
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,839
looking quickly at the Ten Commandments it's very easy for us to acknowledge that we are

347
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:37,639
guilty the book of James says that if we've offended in one point we're guilty of all

348
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:43,239
you say well I lined up pretty good I've kept most of them but you're guilty of all I would

349
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:48,199
argue this morning that all of us have broken all of the Ten Commandments at some point

350
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:54,059
in our lives and that reveals to us that we're guilty in just a chapter before in the book

351
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:59,739
of Galatians you know what the Bible tells us about the law it cannot give life you know

352
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:05,179
what the law does the law simply reveals to us that we're lost and the law points us to

353
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:10,859
the one the only one that can redeem us the Lord Jesus Christ Galatians 3 refers to it

354
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:18,099
as being a schoolmaster and you begin to think about the truth that God gives us there in

355
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:25,659
that portion of Scripture he says that that that righteousness listen cannot come by the law Paul

356
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,440
says it this way I do not frustrate the grace of God if righteousness came by the law then

357
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,820
Christ is dead in vain but we know and we agree this morning that Christ's death on the cross of

358
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,739
Calvary was not in vain it was very purposed in 1st Peter chapter 1 in verse 18 the Bible says

359
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:48,979
this for as much as you know now understand this morning that in 1st Peter the book of 1st Peter

360
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:54,859
Peter is writing to believers he's writing to those that have been saved those that have trusted the

361
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,419
Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior how do we know that well you read the first chapter the

362
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:00,019
first few verses

363
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:02,439
and you understand that he's writing to believers.

364
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:05,619
He's not writing to those that have not yet trusted Christ.

365
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:07,659
He's writing to those that have been scattered abroad

366
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,819
that have trusted Christ as their Savior.

367
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:12,239
And as he's talking to that audience,

368
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:15,379
he says that you know, for as much as ye know.

369
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:18,499
Now, some, and maybe even some here this morning

370
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:19,539
under the sound of my voice,

371
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:22,139
whether they're here locally or tuned in via live stream,

372
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:26,379
they do not know the truth of redemption.

373
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:27,679
For many of us here this morning,

374
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,379
we do know the truth of redemption,

375
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,779
and we know that we've been redeemed

376
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,259
with the precious blood of Christ,

377
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:35,299
but maybe some would not be able to say that they know,

378
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,499
and it says here that you were not redeemed

379
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,059
with corruptible things,

380
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,619
as silver and gold from your vain conversation

381
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,979
received by tradition from your fathers.

382
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,859
But notice verse 19,

383
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,679
but with the precious blood of Christ,

384
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,759
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,

385
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,379
who verily was for ordained

386
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,179
before the foundation of the world,

387
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,899
but was manifest in these last times for you.

388
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,659
How was he manifest?

389
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,459
The incarnation.

390
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,039
This truth that we're speaking about

391
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,859
in Galatians chapter number four,

392
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,179
when the fullness of time was come,

393
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,259
God sent forth his son.

394
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,019
This is how he was made manifest.

395
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:13,779
Notice in verse 21,

396
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,879
who by him do believe in God

397
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,979
that raised him up from the dead

398
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:20,779
and gave him glory that your faith and hope

399
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,179
might be in God.

400
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,059
The truth that we find here this morning,

401
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,539
we find in Galatians chapter number four,

402
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,979
what God did, God sent forth his son.

403
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:34,199
We notice and we understand this morning

404
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,299
how God did it.

405
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,979
He sent forth his son made of a woman,

406
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,059
made under the law.

407
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:43,259
We find that the virgin birth is miraculous.

408
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,359
We find that the reason that God did it,

409
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,739
why did God do this?

410
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,939
Why did God send forth his son?

411
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,259
To redeem.

412
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,939
Miraculous.

413
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:56,419
The miracle of Christmas.

414
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,099
And we find again,

415
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,119
that as we look at this portion of scripture,

416
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,659
that God gives us some wonderful truth

417
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,899
with regard to the purpose

418
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,499
and the fulfillment of this purpose.

419
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:07,979
Notice it says in verse number five,

420
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,739
again and back in Galatians four,

421
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,459
to redeem them that were under the law

422
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:16,459
that we might receive the adoption of sons.

423
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:19,339
Now this begins to really help us

424
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:22,379
understand our position in Christ.

425
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:23,879
Someone that's here this morning,

426
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:24,979
if you've been saved,

427
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:26,019
if you've been born again,

428
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,339
if you've recognized that you're a guilty sinner,

429
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,939
that Jesus Christ is the only savior

430
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:32,939
and that there's no other way to heaven,

431
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:36,299
it's only through the blood of Christ,

432
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,039
the encouragement to you this morning

433
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,899
would be trust Christ as your savior.

434
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,079
Today is the day of salvation.

435
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,059
For every child of God that's here this morning,

436
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,059
I want us to rejoice in our position in Christ.

437
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,419
And if you've not been saved,

438
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:52,419
if you get saved,

439
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:53,859
if you trust Christ as your savior,

440
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:56,259
this too would be your position in Christ.

441
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,219
Notice it says that we receive

442
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:01,819
the adoption of sons.

443
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,979
This truth of adoption

444
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:05,739
that God reveals to us here

445
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,139
in this portion of scripture.

446
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:08,979
He then says this in verse six,

447
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:12,699
and because your sons,

448
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,979
God had sent forth the spirit of his son

449
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,939
into your hearts.

450
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,459
What does it say?

451
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,979
Crying, Abba, father.

452
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,299
Now, all of a sudden,

453
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,339
I have a relationship with God

454
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,499
that I did not have prior

455
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:31,099
to trusting Christ as my savior.

456
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,459
I was an enemy of Christ.

457
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,219
I was at enmity.

458
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:38,019
I needed to be reconciled.

459
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,859
And the only way for me to be reconciled,

460
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,299
the only way for me to be redeemed

461
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:42,919
was through the work of Christ,

462
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,259
God in flesh,

463
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,859
the miracle of Christmas,

464
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,219
the incarnation.

465
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,139
And that was the only way

466
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:49,979
that I could be,

467
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:52,579
that you could be reconciled and redeemed.

468
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,739
We find that He then tells us

469
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:57,459
that we have this relationship with God

470
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:00,899
wherein we cry, Abba, father.

471
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,899
I'm so thankful that God is my father.

472
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,499
The idea of the word Abba

473
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,539
is a very intimate word,

474
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:12,099
a word that maybe we would use

475
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:13,979
in our culture and our society today

476
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,299
of daddy.

477
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:19,059
It's an intimate...

478
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,619
Listen, I'm thankful that God

479
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,779
is a personal God.

480
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:23,859
I'm thankful this morning

481
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,739
that He's my father

482
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,979
and I can go to Him

483
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:29,259
on the basis of my sonship,

484
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,699
that I can go to Him

485
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,659
and understanding that He's my father

486
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,699
and I'm His son.

487
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,899
I have this relationship.

488
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:39,659
I've been adopted into the family of God.

489
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,219
We sing the song, hallelujah,

490
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,499
I'm adopted.

491
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,859
I'm a child of the King.

492
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:46,819
And it's a wonderful truth.

493
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:47,659
And it's a truth

494
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,739
that's based on biblical truth

495
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,459
as we would sing that song.

496
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:53,019
And we find here this morning

497
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,419
that we, if you've trusted Christ,

498
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:57,379
that you now, you've been adopted,

499
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,219
you're a son,

500
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,579
you have that sonship,

501
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,219
that relationship.

502
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:02,059
You know something

503
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,259
that's beautiful about relationship

504
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,539
is it doesn't change.

505
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,219
Relationship doesn't change.

506
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:09,059
I'm a son.

507
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,739
You're either a son

508
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,339
or a daughter here this morning.

509
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:16,179
Everyone that's here this morning has parents.

510
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,699
Now your parents may still be living,

511
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,339
your parents may not be living any longer,

512
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,259
but every one of us have parents.

513
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:23,499
Do you agree?

514
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:26,459
This is real basic, kindergarten, amen.

515
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,379
We all have parents.

516
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:30,819
In your relationship with your parents,

517
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:32,459
you're their child.

518
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,099
You're their son or their daughter.

519
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,139
No matter what circumstances happen,

520
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:39,099
no matter what events would transpire in your life,

521
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,819
they are always your parents

522
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,659
and you're always their child.

523
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:43,499
Do we agree?

524
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,459
I know that in our society today,

525
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,379
you have this thing

526
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:48,899
where there are children

527
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:49,739
that are divorcing their parents.

528
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,139
It's wild, it's unbelievable

529
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:53,459
that this concept could even take place.

530
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:55,659
But even if you get a paper

531
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,739
that says that you're divorced from your parents,

532
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,339
the truth, the reality

533
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,979
is that you're still their child.

534
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:07,539
There's nothing that can change that relationship.

535
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,419
And I love the fact that God uses the terminology

536
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,459
that we are sons.

537
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,899
This legal transaction of adoption

538
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:17,179
that he refers to here,

539
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,699
this sonship that we receive

540
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,299
at the moment of salvation,

541
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,979
I have a relationship with God.

542
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:26,019
Oh yes, the truth is that my fellowship with God

543
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,739
may vary from day to day.

544
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:30,459
But one thing that's constant,

545
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,739
one thing that will never change

546
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,019
is my relationship with God,

547
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:37,899
that he's my father and I'm his son.

548
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:40,139
How is this made possible?

549
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:42,179
The miracle of Christmas.

550
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,299
The fact that God sent forth his son.

551
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,059
The fact that he came with a purpose

552
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,899
to redeem them that were under the law.

553
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,659
And I now have this newfound relationship.

554
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:58,099
And again, though my fellowship may change,

555
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,459
just like your fellowship and my fellowship

556
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,499
with my earthly parents would change from time to time.

557
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,899
You go through that season,

558
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:08,939
many go through that season of teenagers

559
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:11,819
and there's some difficult years perhaps

560
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:14,819
that are experienced between some parents

561
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:16,899
and some children.

562
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,259
But at the end of the day,

563
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,979
you have a constant relationship.

564
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:24,339
Your fellowship might be strained,

565
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:29,179
but your relationship is, it remains.

566
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,259
And this morning,

567
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,379
we find that the miracle of Christmas

568
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:39,019
is that we can become the sons of God.

569
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:40,459
It says in verse number seven,

570
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,819
as we continue reading here in this portion of scripture,

571
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:46,779
wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son.

572
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:50,499
And if a son, notice what it says,

573
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:55,019
then an heir of God through Christ.

574
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,419
This is amazing.

575
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:58,139
This is absolutely miraculous.

576
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:00,379
As you begin to understand here this morning,

577
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,019
the truth of Christmas, the miracle of Christmas,

578
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:06,619
and how the Bible tells us that God,

579
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,779
what he did is he sent forth his son.

580
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:11,499
He dispatched the Lord Jesus Christ,

581
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,499
God in flesh came to this earth with a purpose,

582
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:17,019
the purpose to redeem,

583
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:21,619
and we find that he offers to us sonship.

584
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,379
But it's only through the Lord Jesus Christ.

585
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:26,819
You can't become a son any other way.

586
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:29,339
You can't work to become a son.

587
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,419
You can't labor.

588
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:31,299
You can't toil.

589
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:32,979
There's nothing you can do.

590
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:36,499
You have to simply receive his gift that he offers.

591
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:39,619
The Bible says it this way in John one in verse number 12,

592
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,539
but as many as received him,

593
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:44,579
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

594
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,939
even to them that believe on his name.

595
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:51,219
It's interesting in John one in verse 12,

596
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:55,099
how it uses the word received and believe.

597
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,899
We must believe that Jesus is God.

598
00:38:56,899 --> 00:39:00,059
We must recognize that he is who he says he is.

599
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,699
He declared to be God in flesh and he is.

600
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:05,339
We understand this morning that he's sinless.

601
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,739
He's pure and he's holy.

602
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,099
He went to a cruel cross

603
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,099
and he was buried in a borrowed tomb.

604
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,259
He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

605
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:14,859
We must believe that truth.

606
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,339
We must believe that there's no other way to get to heaven.

607
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,699
Today, people are running around

608
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,139
thinking they can get to heaven

609
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:23,219
through some merit of their own.

610
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:25,979
On the authority of God's word, there is no other way.

611
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:29,619
Jesus said this, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

612
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:34,619
It says this, no man cometh unto the father but by me.

613
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:38,939
Peter would declare in the book of Acts

614
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:43,059
as he's standing before the religious leaders,

615
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,259
being questioned for the miracle that took place

616
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,699
with the healing of a lame man.

617
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,499
He says, neither is there salvation in any other.

618
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:52,619
There's no other name under heaven given among men

619
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,579
whereby we must be saved.

620
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,419
What name was Peter referring to?

621
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,659
Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth.

622
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:05,659
God in flesh, and we find here this morning that we must believe those things, but then

623
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:10,339
we must receive that gift that God offers.

624
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:15,719
But as many as received Him, John 1 and verse number 12, to them gave He power to become

625
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,619
the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.

626
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,499
And we receive that gift.

627
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:27,619
See, believing is not simply an intellectual exercise.

628
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,399
There's repentance that's involved.

629
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:34,879
There's a turning away from our sin and from our own ideas about how we can approach God.

630
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:41,519
There's a turn to God and a receiving of this truth that we've preached this morning and

631
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,799
we've believed and then we receive.

632
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,999
And the Bible says that He makes us sons.

633
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:53,079
It says that we are no longer a servant but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through

634
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,079
Christ.

635
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,879
It's absolutely amazing.

636
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:59,679
It's miraculous.

637
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,879
The Bible would tell us this in 1 John chapter 3 and verse number 1.

638
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:11,959
It's a verse of Scripture that I've come to greatly appreciate.

639
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:27,999
In 1 John 3 and verse number 1, when the Bible would say this, behold, what manner

640
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:39,039
of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.

641
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,959
For the world knoweth us not because it knew Him not.

642
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:49,919
You notice the phrase there, behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon

643
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:55,279
us that we should be called the sons of God.

644
00:41:55,279 --> 00:42:00,399
The miracle of Christmas, why is it this morning, I ask this question by way of introduction,

645
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:06,199
why would we say that Christmas is miraculous?

646
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:12,359
What is it about Christmas that would lead me or lead anyone else to say it's miraculous?

647
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:19,559
Why would I title a message and spend a time preaching on the miracle of Christmas?

648
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,199
Because truly when we understand the incarnation, it's miraculous.

649
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,359
Every single aspect.

650
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:37,759
The fact that God loved me so much, that God loved you so much that He sent forth His Son.

651
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:43,679
He gave His only begotten Son.

652
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,759
The virgin birth but then the purpose to redeem.

653
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:58,119
I can't even imagine this morning going through life not knowing this truth.

654
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:04,839
For years of my life we celebrated Christmas.

655
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:13,599
I knew that we celebrated Christmas because of the birth of Jesus but it stopped there.

656
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,759
I didn't understand why He was born.

657
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:18,639
I didn't understand for what purpose He was born.

658
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,519
I didn't even really understand how He was born.

659
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:27,319
I just knew that we sang songs and we talked about Christmas was about Jesus being born.

660
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:34,159
But you know really what it was most about for me was all the gifts and all of the family

661
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,519
and traditions and all that sort of thing.

662
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:43,719
But there was a day in my life when I was 17 years old that I recognized that I was

663
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:49,479
a sinner in need of the only Savior.

664
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:56,559
The one for whose birth, quote unquote, we had celebrated for 17 years.

665
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:05,399
But never really knowing why and all of a sudden I understood the real miracle of Christmas.

666
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:11,999
That God sent forth His Son so that I could be redeemed and I placed my faith and trust

667
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:15,039
in Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.

668
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:21,639
Just a few months later, it was in August when I got saved and the year was 97.

669
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,559
Some of you weren't even alive.

670
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,999
That first Christmas, Christmas of 97, was a Christmas unlike any other Christmas.

671
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,559
Why?

672
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:40,999
Because I had a clear understanding of what Christmas was really all about.

673
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:48,679
And this morning, I hope that as we celebrate, it's Christmas Eve, tomorrow is Christmas.

674
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:55,559
I hope that as we celebrate that we rejoice in knowing the true meaning of Christmas,

675
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,239
the miracle of Christmas.

676
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:08,639
I hope that today, this week, tomorrow as we gather with family and friends that perhaps

677
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:15,079
God would give us an opportunity to speak of the miracle of Christmas.

678
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,799
Because it's nothing short of miraculous.

679
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,259
This morning, if you're saved, if you know the Lord Jesus Christ, I think you'd agree.

680
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:25,479
Nothing short of miraculous.

681
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:30,279
Let us rejoice in the miracle of Christmas.

682
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:36,119
But this morning, if you're not saved, if you don't know for sure if heaven's your home,

683
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:41,279
you say, I knew we celebrated Christmas, I've celebrated Christmas for years, but I never

684
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:43,759
truly understood why.

685
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,999
I didn't understand the implication.

686
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:52,679
I didn't understand that Jesus, God in flesh, came so that I could be saved because I needed

687
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:58,039
a savior because I was lost and because of my sin and because that I'm guilty, I was

688
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,599
headed to a Christless eternity.

689
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,239
Maybe this Christmas could be like that first Christmas for me back in 97 when you truly

690
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,999
realize and recognize the miracle of Christmas.

691
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,879
And you can accept that wonderful gift that God has for you, the gift of God which is

692
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:20,959
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

693
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:26,799
This morning, if you're not sure of heaven, oh, we would beg you to trust Christ this

694
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:27,799
morning.

695
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:29,919
Do not leave this place without knowing for sure.

696
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:39,199
I mean 100% absolute certainty that heaven is your home, that you are a son of God, that

697
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,119
you've been adopted into the family of God, the miracle of Christmas.

698
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,559
We notice in our text of scripture what God did.

699
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,159
We notice how He did it and we notice why He did it.

700
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:54,119
Thank God for the miracle of the incarnation.

701
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,639
Let's pray together.

702
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,319
We love you this morning.

703
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,399
We thank you for loving us.

704
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:10,079
Lord, perhaps this morning there are many that are rejoicing in their salvation.

705
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,479
They know that they've been adopted in the family of God.

706
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:19,119
They're a child of yours, an heir of God through Christ.

707
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,359
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to rejoice.

708
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,839
Help us, Lord, to be vocal about the miracle of Christmas.

709
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:38,439
Lord, perhaps there's one, maybe many, under the sound of my voice this morning that do

710
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:42,759
not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

711
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,319
They've never been saved or born again.

712
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:51,679
God, I pray the Holy Spirit in this moment would convict them of their sin of Christ's

713
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:55,279
righteousness, of judgment to come.

714
00:47:55,279 --> 00:48:00,879
I pray, God, that they would not leave this place without knowing for sure that heaven

715
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:07,399
is their home, that this Christmas would be like no other Christmas they've ever celebrated

716
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:13,039
because they would have the knowledge of the true meaning, the miracle of Christmas.

717
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,999
We pray that you'd have free reign, that you'd move and work as only you can.

718
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:23,559
We'll thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
