00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
Turn the book of Exodus if you will Exodus chapter number 14 Exodus chapter number 14. It's a familiar passage of Scripture

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.039
I trust to be a blessing to you today as I mentioned just a little while ago by during the

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.399
announcements we finished up the book of Colossians and I thoroughly

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.659
enjoyed the opportunity of preaching and teaching through the book of Colossians on Sunday mornings here in

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:28.559
2021 and we finished two weeks ago and I believe the Lord taught us much through our study the book of Colossians and

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:32.459
Next week. We'll begin a brand new study for a new theme for

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.720
2022 and looking forward to the opportunity last week

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.439
Of course, we looked at that passage in John chapter number four when the Lord Jesus Christ went through Samaria

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:46.639
He met that woman at the well and he said to her if thou knewest the gift of God

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:52.279
And I know that we had the opportunity to study that passage. I trust that the Lord has

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.200
Encouraged you by

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Understanding and being a recipient of the greatest gift that's ever been given the gift of God

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.760
Which is eternal life this morning as we look at this passage in Exodus chapter number 14 and really think about the closing of one

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.440
Year and entering into another year. I trust that we'd be encouraged that we'd be strengthened

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.559
We'd be challenged as we look forward to what God has for us. I'm thankful

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.519
then in the midst of all of the chaos and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.319
Confusion that our God remains seated upon his throne and he has a plan and

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.480
I believe that as we look throughout the whole of Scripture that God's instruction to us

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:34.160
As the people of God is that we are to continue and we'll use a phrase throughout the service

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.559
this morning that we find here in Exodus chapter number 14 that we are to go forward and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.839
There's no room for retreat. There's no room for compromise. We can't stay where we are. We can't go back

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:53.239
We must go forward as we look at Exodus chapter number 14 again. It's a very familiar passage of Scripture

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:58.160
In fact, it's here that God tells us about that great miracle of the crossing of the Red Sea

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:05.800
It's interesting to me that as you read the Scriptures you read the entirety of the Bible that this miracle above any other miracle is mentioned

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.360
Over and over throughout the Word of God

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
In fact, you read in the book of Psalms many

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:18.199
References to this period of time when God delivered his people from Egyptian bondage and they crossed over the Red Sea on dry ground

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240
What a great miracle as we think about the many times in which this particular

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.639
Passage in this event is recorded and repeated in the Word of God

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.639
We find really that it serves two purposes

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:37.059
number one to remind us of God's power to remind us of what our God is able to do to remind us of what he

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:43.100
has done and encourage us with what he's able to do we find also that it certainly serves as a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660
As a faith builder

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.380
we often speak about the importance of our faith being increased and you look throughout the Word of God and you find that the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.940
Disciples prayed they asked the Lord to increase their faith. We understand that there are

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:05.940
Representations throughout the Word of God of those that have had their faith increased and we know that faith cometh by hearing and hearing

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.699
From this precious book the Bible the Word of God and I'm so thankful that God has given it to us beginning in verse number

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.259
1 of Exodus 14 the Bible says this and the Lord spake unto Moses saying

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.860
Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamp before pie

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.020
Hi Roth between Migdol and the scene over against Baal Zephon before it shall ye

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.899
Encamp by the sea and so we find here in verse number two that God gave specific

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.059
Instruction with regard to the place in which the children of Israel were to go

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.899
The Bible says in verse number three for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.899
They are entangled in the land

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.139
The wilderness hath shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:55.660
after them and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his host that the

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.179
Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.699
and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.800
People and they said why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving us?

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.940
And he made ready his chariots and took his people with him and he took 600

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.140
chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.179
Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.700
notice in verse number nine

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.420
the Bible says the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen in his army and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.019
Overtook them in camping by the sea beside Piah a high wrath before Baal Zephon

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.700
That's exactly where they were to be according to verse number two

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.500
the Bible says that when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:59.540
Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.140
Verse number 11 records for us what they say to Moses

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.140
It says this and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt that has now taken us away

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500
To die in the wilderness

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:18.459
Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:25.339
Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:29.339
For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:36.540
We should die in the wilderness and we find first of all here the people speak in verses 11 and 12

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.260
We read of the people speaking and really they're speaking against Moses and they are certain that death is imminent

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.579
They of course are in this particular location where God has led them

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:52.380
We understand that before them is the Red Sea, but they see according to verse number 10

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.140
They lifted up their eyes and they beheld the Egyptians marched after them and the Bible says that they were sore afraid

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.339
Their circumstances led them to a place of fear and they speak and they say that it would be better for them

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.339
Had they stayed in Egypt?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.899
We find that Moses speaks in verse number 13 and 14 and the Bible says and Moses said unto the people

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.700
Fear ye not

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.380
Stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.739
For the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.579
Notice this the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:43.579
And so moses the human leader the man that god had chosen to lead the children of israel out of egyptian bondage

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.579
God is now using his man to encourage the people

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.140
He tells them to fear not to stand still to see the salvation of the lord

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.459
He tells them the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.640
But I want to draw your attention to what god says in verse number 15

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.959
We find that the people spoke we find that moses spoke and now the lord speaks

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.839
And notice the bible tells us in verse number 15 and the lord said unto moses

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.459
Wherefore cryest thou unto me?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.679
Notice what he says speak unto the children of israel that they

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.339
go

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.040
forward

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.640
But lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.839
And divide it the children of israel shall go on dry ground through

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.760
the midst

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.760
of the sea

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.440
He said this

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.619
go

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:39.920
forward

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.359
Go forward. We think about this truth and we understand for the children of israel

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:51.040
Contextually speaking in exodus 14 that they were to go forward. They were to cross this red sea

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:56.720
We find that for us as the people of god today, I mentioned already there's no room for retreat

00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:58.480
There's no room for compromise

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.160
We must go forward in fact in hebrews chapter number 10

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:08.799
the word of god teaches us this truth with regard to going forward to making progress to

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.720
Continuing to understand the direction in which we're to go in hebrews chapter number 10

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.679
As that chapter ends and before we get to the great hall of faith chapter

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.140
I want you to see what is said in verses 37 through 39

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:26.000
of hebrews chapter number 10

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.640
The bible says this for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:40.000
He's speaking about the return of our great god and savior the lord. Jesus christ the blessed hope and we have great confidence that

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.520
One day one glorious day. We will hear the trumpet of the lord and we will be here

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:51.280
No longer we'll be caught up to meet the lord in the air and I look forward to that day

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:55.940
Of course, we do not know the hour the day nor the hour of that particular

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.359
Event that will take place but we have great confidence that we know that he will come

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:06.719
Now notice what the bible says in verse number 38 now the just shall live

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:09.200
by faith

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.919
We don't live by sight. We live by faith

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:15.200
But if any man what does it say draw back

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:21.859
If any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him notice in verse number 39

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:26.900
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:32.559
but to them that believe to the saving of the soul and then we enter into

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:39.440
The 11th chapter of the book of hebrews the great hall of faith chapter where the bible tells us of all those great

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:44.799
Victories that were wrought through faith and we understand and we often reference verse number six

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:48.719
But without faith it is impossible to please him

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:55.460
For he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder to them that diligently

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.919
Seek him

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.919
Oh that we as the people of god

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:02.719
would go forward for a few minutes this morning

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:05.059
from the 14th chapter of the book of Exodus.

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:06.379
I want to preach a message

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:09.339
that I've simply entitled from that 15th verse,

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:11.419
Go Forward.

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:12.719
Go forward.

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:14.519
Four questions that we'll use

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.559
by way of points this morning.

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.219
The first question is this,

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:21.679
why do we go forward?

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.759
Why is it that we should go forward?

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.799
Why is it that the children of Israel,

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:27.559
given the circumstances,

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.179
the situation in which they face,

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:31.139
why do we go forward?

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:32.559
Why do they go forward?

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:35.219
Why today in 2021,

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.559
why is it that I would preach this message?

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:40.019
Why is it that we should have this thought

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:42.599
that we are to go forward?

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.219
In one word, the answer is this,

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:46.919
obedience.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.719
Obedience.

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:49.879
Why do we go forward?

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:53.559
We go forward because we obey the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:56.379
We go forward, the children of Israel are to go forward.

00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:57.219
Why?

00:10:57.219 --> 00:10:58.799
Because God spoke.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.799
We find that the people said,

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.119
in verses 11 and 12,

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.159
we've mentioned it by way of introduction,

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.499
to understand the fear and the trembling

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:09.159
of the people of God,

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.459
the children of Israel.

00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:13.239
They said it had been better had they stayed in Egypt

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.119
than that they should die in the wilderness.

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:16.639
And Moses speaks,

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:18.839
and I'm thankful for the leadership of Moses

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:21.919
and the faith of Moses when he says stand still.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.519
Fear ye not, stand still,

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.539
and see the salvation of the Lord.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.759
For the Lord shall fight for you.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:30.179
And ye shall hold your peace.

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:31.679
I'm thankful for his faith.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:36.419
But we go forward because God speaks.

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:39.479
I'm thankful for the leadership of Moses.

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:41.079
I'm thankful for what Moses said.

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:43.519
But you understand that Moses said stand still

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.319
and see the salvation of the Lord.

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:46.959
And I believe he had great faith

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.399
that God was going to work,

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:51.699
but they went forward as a matter of obedience

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:53.759
because of what God said.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.999
Because in verse number 15,

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:55.839
the Bible says,

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.079
the Lord said unto Moses,

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.159
wherefore, cryest thou unto Me,

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:02.799
speak unto the children of Israel

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:06.559
that they go forward.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.479
It's a matter of obedience.

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:10.839
We so often speak about obedience,

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:13.079
we sing songs about obedience,

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:14.279
trust and obey,

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:17.599
for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:19.439
but to trust and obey.

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:22.599
Obedience is the very best way to show what?

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:23.959
That you believe.

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.879
Doing exactly what the Lord commands,

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:28.759
doing it happily.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:31.679
And we find that often as we think about the Word of God

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:33.639
and we understand throughout the Scriptures

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:37.839
that God has placed a premium on obedience,

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.319
we see it here in Exodus chapter number 14,

00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:43.199
why is it that they should go forward?

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:45.519
Was it because collectively they got together

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.919
and they devised a plan?

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:49.559
Was it because of some other event

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:51.839
or some circumstance or some great idea?

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:54.959
No, it was because of obedience.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.759
It's a matter of obedience.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:58.439
Turn to the New Testament and think about us

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:00.359
for New Testament believers,

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.039
the book of Matthew.

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:03.519
Matthew chapter number 28,

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:06.119
it's a familiar passage of Scripture,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.239
but I want to remind you this morning

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:10.759
that we read and look to this passage of Scripture

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:12.719
because we as a church,

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:15.719
and I speak not just of Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:17.719
but as the people of God,

00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:19.079
the church of God,

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.199
we've not yet fulfilled all

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:24.319
that this passage of Scripture has commanded us to do

00:13:24.319 --> 00:13:26.559
when we think about the importance of missions

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.119
and preaching the Gospel

00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:29.879
and taking it to all the world.

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:32.639
The Bible says this in Matthew chapter 28,

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:35.559
before the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.639
in verse number 18,

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:39.479
and Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:44.479
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:49.639
Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:52.159
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:54.839
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.279
teaching them to observe all things

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:00.679
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:02.879
And lo, I am with you all way,

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:06.079
even unto the end of the world.

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:07.879
Amen.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.879
The reality is that oftentimes

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:11.799
as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:14.079
we mentioned the Great Commission

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.839
and how important the Great Commission is.

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:19.999
And we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:23.599
His last commandment that He gave us

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:27.279
before He ascended to heaven continues,

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:31.959
remains to be the mission of the church today.

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:35.839
If we lose our focus, if we lose our mission,

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.479
if we lose our purpose,

00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:41.239
yes, it's to exalt and to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:43.599
but we find it in John, the Bible says,

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:48.599
herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit.

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:51.839
And we must be about the Father's business.

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:54.479
We must be about obedience to this command.

00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:56.359
Why is it that we go forward

00:14:56.359 --> 00:14:59.319
with carrying the gospel to a lost and dying world?

00:14:59.319 --> 00:15:01.759
It's a matter of obedience.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:04.239
It's not because we've received some phone call

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:06.519
from some city council member that has said,

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:08.999
would you please go into the community

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:11.119
and give them the truth of the gospel?

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.479
That'd be very interesting if we received a phone call

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.279
such as that, would it not?

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.839
But the reality is that we do not go forward

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.999
because of the request of some elected official,

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:25.159
some politician, we go forward because of the command

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.479
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:28.999
It's a matter of obedience.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.359
We find it in Philippians,

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:33.159
turn over to the book of Philippians, if you will,

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:37.319
in chapter number three, Philippians chapter number three,

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:39.959
and you look in these verses of scripture here

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:41.679
in verses 12 through 14,

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:44.159
and I want you to consider the thought

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:47.339
and the perspective of the apostle Paul

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:49.959
as he gives it here in this passage of scripture.

00:15:50.359 --> 00:15:52.879
We find that he says this in Philippians three

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.399
in verse number 12,

00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:58.839
not as though I had already attained,

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:02.119
either were already perfect,

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:06.519
but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.359
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:15.999
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:18.039
but this one thing I do,

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.159
forgetting those things which are behind

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:23.959
and reaching forth unto those things which are before.

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:25.759
Notice what he says in verse number 14,

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:29.759
I press toward the mark for the prize

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:34.119
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:38.999
This is a testimony of a man who desires to go forward

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.679
for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:45.679
a man that recognizes that I've not yet apprehended,

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:49.319
that I have a desire that I may apprehend that

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:52.119
for which also I am apprehended

00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:53.239
according to verse number 12,

00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:55.599
but he says I've not yet apprehended,

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:56.879
and so what do I do?

00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:00.039
He says this at the end of verse number 13,

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:03.159
reaching forth unto those things which are before,

00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:04.119
and how does he do it?

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.959
I press toward the mark for the prize

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:12.419
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:16.739
Often as we read the examples of the apostle Paul

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:18.939
as God would use him to write scripture,

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:22.579
we find that there are two really analogies

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.379
that he uses of the Christian life

00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:27.379
regularly throughout the pages of scripture

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.779
that God would use him to pen.

00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:31.059
One is that of a soldier

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:35.739
and the importance of being a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

00:17:35.739 --> 00:17:37.899
but another analogy that he uses

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:40.859
is that of a really an athlete,

00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:43.179
and he speaks of some athletic terms,

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:47.939
and here no doubt there's a perspective of athletics

00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:51.739
and pressing toward the mark for the prize

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:54.859
and thinking about reaching for that finish line,

00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:58.499
if you will, that goal to get to that place,

00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:00.779
and we find that as the people of God,

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.719
we must go forward.

00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:06.699
What was it that compelled Paul to have this perspective?

00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:09.699
Why is it that he had this desire to go forward?

00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:11.499
No doubt it was out of obedience.

00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:13.739
God had placed a call upon his life.

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:16.819
God had given him a purpose and a vision

00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:18.619
and a reason for living,

00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:21.899
and we find that he wanted to go forward.

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:24.739
In 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.899
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:28.799
and we find that it's in this passage,

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.219
really in the book of 2 Timothy,

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:32.019
where Paul is writing

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:34.859
and he's about to be martyred for his faith.

00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:38.139
He speaks of that specifically in the fourth chapter,

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:40.380
but in the third chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.899
he's speaking about these last days,

00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:46.339
and he's giving a glimpse into the time

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:50.500
in which the last days and how they'll be described,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.299
and we find that no doubt,

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:54.820
as you read the beginning of 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.339
many of these descriptive terms

00:18:57.339 --> 00:19:00.219
that are used to describe the last days

00:19:00.219 --> 00:19:02.539
and the perilous times that shall come

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:05.459
are prevalent in our day in which we live.

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:09.619
And Paul says to Timothy in verse number 14,

00:19:10.779 --> 00:19:12.659
but continue thou.

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:15.399
Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:17.000
and hast been assured of,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.700
knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:22.859
I understand that the phrase go forward

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:25.219
is not found in that verse of scripture,

00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:28.739
but I feel as we think about this truth of continue,

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:32.979
he's not telling him to just kind of hole up

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:36.700
and mount up and get ready and just stay where you are

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.659
or to retreat.

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:40.099
No, he tells him to continue.

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.419
The idea of going forward, making progress.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:44.159
There's a work to be done.

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:47.659
And so why is it that we go forward?

00:19:47.659 --> 00:19:50.539
Why should the children of Israel respond?

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.219
And here in Exodus chapter number 14,

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:56.619
it's a matter of obedience.

00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:58.299
Let me ask this question, number two,

00:19:58.299 --> 00:19:59.260
if you're taking notes.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.099
Not only why.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:05.499
do we go forward? But number two, how? How do we go forward? How do we go forward?

00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:09.819
You say, well that's easy, you put one foot in front of the other. I want you to

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.859
think about the situation, the circumstances of the children of Israel

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:18.819
back in Exodus chapter number 14. Again, it's a familiar passage of Scripture. I've

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:23.419
preached from Exodus 14 in the past and no doubt you've read it, you've heard

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:27.659
people preach from it. It's a great passage of Scripture, a great victory

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:31.699
that was wrought for the children of Israel, but I want you to consider their

00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:36.339
circumstances. And they're there in that place, Pi-hahiroth, as the Bible tells us,

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:42.179
and they were led to that place. And the Egyptians were gonna have the

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:47.379
perspective that they were entangled in the land, that there was no way for them

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:52.059
to get out, they were trapped, and thus the the Egyptians would be able to to be

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:56.979
victorious. But we find that as we look at the circumstances, that before them

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:05.259
is the Red Sea. Behind them they've seen, they lifted up their eyes according to

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:10.019
verse number 10, and they saw the Egyptians coming. All the host of the

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:18.379
Egyptians. So you got the Red Sea and you have the Egyptians. Go forward. Go forward.

00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:22.339
It's a matter of obedience. Why do we go forward? We go forward because of

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:28.579
obedience. But how do we go forward? We go forward by faith. We go forward by

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:34.059
faith. We find that here, as we look at this passage of Scripture in Exodus

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:39.259
chapter number 14, they had to believe God. They had to believe that it would

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:44.299
happen just as He said it would happen. Notice in Exodus chapter number 14, the

00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:49.819
Bible says in verse number 15, that the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore criest

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:55.899
thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward. Lift thou

00:21:55.899 --> 00:22:02.019
up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it. And the

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:08.739
children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. I've

00:22:08.739 --> 00:22:12.099
heard people say that it didn't require much faith on the part of the children

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:17.859
of Israel because God parted the Red Sea before they walked into the dry ground

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:22.539
and to pass over the Red Sea. And they've peddled the idea that it took

00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:27.259
more faith for the children of Israel to cross over the Jordan because they had

00:22:27.259 --> 00:22:32.099
to take a step in before the waters were parted. I would submit to you that it's

00:22:32.099 --> 00:22:35.579
really the same level of faith because when they saw the walls of water on

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:39.819
either side of them when they were going to enter into the Red Sea, it required a

00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:43.859
great deal of faith to believe that God would continue to hold those walls of

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:49.819
water back for them to cross to the other side. It's a matter of faith.

00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:55.179
Believing God, believing that not only could God do it but that God would

00:22:55.179 --> 00:23:01.339
provide them safety for the entirety of the passage, that until they reached the

00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:06.899
other side that they would have the the safety and the ability to cross over. The

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:11.299
Bible tells us as we move forward further through here in Exodus chapter

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:18.339
14 that they passed over on dry ground. It's amazing, phenomenal, but it's by

00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:26.579
faith. It's by faith. We go forward. Why? Because of obedience. How? By faith. In

00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:31.619
Matthew chapter number 16 and verse number 18 we find that Jesus gives this

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:37.299
great promise to Peter and he says, upon this rock I will build my church. He

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:41.739
tells him that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. When we think

00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:46.459
about the the importance of us as New Testament believers going forward, we

00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:50.019
understand that it's a matter of obedience but we also understand that

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:54.659
it's a matter of faith that God has given us the marching orders and we are

00:23:54.659 --> 00:24:00.739
going in obedience but we're trusting him to do what only he can do. We go by

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:06.299
faith. The just shall live by faith. We go by faith believing that God will use his

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:13.099
Word. Believing that the truth that God has given us within the Word of God is

00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:17.899
effective on reaching the generation that God has given us the responsibility

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:23.779
to minister to. Our God is eternal. He is all-knowing and we find that he's given

00:24:23.779 --> 00:24:29.739
us a book and he's given us a plan and we're to simply follow the plan that

00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:35.939
he's given us and by faith we trust him to do what only he can do. So often today

00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:41.099
we find and I would not suggest this morning that there's absolutely no use

00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:46.019
in any of these types of sessions or seminars for no doubt I've gained some

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:51.219
some good ideas and insight but so often it seems as if we sit around and we try

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:55.899
to scheme and device plans on how it is that we're going to reach the current

00:24:55.899 --> 00:25:00.099
generation that God has given us to minister to and all the while that we

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:04.459
sit around and we come up with ideas and we seek to figure out how to do it we

00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:11.179
simply never actually do it and the importance is to follow what God has

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:17.139
said we can spend days and weeks and hours upon hours upon hours trying to

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:22.099
come up with ideas but God said that we're to go we're to preach the gospel

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:27.019
we believe as Paul said in Romans chapter number one I'm not ashamed of

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:32.339
the gospel of Christ why for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:36.859
that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek we believe that the Bible

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:42.099
tells us in Hebrews chapter 7 in verse number 25 that he is able to save them

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:47.859
to the uttermost the gospel still works we don't need to change the methodology

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:52.619
we don't need to change the message we find that as we take the message of God

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:57.539
in the power of God first Corinthians tells us that he's chosen the

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:05.019
foolishness of preaching why so that no flesh would glory in his sight and we

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:10.439
find that we live in this time in this age in which we must have faith as we go

00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:16.619
forward in in obedience that we have faith that God is going to work and God

00:26:16.619 --> 00:26:24.339
is going to move that he is able to do what only he can do and he'll use us

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:29.179
familiar passage of Scripture in 1st Corinthians 15 as we look at this

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:33.819
passage in 1st Corinthians 15 we're reminded of the great truth of the

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:38.539
resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ how he conquered sin death

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:42.819
in the grave it is the cornerstone of our faith and it's in this 15th chapter

00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:47.299
of the book of 1st Corinthians that you find that really the the greatest

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:51.019
information given to us in one place of Scripture with regard to the

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:56.299
resurrection and the hope that we have as the people of God that we too will be

00:26:56.299 --> 00:27:03.019
resurrected why because he is the firstfruits we find that that he is the

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:08.579
firstfruits and we too will rise this mortal shall put on immortality this

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:13.659
corruption shall put on incorruption and how we rejoice in that but because we

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:20.139
serve a risen Savior we go in faith believing that he is able to do and able

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:24.699
to work as only he can notice as the passage of Scripture concludes in verse

00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:32.219
number 58 in 1st Corinthians 15 and 58 the Bible says this therefore my beloved

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:42.859
brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as

00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:52.779
much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord there are times in

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:59.219
which we examine the circumstance of the situation we say is God working the

00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:03.019
truth of the matter is that if we continue to sow the seeds of the Word of

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:08.099
God and we continue to give the gospel we continue to go forth and and and do

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:13.739
what God has called us to do the answer is yes God is working we may not see how

00:28:13.739 --> 00:28:18.659
God is working we may not see it today but we can have great hope and we can

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:28.219
have great confidence because why we go in faith sowing our seeds the seeds of

00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:34.819
the gospel the Word of God believing that God is able to work in the hearts

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:40.979
and the minds of those that receive the truth of the Word of God I think of the

00:28:40.979 --> 00:28:46.179
farmer as the analogy is used so often in the Word of God the farmer that

00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:53.579
plants his seed he too plants his seed in faith believing that a crop a harvest

00:28:53.579 --> 00:29:00.139
will one day come I've never been a farmer I'm not the son of a farmer I

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:06.539
probably wouldn't survive long if I were a farmer just being honest Pierre can

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:12.779
relate we talked about it a few times over the years but the reality is this I

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:17.500
don't find as I've had interaction and seen various things I don't find that a

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.380
farmer goes out and sows his seed and then every day goes out wringing his

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:29.179
hands wondering where the harvest is why isn't it here today well why isn't it

00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:35.219
coming up I don't see anything I need to dig it up and start over what if he

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:40.859
does that he's never gonna have a harvest he's gonna continue to destroy

00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:45.299
what's taking place and and what's going on with the germination of the seed and

00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:50.179
the growth of that plant and all that takes place and if he day by day goes

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:54.779
out and says nothing's happening I need to dig it up and start again he's never

00:29:54.779 --> 00:30:01.659
gonna have a harvest but he has faith that he planted that seed

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:04.979
And then in a little while,

00:30:04.979 --> 00:30:07.739
he'll start to see the seed sprout.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:10.599
He'll see that life.

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:12.299
A little while longer,

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:14.699
you see the growth and you see the progress,

00:30:14.699 --> 00:30:19.479
and soon it will be time for harvest.

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:21.239
And for us as the people of God,

00:30:21.239 --> 00:30:23.739
as we go forth and we sow seed

00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:26.039
and we go by faith believing

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:27.379
that God is working,

00:30:27.379 --> 00:30:29.299
believing that He's able to do

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:30.719
what only He can do,

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:33.119
and we're going forward, why?

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:34.199
Because of obedience.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.699
How? By faith.

00:30:37.699 --> 00:30:42.839
We live in a very results-oriented culture.

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:43.919
We understand that.

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:46.719
We live in this culture.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:49.079
And so often, we're results-oriented

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.319
and if we're not careful,

00:30:50.319 --> 00:30:53.439
we can become very pragmatic.

00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:57.199
And we can miss this element of faith.

00:30:57.199 --> 00:30:59.279
But we understand that we go forward

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:01.359
how? By faith.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.559
Believing that the work that we're doing,

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:05.259
the work that we're engaged in,

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:08.159
is a spiritual work.

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.959
And the Holy Spirit of God is moving

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:11.999
and working and using His Word.

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:14.119
Why is it that Paul tells Timothy

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:17.599
to continue in the things that thou hast learned

00:31:17.599 --> 00:31:18.999
and hast been assured of?

00:31:18.999 --> 00:31:21.119
He didn't tell him that in those last days

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.119
you're going to change all of your methodology,

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:24.239
you're going to change your message,

00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:25.519
you're going to change all these things.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:27.559
No, in fact, as you enter into the fourth chapter,

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:30.359
he says, preach the Word.

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:31.999
Be instant in season, out of season,

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.519
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering

00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:36.359
and doctrine, for the time will come

00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:40.119
when they will not endure sound doctrine.

00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:42.039
And we find that, yeah, no doubt,

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:44.039
we're in that place, we're in that time.

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:48.359
And the reality is that God has still ordained

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:50.799
preaching.

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.799
The preaching of His Word.

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.839
The sowing of the seed.

00:31:54.839 --> 00:31:56.359
And how is it that we go forward?

00:31:56.359 --> 00:31:58.839
We go forward by faith.

00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:02.559
Philippians 1.6 says this,

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:05.279
being confident of this very thing,

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:08.599
that he which hath begun a good work in you

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:12.879
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:14.959
Being confident.

00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:17.359
I'm thankful for the work that God is doing

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.159
in me and in you,

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:21.759
and trusting that He will continue to do

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:25.479
what only He can do in our lives.

00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:27.399
When we think about this truth of go forward,

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:29.039
we say, why do we go forward?

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:30.479
Well, it's a matter of obedience.

00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:31.879
How do we go forward?

00:32:31.879 --> 00:32:33.639
It's by faith.

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:36.119
Let me ask this question, number three.

00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:39.119
What hinders us from going forward?

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:41.559
What hinders us from going forward?

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.599
No doubt, if we'd be honest this morning,

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:46.039
there are hindrances in our lives,

00:32:46.039 --> 00:32:48.359
there are hindrances to going forward.

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:49.959
The children of Israel,

00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:53.519
there's a great big red sea in front of them.

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:56.559
And God says, go forward.

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:59.559
There's a body of water.

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:01.719
It's an obstacle. It's a hindrance.

00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:04.679
But God's going to deal with that.

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:07.279
But sometimes what happens in our lives

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:11.159
is we have these obstacles or these hindrances

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:13.559
and we fail to go forward. Why?

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:16.199
Because we're looking by sight and not by faith.

00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:18.439
And we say, well, there's no way to go forward.

00:33:18.439 --> 00:33:20.039
It's impossible to go forward.

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:23.479
I can't go forward.

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:26.639
But God says, go forward.

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:30.319
How? By faith.

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:33.039
What hinders me from going forward?

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:38.719
I would say this, doubt. Doubt.

00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:45.479
Several years ago, it was in 2017

00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:47.239
that our theme for the year was

00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:50.359
Increase Our Faith.

00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:52.399
And through the year of 2017,

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.999
I preached a number of messages

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.999
on those things that God would use

00:33:56.999 --> 00:33:58.679
from His Word to increase our faith.

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:00.999
We looked at examples of individuals

00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:03.839
that had their faith increase

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:06.399
through the events in their lives.

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:08.079
And I said this often

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.919
in that particular calendar year,

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.999
and it's worth repeating this morning,

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:14.559
that if faith is a flower,

00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:17.439
then doubt is a weed.

00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:18.599
And what do weeds do?

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.439
They choke out the life of the flowers.

00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:22.919
We need to get rid of the weeds.

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:24.759
If we want our flower beds to grow,

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:27.599
and we want our flowers to grow

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.319
and to have that beauty,

00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:30.519
we get rid of weeds.

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:31.639
Why do we pick weeds?

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.759
Why do we spend time?

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:35.599
And all of the things that are out there

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:38.679
the marketing industry has provided us with

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.199
to deal with weeds, why?

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:43.919
Because they choke out the life of the flower.

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:46.359
And if faith is a flower,

00:34:46.359 --> 00:34:48.559
then doubt is a weed.

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:51.919
We must get rid of doubt.

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:54.599
Someone said this,

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:56.719
never put a question mark

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.999
where God has put a period.

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:01.279
Never put a question mark

00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:03.399
where God has put a period.

00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:05.399
But the problem sometimes in our life

00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:08.079
is that we have doubts.

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.559
How's this going to work?

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:11.039
What's going to happen?

00:35:11.039 --> 00:35:12.679
I can't see the way.

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:17.439
But again, doubt is the enemy of faith.

00:35:17.439 --> 00:35:20.039
And if we go forward in obedience

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:21.519
and by faith,

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.599
when we acknowledge that there's times

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.999
in which we are hindered from going forward,

00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:28.079
that one of those hindrances to going forward

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.679
is doubt.

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:32.239
How's it going to work out?

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.359
How's this going to work?

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:35.959
Doubt.

00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:41.079
God asked Moses in Numbers chapter 14,

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.199
how long will it be,

00:35:42.199 --> 00:35:44.879
are my people believe me?

00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:46.759
You know, God wants us to have faith.

00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:48.919
He wants us to live by faith.

00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:50.879
He doesn't want us to doubt Him.

00:35:50.879 --> 00:35:52.879
He wants us to trust Him.

00:35:52.879 --> 00:35:54.559
What hinders us from going forward?

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:57.319
Not only doubt, but I'd say this, fear.

00:35:57.319 --> 00:35:58.359
Fear.

00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:00.799
Fear of the unknown.

00:36:00.799 --> 00:36:04.879
Fear of failing.

00:36:04.879 --> 00:36:07.559
If I go forward, I might fail.

00:36:07.559 --> 00:36:09.159
Jesus never fails.

00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:10.879
If we know that we're going forward

00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:12.799
at His command, at His direction,

00:36:12.799 --> 00:36:14.519
at His instruction,

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:15.639
it's a matter of obedience,

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.959
we need not to fear failure.

00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:20.039
We need not to fear the uncertainties.

00:36:20.039 --> 00:36:22.399
We find that throughout the Word of God,

00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:24.679
we find over and over and over

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:27.239
this phrase, fear not.

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:29.399
Fear not.

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:33.919
He's not given us a spirit of fear.

00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:36.079
He's not given us a spirit of fear,

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:39.119
but yet we find that one thing

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.279
that would hinder us from going forward

00:36:41.279 --> 00:36:43.039
is fear.

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.439
I could say this, what hinders us

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:45.719
from going forward at times

00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:47.759
is influence.

00:36:47.759 --> 00:36:49.359
Influence.

00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.359
Who's influencing us?

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:51.559
Who are we going to listen to?

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:52.799
In the passage of Scripture

00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:55.159
that we have here before us this morning

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:56.159
in Exodus 14,

00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:58.359
we've already noted that the people spoke,

00:36:58.359 --> 00:37:00.319
Moses spoke, and the Lord spoke.

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:02.519
There are times in which we will listen

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:03.879
to the influence of others.

00:37:03.879 --> 00:37:05.439
We'll listen to what other people say.

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:06.959
It doesn't work anymore.

00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:07.919
You can't do that.

00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:10.679
You can't do this.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:11.839
But if we're going forward

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:14.559
at the command of the Lord,

00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.119
then we need not be influenced

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:17.519
by anybody else.

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:19.119
Think about the nation of Israel.

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.599
They had been given the instruction.

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:21.759
Of course, we understand that

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:24.159
as we fast forward from this particular event

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.399
and this time in Israel's history

00:37:26.399 --> 00:37:28.279
that they had the responsibility

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.599
of going into the land.

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:30.839
It was there in Numbers 14

00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:32.159
that I mentioned just a moment ago

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:33.279
when God said to Moses,

00:37:33.279 --> 00:37:34.639
how long will it be

00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:35.959
ere my people believe them?

00:37:35.959 --> 00:37:37.199
It's within the context

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:39.439
of the spies being sent out.

00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:42.039
In chapters 13 and 14 of the book of Numbers,

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:44.639
God has Moses take 12 spies

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:46.159
and send them into the land

00:37:46.159 --> 00:37:47.759
to see what's there.

00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:50.399
What the land is.

00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:52.319
To bring back a report.

00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:54.199
And we know the account and we're familiar.

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:55.559
We sing songs with children

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:57.759
about 12 men went to spy on Canaan,

00:37:57.759 --> 00:38:00.119
10 were bad and 2 were good.

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:02.159
And those 10 came back with an evil report.

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:04.079
It was a report that was full of doubt

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.719
and fear and uncertainty.

00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:07.159
We be not able.

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:08.679
The people are too great for us.

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:12.719
We have fortified walls.

00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:14.999
But Joshua and Caleb,

00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:18.879
they had a faith.

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.199
Yeah, they didn't deny the existence

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:25.039
of the walled cities.

00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:26.439
They didn't deny the existence

00:38:26.439 --> 00:38:28.239
of the giants.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:29.879
They didn't deny the existence

00:38:29.879 --> 00:38:32.239
of the difficulties and the obstacles,

00:38:32.239 --> 00:38:33.839
but what they understood

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:37.440
is that God told us to go into the land.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.119
And we're going by faith.

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:41.000
We're going in obedience.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.759
And we're trusting that God will do

00:38:43.759 --> 00:38:45.599
what only God can do.

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:52.479
If God is with us, we are able.

00:38:52.479 --> 00:38:54.639
But the influence of those 10 spies

00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:58.039
was great, was it not?

00:38:58.039 --> 00:39:00.079
What did the entire congregation want to do?

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:01.679
Well, first of all, they were going to

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:04.479
stone Joshua and Caleb.

00:39:04.479 --> 00:39:06.079
But they were going to make themselves captains

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:09.119
and go back to Egypt.

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.519
It wasn't the only time, by the way,

00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:12.399
that they murmured and complained

00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:17.039
and thought about going back to Egypt.

00:39:17.039 --> 00:39:18.839
The influence.

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:22.279
God says go forward.

00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:24.039
What hinders us from going forward?

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:26.199
Doubt and fear and influence,

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:31.959
uncertainty, obstacles.

00:39:31.959 --> 00:39:33.479
But let me ask this final question

00:39:33.879 --> 00:39:36.039
as we conclude our message.

00:39:36.039 --> 00:39:39.359
What happens when we go forward?

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:40.599
Why do we go forward?

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:42.399
We go forward because of obedience.

00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:44.039
It's a matter of obedience.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:47.879
We go forward because God said go forward.

00:39:47.879 --> 00:39:48.879
How do we go forward?

00:39:48.879 --> 00:39:50.879
We go forward by faith.

00:39:50.879 --> 00:39:52.479
Believing that God will do

00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:54.559
what only God can do.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.279
Moses could not part that Red Sea.

00:39:57.279 --> 00:40:00.000
The children of Israel could not part that Red Sea.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.719
There was nothing within their power

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:11.079
to provide them safe passage across that Red Sea, but God could. How? By faith.

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:14.679
What hinders? No doubt there are many things that could hinder the children of

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:19.159
Israel from going forward. In their history, as we've made note just a moment

00:40:19.159 --> 00:40:23.639
ago, there are many times in which they were hindered from going forward because

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:29.039
of a variety of things. But what happens when we go forward? Well, go back to

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:35.119
Exodus 14. We find the instruction from God in verses 15 and 16 that they're to

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:40.039
go forward. I want you to skip down, if you will, in verse number 21. It says this,

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:46.239
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. And that was at the direction of

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:50.399
God. In verse 16, he says, Lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over

00:40:50.399 --> 00:40:55.079
the sea. And it says in verse 21 that Moses stretched out his hand over the

00:40:55.079 --> 00:41:00.759
sea. Notice what the Bible says, And the Lord caused the sea to go back by a

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:08.879
strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were

00:41:08.879 --> 00:41:16.459
divided. All that night, God caused that strong east wind to come and he made the

00:41:16.459 --> 00:41:22.479
sea dry land and the waters were divided. Man, don't you wish

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:27.639
you could have seen this? I mean, what miracle, what power of God that's

00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:34.039
displayed. And we find that Moses acted in obedience. He took what God told

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:40.039
him to do and he obeyed God. He had seen God work in his life. The plagues

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:46.359
have already taken place and Moses had seen God work. He had experienced the

00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:51.759
power of God and he holds out that rod at the command of God. And the Bible says

00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:57.159
that God moved and God worked. And the Bible tells us in verse number 22, notice

00:41:57.159 --> 00:42:05.679
what it says, And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the

00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:13.639
dry ground. You know what they did? They went forward. They went forward. God said

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:19.519
in verse number 15, Go forward. In verse number 22, the Bible says, And the

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:27.639
children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground. Notice

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:32.119
the Bible says, And the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and

00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:39.799
on their left. This isn't just a group of like 12 or 70 people. It's a large host

00:42:39.799 --> 00:42:46.079
of people that are crossing over, perhaps as many as a couple million, and they're

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:50.959
crossing over the Red Sea on dry ground. And the Bible says that there was a wall,

00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:55.439
the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left. Can

00:42:55.439 --> 00:43:02.359
you imagine crossing over on dry ground? Man, this is miraculous. This is exciting.

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:07.719
What happens when we go forward? We get to see what God can do when we go

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:12.719
forward. They just sit there and say, Well, Moses, I understand God said to go

00:43:12.759 --> 00:43:16.119
forward, but really, if you look at the situation, there's nowhere to go forward.

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:19.399
We're just going to hunker down here and we're going to hope for the best. We're

00:43:19.399 --> 00:43:25.079
going to hope that... God said, Go forward. And in verse number 22, the Bible tells

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:31.519
us that they went into, they go forward, they went into the midst of the sea upon

00:43:31.519 --> 00:43:43.239
the dry ground. Man, how exciting to see what God can do. The Egyptians were not told

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:52.779
to go forward, but they did. They looked at the situation and they said, Well, look, man,

00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:56.679
if they all crossed over on dry ground and they got to the other side, let us pursue

00:43:56.679 --> 00:44:04.839
after them. Verse 23 tells us the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst

00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:10.239
of the sea. Even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, they didn't have

00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:14.679
the same command that God had given the children of Israel. And it didn't work out as good

00:44:14.679 --> 00:44:20.239
for them as it did for the children of Israel. Because when they got in the midst of the

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:27.719
Red Sea, God caused their chariot wheels to fall off. They draved them heavily. And

00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:34.719
then God told Moses to raise up his rod and he, God, caused the sea to return. And the

00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:42.599
Egyptians were destroyed. The people of God at the command of God by inobedience and by

00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:47.879
faith, not being hindered by all of those things that could hinder them, what happens

00:44:47.879 --> 00:44:53.479
is they get to see God work. They get to see God move and work. It tells us in verse

00:44:53.479 --> 00:45:02.479
number 29, But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and

00:45:02.479 --> 00:45:07.399
the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the Lord

00:45:07.399 --> 00:45:14.679
saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. Man, they walked on dry land. You

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:22.159
think they talked about this? Of course they talked about this. The Scriptures speak much.

00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:26.639
I mentioned already by way of introduction that this event, the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:45:26.639 --> 00:45:32.759
is often spoke of within the Word of God. The Psalms very regularly reference the crossing

00:45:32.759 --> 00:45:38.959
of the Red Sea. In chapter number 15, here in Exodus, you see the song of Moses and the

00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:45.839
deliverance and how they're rejoicing and how they're just amazed at what God has done.

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:55.679
It's miraculous. What happens when we go forward? We get to see God work. We get to see God

00:45:55.679 --> 00:46:03.439
work. The psalmist said in Psalm 119, It is time, O Lord, for thee to work. You see God

00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:11.479
work. And when is it that we see God work? When we go forward in obedience by faith.

00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:15.999
I would say this, what happens when we go forward, not only do we get to see God work,

00:46:15.999 --> 00:46:22.799
but I would say that we have our faith increased. Our faith is increased as we go forward. Yes,

00:46:22.799 --> 00:46:27.659
because we see God work, but let me say this, and we're actually going to look at an example

00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:31.979
of this this evening. I hope that you tune in again tonight as we look at an example

00:46:31.979 --> 00:46:38.339
of this very truth in Exodus chapter number 17. But I want to say this, what happens when

00:46:38.339 --> 00:46:45.219
we go forward, there's this idea, and it's really a false idea, that if we go forward

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:50.819
in obedience and by faith that everything's just going to be perfect. It doesn't work

00:46:50.819 --> 00:47:01.259
that way. You know why? Oftentimes, our faith is increased through obstacles and difficulties.

00:47:01.259 --> 00:47:07.059
It's the obstacles and the difficulties when we go forward that actually result in our

00:47:07.059 --> 00:47:14.299
faith being increased. In chapter 15, at the end of the chapter, as they are crossed over

00:47:14.299 --> 00:47:19.019
and they've seen the victory, they've seen the hand of God work, they say, Who is like

00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:23.859
unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in

00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:29.979
praises, doing wonders? I mean, they're rejoicing, and then you come to the end and there's not

00:47:29.979 --> 00:47:41.939
water that's drinkable. It's bitter water. It's an obstacle. We came here at your command.

00:47:41.939 --> 00:47:49.259
Unfortunately, they responded off in how we respond to obstacles, in disbelief and in

00:47:49.259 --> 00:47:57.899
doubt and in uncertainty and regret. Why are we here? We're going to die. But that obstacle

00:47:57.899 --> 00:48:04.819
in chapter number 15, at the end, the first trial after their deliverance, we find that

00:48:04.819 --> 00:48:12.139
those waters were bitter, and God healed those waters. God healed those waters, and they

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:18.939
were sustained. It's interesting to me that you read in chapter number 16, the entirety

00:48:18.939 --> 00:48:27.459
of the chapter deals with the manna. How did the chapter begin? Well, it begins with

00:48:27.459 --> 00:48:33.979
murmuring and complaining because there's no food, because they're hungry. The obstacle

00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:40.619
turned to a great faith builder, where God says through Moses, the instruction is given

00:48:40.619 --> 00:48:44.679
with regard to going out and gathering the manna, and I would submit to you that day

00:48:44.679 --> 00:48:52.399
by day as they would go out and they would get that manna, that that was a faith builder.

00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:57.919
I preached a message from this passage a couple of years ago on a Wednesday evening from Exodus

00:48:57.919 --> 00:49:04.159
16, and I titled it this way, Would You Have Passed the Test? Would You Have Passed the

00:49:04.159 --> 00:49:11.439
Test? Because just as some of them gathered more than they were supposed to, I would submit

00:49:11.439 --> 00:49:17.159
to you that in 2021, some of us would gather more than we were supposed to as well, because

00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:21.719
we wouldn't have faith that it'd be there tomorrow. And what happened? It bred worms

00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:30.959
and it stank. And so then, when they're supposed to gather twice as much on the sixth day,

00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:35.919
they decided that they'd only take enough for that day because it bred worms and stank,

00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:41.519
and so therefore I need to get it fresh tomorrow, and they did not find it tomorrow, because

00:49:41.519 --> 00:49:50.679
God said gather twice as much on that sixth day. And what happened? It stayed, and it

00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:56.719
was good for them. They could eat it. It was a faith builder. It was an obstacle. See,

00:49:56.719 --> 00:50:01.599
what happens when we go forward, there's this idea that exists amongst humans that if we

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:04.739
go forward in obedience and by faith,

00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:07.519
that that just means everything's gonna be blissful

00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:09.959
and perfect and we're never gonna have a problem

00:50:09.959 --> 00:50:12.759
and everything's just gonna be wonderful.

00:50:14.319 --> 00:50:18.579
And when an obstacle comes, when a difficulty arises,

00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:21.139
we all of a sudden begin to second guess

00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:22.819
why we're where we are.

00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:30.559
But we find that throughout the Scriptures

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:32.919
and even here in this passage that we're dealing with

00:50:32.919 --> 00:50:36.559
this morning in Exodus 14 when he says go forward,

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.199
that their faith would be increased

00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:40.559
and it would be increased often

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.659
through obstacles and difficulties.

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.139
Through obstacles and difficulties.

00:50:47.139 --> 00:50:49.799
I'm thankful this morning that as we go forward

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:51.919
we get to see God work.

00:50:51.919 --> 00:50:54.079
I'm thankful this morning that as we go forward

00:50:54.079 --> 00:50:56.679
that he increases our faith.

00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:58.279
And often he increases our faith

00:50:58.279 --> 00:51:00.559
through difficulties and obstacles.

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.999
And so as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:51:02.999 --> 00:51:05.679
in Exodus 14 and we make some parallels

00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:07.479
to the New Testament believer,

00:51:07.479 --> 00:51:09.439
I would say to you this morning,

00:51:09.439 --> 00:51:12.159
let's determine to live by faith and go forward.

00:51:12.999 --> 00:51:14.279
We can't stay here.

00:51:14.279 --> 00:51:15.499
We can't go back.

00:51:15.499 --> 00:51:17.119
We must go forward.

00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:18.439
We must go forward.

00:51:19.399 --> 00:51:21.299
And why do we go forward?

00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:24.159
Because we've been commanded to.

00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:25.999
We go forward in obedience.

00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:30.639
Go and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:32.519
The marching orders of the church.

00:51:33.439 --> 00:51:34.879
It's our responsibility.

00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:35.719
How?

00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:37.499
How do we go forward?

00:51:37.499 --> 00:51:38.359
Not by sight.

00:51:38.359 --> 00:51:39.859
We go forward by faith.

00:51:40.759 --> 00:51:42.119
Believing that God will work.

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:45.639
Believing that God will do what only God can do.

00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:50.639
That yes, he'll use us as co-laborers with God.

00:51:51.319 --> 00:51:54.079
And what a blessing it is to be a co-laborer with God.

00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:57.879
Let us be aware that there are some things

00:51:57.879 --> 00:52:00.159
that will hinder us from going forward.

00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:01.559
No doubt.

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:03.799
There are hindrances to going forward.

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:06.119
There are obstacles.

00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:08.339
There are voices, influences.

00:52:08.339 --> 00:52:09.179
There's doubt.

00:52:09.179 --> 00:52:09.999
There's fear.

00:52:09.999 --> 00:52:12.039
There's all sorts of things that would hinder us

00:52:12.039 --> 00:52:13.039
from going forward.

00:52:13.039 --> 00:52:16.679
But let us focus upon what happens when we go forward

00:52:16.679 --> 00:52:18.519
is that we get to see God work.

00:52:19.399 --> 00:52:23.339
They obeyed God and they walked on dry ground.

00:52:24.439 --> 00:52:26.599
And they got to the other side.

00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:27.519
What a blessing.

00:52:28.719 --> 00:52:29.819
God said,

00:52:31.199 --> 00:52:36.199
speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward.

00:52:36.919 --> 00:52:39.759
This morning, we need to go forward.

00:52:39.759 --> 00:52:40.579
Let's pray together.

00:52:40.579 --> 00:52:41.719
Father, we love you.

00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:45.159
We thank you for loving us.

00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:47.559
We thank you for the opportunity to study your word.

00:52:47.559 --> 00:52:49.319
And we thank you for the passage of scripture

00:52:49.319 --> 00:52:50.159
that is before us.

00:52:50.159 --> 00:52:53.559
Again, a familiar passage of scripture in Exodus 14

00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:57.199
in dealing with this event that is so well known to us,

00:52:57.199 --> 00:53:00.799
the crossing, the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea.

00:53:00.799 --> 00:53:03.039
We thank you for how you worked and moved

00:53:03.039 --> 00:53:07.719
and how you gave direction and how you provided a way.

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:10.239
We thank you for your deliverance

00:53:10.239 --> 00:53:11.799
that is seen for the children of Israel

00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:13.699
here in this passage of scripture.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.999
As we make application for our lives today,

00:53:19.999 --> 00:53:24.079
as we close 2021, this last Sunday of the year,

00:53:25.239 --> 00:53:28.039
God, I pray that you'd help us to go forward.

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:33.799
Help us to understand that it's a matter of obedience.

00:53:33.799 --> 00:53:36.879
Help us to understand that we must go forward in faith.

00:53:39.399 --> 00:53:40.999
Help us not to be hindered.

00:53:43.999 --> 00:53:45.199
God, we wanna see you work.

00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:47.119
We long to see you work.

00:53:49.519 --> 00:53:52.879
We know that you're able to do exceeding abundantly

00:53:52.879 --> 00:53:54.959
above all that we ask or think.

00:53:54.959 --> 00:53:58.279
We thank you for the ways in which we have seen you work

00:53:58.279 --> 00:54:01.919
in our midst, even in this past year,

00:54:01.919 --> 00:54:04.839
in our lives personally, in our church corporately,

00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:07.679
how we praise thee and how we thank thee

00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:08.899
for what you've done.

00:54:11.399 --> 00:54:14.739
But God, we must go forward at your command,

00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:16.399
at your instruction.

00:54:16.399 --> 00:54:18.219
And I pray that you'd help us.

00:54:19.919 --> 00:54:21.279
Onward, forward.

00:54:24.879 --> 00:54:25.879
Would you help us, Lord?

00:54:25.879 --> 00:54:27.479
Move and work as only you can.

00:54:27.479 --> 00:54:29.679
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:54:29.679 --> 00:54:31.279
We'll have a time of invitation.
