1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,099
So we're gonna look at the first eight verses

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:06,159
of this chapter, be the context for our study this evening.

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:07,800
Of course, you know in the book of 1 Timothy

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,159
that the Apostle Paul is writing to Timothy,

5
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,420
his son in the faith.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,000
Timothy would be a pastor.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,159
He was going to, of course, serve in the ministry.

8
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:20,319
Timothy often was sent from place to place.

9
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,200
The Apostle Paul mentioned to the church at Philippi

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,479
that he was gonna send Timotheus unto them.

11
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:28,659
We find that Paul mentioned, of course,

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,139
to the church at Thessalonica

13
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,020
that when he couldn't go to visit them

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,540
to find out their estate, who did he send?

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,860
He sent Timotheus.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,540
And so Timothy was his son in the faith.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,619
Timothy served the Lord faithfully.

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,580
And these two epistles, 1 and 2 Timothy,

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,099
we find that Paul is writing to Timothy,

20
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,939
seeking to encourage him,

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,500
and of course, to give him instruction.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
And in 1 Timothy, chapter number two,

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,860
we find that the Bible says,

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,380
I exhort therefore that first of all,

25
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,020
supplications, prayers, intercessions,

26
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,819
and giving of thanks be made for all men,

27
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,660
for kings and for all that are in authority,

28
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,419
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

29
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,860
in all godliness and honesty.

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,379
For this is good and acceptable

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,300
in the sight of God our Savior,

32
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,940
who will have all men to be saved

33
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,220
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

34
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,019
For there's one God and one mediator

35
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:24,419
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

36
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,900
who gave Himself a ransom for all

37
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,660
to be testified in due time,

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,059
whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

39
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,459
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not,

40
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:41,019
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

41
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:45,300
Verse 8, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

42
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,099
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

43
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,540
It's interesting as we look at this passage of Scripture

44
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,900
and see the place of prayer,

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,980
the title for the message this evening

46
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,019
is Prayer as Our First Response.

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,059
Prayer as Our First Response.

48
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:05,819
We understand as Bible-believing Christians,

49
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,980
we understand the place of prayer in our lives.

50
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,460
We understand the privilege of prayer.

51
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,539
We often speak about what a wonderful privilege it is

52
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,139
that we can go to God in prayer,

53
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,339
we can go to God at any time for any reason.

54
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,619
We often quote, many of us have memorized

55
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:24,740
a certain number of prayer promises from the Word of God.

56
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,460
Call unto me and I will answer thee

57
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
and show thee great and mighty things

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,179
which thou knowest not, Jeremiah 33 in verse number three.

59
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:36,100
And we memorize and rehearse Ephesians 3.20,

60
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,380
now unto him which is able to do exceeding abundantly

61
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,220
above all that we ask or think.

62
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,100
We understand James 5, the effectual fervent prayer

63
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,179
of a righteous man availeth much.

64
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:48,619
We understand Hebrews 4 in verse number 16,

65
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,380
let us come boldly unto the throne of grace.

66
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,820
And we go through these verses of Scripture,

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,940
we understand the great privilege of prayer.

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,339
And sometimes, unfortunately,

69
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,419
though we know all of those things,

70
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,380
at times in our lives, prayer, if we'd be honest,

71
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,660
is not our first response.

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,539
Amen?

73
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,020
I'm preaching to myself, but I'm also trying to help you.

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,660
Because I know in my life, in the 20 plus years

75
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,220
that I've been saved and walking with the Lord,

76
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,419
I have understood, I have been taught,

77
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,580
I have studied, I have preached,

78
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,259
I have taught on the subject matter of prayer.

79
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,580
But one of the most challenging things

80
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,380
in the Christian discipline,

81
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,419
if I could use that terminology, is prayer.

82
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,979
We find that many people,

83
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,220
I've spoken with many people over the years,

84
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,539
I've spoken to people in ministry,

85
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,899
I've spoken to people in churches,

86
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:47,460
and I've had interaction with those

87
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,460
that have sought to how can I have an improved prayer life?

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,220
Why is it that it seems like my prayer life

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,419
isn't what it should be?

90
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,699
There are people that struggle with prayer.

91
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,419
I know that for many,

92
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,779
as we would enter into our time of prayer,

93
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,740
and I should say that it is important

94
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,580
that we have a time of prayer.

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,699
Yes, we're to pray without ceasing.

96
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,139
As we understand, Paul tells the believers

97
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,339
in Thessalonica,

98
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,380
and that's important that we understand that truth

99
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,339
to always be in that spirit of praying

100
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,260
and understand that we can enter into His presence.

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,700
But we understand there ought to be a set time

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,059
that we enter into our prayer closet.

103
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,700
We understand that we don't pray as the Pharisees.

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,940
Remember, Jesus said of those that they have their reward,

105
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,260
the applause of man.

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,299
But the privilege of prayer is a distinct privilege

107
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,500
for the child of God.

108
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,140
And as a child of God,

109
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,779
I have this privilege to go to my heavenly Father

110
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:52,500
at any time for any reason.

111
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,859
That's amazing.

112
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,260
The God of the universe,

113
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,700
we speak about the Lord,

114
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,140
we speak about the fact that He is Creator,

115
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,260
He is Redeemer, He is our Father,

116
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,299
He is our refuge, He is our shield, our buckler.

117
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:09,459
I mean, we understand His power and His wisdom,

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
and we understand the availability that we have,

119
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,820
the privilege to enter in His presence,

120
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,619
but at times, we simply fail to seek His face.

121
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,100
At times in our lives,

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,100
we simply cannot say that prayer is our first response.

123
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,859
In fact, there are times in our lives

124
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,420
that we've tried all sorts of things.

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,100
We've read books.

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,899
We've asked friends.

127
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,940
We've sought counsel.

128
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,940
And after we've failed and we've found no solution,

129
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,100
we say something like this,

130
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,019
maybe we should pray about it.

131
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,540
It's interesting, the disciples asked the Lord,

132
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,700
it's recorded in Luke 11, in verse number one,

133
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,660
they said this very simply,

134
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,059
teach us to pray.

135
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,739
Teach us to pray.

136
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,779
We understand that there's a model prayer.

137
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,459
Our Father, which art in heaven,

138
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,940
hallowed be Thy name.

139
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,420
I won't recite all of it,

140
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,739
but we understand there's a model prayer.

141
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:09,420
Then there's the prayer of Jesus,

142
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,579
the prayer of Christ in John 17.

143
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,100
And we understand that Jesus often

144
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,140
went into a remote place for the purpose of prayer.

145
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,619
Some have questioned, why is it if Jesus is God,

146
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:26,899
why would He have to go and pray to God?

147
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,940
He is God.

148
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,299
We understand that He is the 100% man.

149
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,579
He's 100% God.

150
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,579
The incarnation, the truth of that amazing miracle

151
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,299
that God took on human flesh.

152
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,339
And He came to earth,

153
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,899
but we find that through His earthly ministry,

154
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,660
as He would often resort hither

155
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,500
for the purpose of prayer,

156
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,420
that not only was He having that communion

157
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,380
with the Father,

158
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,500
but we find that He was leaving an example for us.

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
In fact, Peter would say later

160
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,779
that we are to follow His steps,

161
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,420
that Jesus left us an example

162
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,059
that we should follow His steps.

163
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,899
But the disciples say in Luke 11, 1,

164
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,980
Lord, teach us to pray.

165
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,339
I want to read to you a definition.

166
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,140
This is a Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary

167
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,500
definition of prayer.

168
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,019
Now, we would understand,

169
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,459
as I read this definition to you of the word prayer

170
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,579
in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828,

171
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:31,739
we would understand how influential the Bible was

172
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,420
on the definitions of that time.

173
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,940
Here's the definition.

174
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,820
It says, here's what prayer is.

175
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,820
In worship, a solemn address to the supreme being,

176
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:48,299
to God, consisting of adoration

177
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:52,660
or an expression of our sense of God's glorious perfections.

178
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,339
Number two, confession of our sins.

179
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,299
Number three, supplication for mercy and forgiveness.

180
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:03,019
Number four, intercession for blessings on others.

181
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,019
And number five, thanksgiving

182
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,779
or an expression of gratitude to God

183
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,420
for His mercies and benefits.

184
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,059
That's a great definition.

185
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,459
I believe that prayer is the most obvious expression

186
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,019
of our dependence upon God.

187
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,980
In fact, when I fail to pray,

188
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,859
in essence, I'm saying I can handle it myself.

189
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,779
I'm sufficient at this.

190
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,820
Whatever the task might be.

191
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
But we find that as Paul is writing to Timothy

192
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
and he's giving him this exhortation,

193
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,580
he tells him in verse number one,

194
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,780
I exhort, therefore, notice the priority of prayer.

195
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,940
He says, I exhort, therefore, that first of all,

196
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,179
we're gonna notice as we go through the text of Scripture,

197
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,260
I don't really have a bunch of points this evening,

198
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,659
we're just gonna walk through the passage of Scripture,

199
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,260
but I want you to notice the priority

200
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,340
that is placed upon prayer.

201
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,419
The Apostle Paul is giving this exhortation

202
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,380
and he says to Timothy, he says,

203
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,659
this exhortation that I'm bringing to you,

204
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,979
he says, I exhort, therefore, that first of all,

205
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,780
he's placing this priority,

206
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,299
the place of prayer in the life of,

207
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,299
yes, Timothy, as a church leader,

208
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,460
but we could understand the application

209
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,140
for every child of God and the importance of,

210
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,419
even as we've used for our title this evening,

211
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,380
prayer as our first response.

212
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,299
I referenced James 5,

213
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,020
the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

214
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,700
Prior to that verse of Scripture,

215
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,859
we find the Bible says if any are sick, let them pray.

216
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:43,179
Again, the first response.

217
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:46,539
We find that the description of prayer is given.

218
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,700
It's interesting how verse number one of 1 Timothy 2

219
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,859
lines up so closely with the definition of Noah Webster

220
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,940
in his 1828 edition of the dictionary.

221
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,140
Again, no doubt of the influence of.

222
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,940
Scripture upon that definition. Notice the description that is given. I exhort

223
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,940
therefore that first of all, he breaks it into four categories. Supplications,

224
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,740
specifically making a request for a need. There are times as God's people that we

225
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,500
need things. If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God which giveth to all men

226
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,660
liberally and upbraideth not. I recognize in my life on a regular basis, and I hope

227
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,980
that you recognize in your life on a regular basis, that I need wisdom. There

228
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,420
are times we need direction for our life. I'm so thankful that God is able to

229
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,260
provide the direction that we need for our life. He's able to give us wisdom.

230
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,980
There are times that we need certain things. Remember, our God knows what we

231
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:51,220
have need of. By the way, sometimes what we consider a need is really just a want.

232
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,660
But we find that here, supplications, it's making requests for need, prayers,

233
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:04,180
the idea of this broadly used term there would simply give us the understanding

234
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,180
of direct communication with God. Aren't you thankful that you can go direct to

235
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,700
God? The God of the universe. The God who said, let there be light, and there was

236
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:21,940
light. The God who parted the Red Sea, parted the Jordan that sent fire from

237
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,780
heaven. I mean, we could go through all of the miracles, and we could understand in

238
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,100
the gospel records the wonderful miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we

239
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:38,140
could understand that we can go directly to God in prayer. Intercessions. The

240
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,860
ministry of intercessory prayer is such an important ministry. It's praying for

241
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,220
or on behalf of another. You know it's a blessing to know that someone's praying

242
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:56,300
for you? It really is. It's a blessing when somebody says to you, I'm praying

243
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,820
for you. I like to add to that when somebody says I'm praying for you, and

244
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,980
here's how I'm praying for you. That's even an extra benefit of blessing

245
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,740
because we know what they're praying for us specifically in a specific way. By the

246
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,340
way, as Christian people, as brothers and sisters in Christ, we have the unique

247
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,260
opportunity to go into the ministry of intercessory prayer and pray on the

248
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,340
behalf of one another. What a joy. You know it's exciting when you know that

249
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,260
scores of people are praying for you? What comfort that brings. Speaking to a

250
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,460
pastor friend not many months ago, and as I was speaking with him, there was a

251
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,420
family situation they were dealing with and we were praying for them and I

252
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,460
wanted to let him know I didn't send him a text every single day and multiple

253
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,980
times throughout the day, but occasionally as the Lord would lay it

254
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,860
upon my heart, I would reach out let him know that we were praying for him and I

255
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,340
would let him know specifically how we were praying. And on one particular

256
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,460
occasion he replied back and he let me know just the the wonderful report and

257
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,420
testimony of what was happening and he said that we are convinced that this is

258
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,660
the direct result of so many people that are praying for us. He said I'm getting

259
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,220
text messages and emails and phone calls from pastor friends, from church members,

260
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,380
from missionaries and evangelists all over the world that they're praying for

261
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:35,180
us. That's encouraging. What a blessing. He says not only supplications, prayers,

262
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,460
intercessions, notice giving of thanks. Our God is worthy in everything give

263
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,620
thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Sometimes

264
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,540
we might find it difficult in certain circumstances to give thanks, but we must

265
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,660
understand that our God has a purpose. We must understand that his purpose is far

266
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,140
greater than our convenience. See at times we might have a difficulty giving

267
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,020
thanks for a circumstance because quite honestly I don't like the circumstance.

268
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,660
But it might be in that circumstance that God is going to be glorified in a

269
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,620
way that he could not otherwise be glorified. I think of Paul. He wrote to

270
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,580
the church at Philippi from prison. One of the most joyful books that you can

271
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,540
read in all of the Bible and he's writing from prison. I think of Paul and

272
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,620
Silas when they are at Philippi. Remember what was happening? They were beaten,

273
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,260
accused, and they were imprisoned. But what were they doing at midnight? They were

274
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,740
singing and praising God. No wonder when that jail cell broke open because of the

275
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,060
earthquake that that jailer after the initial conversation with Paul said,

276
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:59,700
sirs, what must I do to be saved? See we find that there's a priority on prayer.

277
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,940
He says, first of all, there's the description that is given, supplications,

278
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,740
prayers, intercessions, giving of thanks, notice for whom we are to pray. He says

279
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,820
at the end of verse number one, giving of thanks be made for all men. He continues

280
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,700
into verse number two, for kings and for all that are in authority, for whom we

281
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,300
are to pray. It's interesting that he specifically notes the kings and for all

282
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,420
that are in authority. We don't have a king in our nation. We understand at the

283
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,500
time of this writing that the Emperor Nero was ruling and reigning. What a

284
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,460
wicked man. You read history, you understand some things of Nero and the

285
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,020
persecution and all that was going on. And we find here that the Apostle Paul

286
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:53,100
is saying to Timothy about this priority of prayer, about the description,

287
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
and he says here's who you need to pray for. Notice you're to pray for kings and

288
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,980
for all that are in authority. I'll be honest with you, very transparent with

289
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,420
you, it's a lot easier for me to pray for you than it is to pray for those in

290
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:16,420
authority. It really is. But we have a biblical responsibility to pray for

291
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,700
those who are in authority. That we would understand that it is not given to us,

292
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,180
and again as we understand contextually, historically, at the time of the writing

293
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,500
that Nero was the one in power, it does not matter whether I agree with the

294
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,220
individual that's in the office. It's a biblical mandate that we pray for them.

295
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:41,500
And it's interesting as we find this truth of whom we are to pray for. Yes, we

296
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,180
understand that we're to pray for our brethren and be engaged in that ministry

297
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,820
of intercessory prayer, and what a blessing that is. But to think that we're

298
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,180
to pray for kings and for all that are in authority, and we notice the impact, it

299
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,540
says this at the end of verse number two, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable

300
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:05,700
life in all godliness and honesty. The impact of following the admonition that

301
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,340
is given, we find that this impact is something that we would desire. The

302
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:17,220
result of obedience to this instruction that is given is a desired result. It's

303
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,980
certainly we would want to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and

304
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,780
honesty. I wonder this evening if some of our elected officials were to enter

305
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,500
into our presence, if we could look at them and honestly before God and before

306
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,540
man say, I've prayed for you. A biblical responsibility. We find here that the

307
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,500
Bible tells us as we continue the thought of the impact, it says in verse

308
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,540
number three, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our

309
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,260
Savior. You know, anytime we find in the Word of God something that God tells us

310
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,740
is good and acceptable to Him, we ought to take note. In like fashion, if we find

311
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,020
something that the Bible specifically says that did not please God, we ought to

312
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,300
take note. Because these are behaviors that we want to ensure are in our lives,

313
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,500
and we find that it was in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10 that as

314
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,780
Paul is given truth to the believers in Corinth and he's using Old Testament

315
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,660
example, and he goes through a whole list of examples and he says with many of

316
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,740
them God was not well pleased. And then he begins to give the examples. Okay, take

317
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,300
note. Take a pen out and begin to understand, okay, this is behavior that

318
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,739
does not please God. But we find specifically here that the Bible says

319
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:42,660
that this, what Paul is dealing with contextually, the subject matter of

320
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,940
prayer, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. You know

321
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,100
that our God delights in answering prayer? He is a prayer answering God. He

322
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,460
said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and

323
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,340
mighty things which thou knowest not. We understand that our God is a prayer

324
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:13,619
answering God. And he is pleased when we go before his presence and seek his

325
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,299
face, when we spend that time in prayer. By the way, one thing that I think is

326
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,980
dangerous for us in 2020, living in the generation that we're living in,

327
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:31,540
sometimes we think that praying is not as effective as doing. Because sometimes

328
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,780
we think if I just do, do, do, do, and I do all of these things, that that's gonna

329
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,859
provide more result. The reality is that we ought to spend more time in prayer. I

330
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:45,420
use the example of the one cutting down a tree. Now, without a chainsaw, now if you

331
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,540
have a chainsaw and you have a chain that's not sharpened, that can be quite

332
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,460
frustrating as well. But I'm thinking about cutting down a tree with an axe.

333
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,940
You know, the man that would understand the role

334
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,980
of cutting down a tree

335
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,820
and using an axe to do so,

336
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,400
would understand the importance

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,320
of taking time to sharpen his tool.

338
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
Because the sharper his axe,

339
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,100
the more effective he could be

340
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,700
on cutting down that tree.

341
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,460
Truthfully, as we would understand

342
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,880
the passage of Scripture

343
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,380
and the power of prayer,

344
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,820
we should spend more time praying

345
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,060
before we go out door-knocking.

346
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,700
Sometimes, we just pray for just a quick moment,

347
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,140
and then we go out in our own efforts.

348
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,020
See, the ministry of prayer.

349
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,540
We see it in the life of the disciples

350
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,000
and we understand that Peter deals with this

351
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,220
of course, in Acts 5

352
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,060
and dealing with those things that are going on

353
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,300
there in chapter 6.

354
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,860
And he talks about the fact

355
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,180
that they would give themselves continually

356
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,780
to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.

357
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,460
But see, unfortunately, sometimes

358
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,020
in our society today,

359
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,660
we do not place the proper value upon prayer.

360
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,980
If someone were to ask me,

361
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,459
what did you do last Tuesday?

362
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,700
I said, well, I spent three hours in prayer.

363
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,620
That's all you did?

364
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,340
Oh, but if we spent three hours in prayer,

365
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,940
how effective that would be.

366
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,220
And see, sometimes our thinking

367
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,500
is just not where it ought to be.

368
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,779
Because we think that we have minimized prayer

369
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,380
and we have taken the approach

370
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,700
of what we can do in our efforts.

371
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,380
Oh, how we need God.

372
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,480
We find here, that as we think about the impact,

373
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,700
that it's good and acceptable

374
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,400
in the sight of God our Savior.

375
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,060
Notice, in verses four through seven,

376
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,020
really there's a parenthetical thought,

377
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,500
but there's great Bible truth that is given to us.

378
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,980
And let's go through it and see what Paul is saying.

379
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,620
Notice he says this,

380
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,180
in this parenthetical thought,

381
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,020
he begins with revealing really a general will of God.

382
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,300
It says, who, speaking of God still,

383
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,180
will have all men to be saved

384
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,860
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

385
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,699
Isn't that wonderful?

386
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,860
Two-fold purpose, if you consider the general will of God

387
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,900
as it's revealed here in verse number four.

388
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,940
Number one, that mankind would be saved.

389
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,339
The Bible teaches us that God is not willing

390
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:23,460
that any should perish,

391
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,699
but that all should come to repentance.

392
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:26,820
And we find here that it says,

393
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,699
who will have all men to be saved,

394
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,139
not only to be saved,

395
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:35,619
but we find to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

396
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,699
We'd understand as we would look at the Great Commission

397
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:40,380
and we would understand the truth

398
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,100
of the entirety of the Great Commission,

399
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,500
not only of preaching the gospel

400
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
and baptizing the believers,

401
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,860
but then teaching them all things whatsoever.

402
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,300
I have commanded thee in the ministry of discipleship

403
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,400
and that training and that instruction.

404
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,119
And we find that Paul here reveals

405
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,720
this general will of God,

406
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,080
that all men would be saved

407
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,919
and come unto the knowledge of the truth.

408
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,839
This is revealed and made evidence through verse number six

409
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,880
where the Bible says,

410
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,880
who gave himself a ransom for all

411
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,440
to be testified in due time.

412
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,800
Speaking, of course, in verse number six of Jesus

413
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,360
as we look at in verse number five,

414
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,800
but we think about the ransom that was given,

415
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,080
the fact that Jesus Christ went to the cross of Calvary.

416
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,320
He shed His precious blood for your sin

417
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,760
and for my sin and the sin of the world.

418
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,320
And we'd find that as we look at these verses of Scripture

419
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,400
and we'd understand in verse four and six

420
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,520
as this parenthetical thought deals

421
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,839
with the general will of God for mankind to be saved,

422
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,559
for God so loved the world

423
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
that He gave His only begotten Son

424
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,940
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,

425
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,080
but have everlasting life.

426
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,559
Notice, not only does Paul give us

427
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,520
this general will of God,

428
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
but we find that in verse number five

429
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,040
that he shares with us the truth

430
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,600
that the Lord Jesus Christ is our mediator.

431
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,839
By the way, there is no other person

432
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,839
that can fill the role of mediator.

433
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,779
There's no priest, there's no anybody

434
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:12,880
that can fill this role

435
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,639
for we find this truth in verse number five,

436
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:18,679
for there is one God and one mediator

437
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,679
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

438
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,640
Now as we look at this truth in verse number five,

439
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
we understand there is one God.

440
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,959
We've often made the statement

441
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:33,239
and we understand the biblical truth

442
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,179
that Jesus Christ is God,

443
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,320
that He came and He manifested the Father

444
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,420
unto the people.

445
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,080
We look at His life and ministry

446
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,959
and the gospel records,

447
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:47,279
but we find that this ministry of Him being our mediator

448
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,760
was accomplished how?

449
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,160
It was made possible through His substitutionary atonement

450
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,119
and His glorious resurrection.

451
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,279
We understand that as we read the book of Hebrews

452
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,080
in chapter number nine,

453
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,200
if you take a moment to just turn over

454
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,760
to the book of Hebrews and look in the ninth chapter,

455
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,179
we'll also mention a verse over in the 12th chapter,

456
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:08,320
but we find here right in the midst

457
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
of this text of Scripture in Hebrews 9 and 10

458
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,959
dealing with the substitutionary work

459
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,640
of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

460
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,920
And of course, throughout the book of Hebrews,

461
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,559
some of which we've already studied

462
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,799
on our Sunday morning messages

463
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,760
through the first six chapters now,

464
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,360
we have found the work that was accomplished

465
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,399
and the benefits of Christ's work at the cross of Calvary,

466
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,279
what was accomplished through that.

467
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,760
We notice here specifically in verse 15 and 16 of Hebrews 9,

468
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,640
it says, and for this cause,

469
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,480
He is the mediator of the New Testament.

470
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,399
Let's back up and get it in context.

471
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,720
Look in verse number 11,

472
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,839
but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come

473
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,519
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,

474
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,760
not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,

475
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,799
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

476
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
but by His own blood,

477
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,720
He entered in once into the holy place,

478
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,880
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

479
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,600
Isn't that wonderful?

480
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,119
Verse 13, for if the blood of bulls and of goats

481
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,519
and the ashes of an heifer,

482
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,440
sprinkling the unclean sanctified

483
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
through the purifying of the flesh,

484
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,559
how much more shall the blood of Christ

485
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,519
who through the eternal spirit

486
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,920
offered himself without spot to God,

487
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,519
purge your conscience from dead works

488
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,920
to serve the living God.

489
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,320
And for this cause,

490
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,839
He is the mediator of the New Testament

491
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,160
that by means of death,

492
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,320
for the redemption of the transgressions

493
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,279
that were under the first Testament,

494
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,920
they which are called might receive

495
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,679
the promise of eternal inheritance

496
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,399
for where a Testament is,

497
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:53,399
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.

498
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,959
We find that in chapter number 12 in verse number 24,

499
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:00,160
the Bible says this with regard to the subject matter

500
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,080
of the Lord Jesus Christ being the mediator.

501
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,679
The Bible says unto Jesus,

502
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,959
the mediator of the new covenant

503
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,440
and to the blood of sprinkling

504
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,080
that speaketh better things than that of Abel.

505
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm thankful that I can go to God

506
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,119
at any time through the Lord Jesus Christ

507
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,559
that He is the mediator.

508
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,040
There's one God and one mediator

509
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,160
between man and God,

510
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
the man, Christ Jesus,

511
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
between God and man, excuse me,

512
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,440
the man, Christ Jesus.

513
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,399
We find that Paul as he continues this thought

514
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,080
of sharing things in this parenthetical thought,

515
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,959
he then deals with his own call upon his own life

516
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,160
in verse number seven.

517
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,160
He says where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

518
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,320
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not.

519
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,559
A teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

520
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,559
You find that the apostle Paul is referencing once again

521
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,679
as he does often throughout the epistles that he writes

522
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,959
the call that God placed upon his life.

523
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,600
Remember when the apostle Paul was Saul

524
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,040
and he was on the road to Damascus

525
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
and this is recorded in Acts nine.

526
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,000
He says, who art thou Lord?

527
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And then he says, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

528
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,519
And we find that in that passage of scripture

529
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,399
a little while later in Acts chapter nine

530
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,559
that he is given instruction.

531
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,440
It was the responsibility of Ananias to come.

532
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,080
And he says, brother Saul in verse number 17,

533
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,239
the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way

534
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,840
as thou comest hath sent me

535
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,599
that thou mightest receive thy sight

536
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,119
and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

537
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,080
Look at what the Lord says to Ananias

538
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,840
with regard to this one Saul,

539
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,799
because Ananias of course had some concerns

540
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,119
about going to Saul.

541
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,559
He had heard about the authority that he had

542
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,679
and about his testimony.

543
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,320
And he says, go thy way in verse 15 and 16

544
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,919
for he is a chosen vessel unto me

545
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:03,599
to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings

546
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,919
and the children of Israel

547
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,280
for I will show him how great things he must suffer

548
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,200
for my namesake.

549
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,440
It's an amazing truth in verse number 20

550
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,559
that he preached Christ in the synagogue

551
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,960
that he is the Son of God.

552
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,000
The same one that in the beginning of the passage of Acts nine

553
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
he is going with the authority with letters

554
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,599
to go to the synagogues

555
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,400
that if he found any of that way,

556
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,159
those that were followers of Christ,

557
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,720
that whether they were men or women

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,559
that he could bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

559
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,960
Paul shares it this way in the book of Galatians

560
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,840
as he's speaking to those

561
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,799
and speaking about his testimony.

562
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,720
He says this in verse number 15

563
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,760
understanding his own call to the ministry.

564
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720
I'll actually back up to verse number 11.

565
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
Paul says this in Galatians one in verse 11,

566
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,599
but I certify you brethren

567
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,679
that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.

568
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
For I neither received it of man

569
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,359
neither was I taught it

570
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,640
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

571
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,220
For you have heard of my conversation in time past

572
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,480
in the Jews' religion,

573
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,900
how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God

574
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,640
and wasted it,

575
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,180
and profited in the Jews' religion

576
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
above many my equals in mine own nation,

577
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,100
being more exceedingly zealous

578
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,560
of the traditions of my fathers.

579
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,060
But when it pleased God,

580
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,720
who separated me from my mother's womb

581
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,440
and called me by His grace

582
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,680
to reveal His Son in me,

583
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,220
that I might preach Him among the heathen,

584
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,640
immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood."

585
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,840
Notice it's interesting,

586
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,380
we could read the entirety of the text,

587
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,260
but skip down to verse number 23.

588
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
It says this,

589
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,720
but they had heard only

590
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,380
that He which persecuted us in times past

591
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,380
now preacheth the faith which once He destroyed.

592
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,940
See, Paul understood his calling

593
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,460
and he says here to Timothy

594
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,020
as he's giving this truth of this parenthetical thought

595
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,480
that is given to us in verses four through seven,

596
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
he says,

597
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,320
whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

598
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,700
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not,

599
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,340
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

600
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,020
He often would refer to himself

601
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,420
as being the apostle to the Gentiles,

602
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,380
to the uncircumcision,

603
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,140
whereas Peter would be the apostle,

604
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,600
if you will, to the circumcision.

605
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,260
He makes that note in Galatians 2

606
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,220
in verse seven and eight,

607
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
but contrary wise,

608
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,340
when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision

609
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,580
was committed unto me

610
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,140
as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter.

611
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,260
And we understand that Peter initially

612
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,860
was the one that went to the household of Cornelius.

613
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,820
We could read that in Acts chapter number 10 and 11.

614
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,860
And what a blessing that Peter obeyed the Lord

615
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,260
and he took the gospel

616
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,820
and as he comes to the household of Cornelius,

617
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,740
they're sitting and waiting to receive the message

618
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,100
and they're saved and God works in an amazing way.

619
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,220
But then Peter's main emphasis and main ministry,

620
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,660
if you will, would be to the Jews,

621
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,500
whereas Paul would have his ministry to the Gentiles.

622
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,940
That terminology used of circumcision and uncircumcision

623
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,300
referring to those two groups of people.

624
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,020
He says in faith and verity,

625
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,260
that word often we use and speak of it as being truth

626
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,700
and thinking about the truth of the Word of God

627
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,540
and the preaching of the gospel.

628
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,340
As we get to verse number eight,

629
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,540
we find that Paul will now return to the original thought

630
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,020
of verses one through three

631
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,460
here in 1 Timothy chapter number two.

632
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,020
Remember, he's speaking about the importance of prayer.

633
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,060
He's dealing with prayer as our first response.

634
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,060
He says, first of all, I exhort therefore that first of all

635
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,180
and he deals with this subject matter

636
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,620
and we're looking here and seeing what Paul's dealing with

637
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,500
and as he gets to verse number eight

638
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,860
and kind of circles back

639
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,020
and summarizes what he's taking place,

640
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,500
he deals with the intent, the purpose, if you will.

641
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,700
Look at what he says.

642
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

643
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,660
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

644
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,580
I believe that the apostle Paul believed in prayer.

645
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,140
As you look and read the epistles,

646
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,540
as you notice the phraseology of Paul,

647
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,340
you find that in the book of Ephesians

648
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,700
on two different occasions,

649
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,020
he speaks to the believers in Ephesus

650
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,540
about how he was praying for them.

651
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,940
Again, we would look specifically

652
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,900
within the context of those prayers

653
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
and we would see that Paul's saying,

654
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,100
not only am I praying for you,

655
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,500
but here's how I'm praying for you.

656
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,940
We find that as he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

657
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,780
in every prayer of mine for you,

658
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,940
we find that as he writes to the believers in Colossae,

659
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,540
he shares with them how that he was praying for them.

660
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,220
See, Paul understood the importance of prayer.

661
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,140
Paul didn't just preach the importance of prayer,

662
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,860
but he practiced prayer in his own life.

663
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,900
Not only did he often share

664
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,620
with those that he was writing to

665
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,540
how he was praying for them,

666
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,660
but you can find on many occasion

667
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,660
that Paul would then request of those

668
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,940
that he was writing to that they would pray for him.

669
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,340
We speak often about that truth in 1 Thessalonians 5,

670
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,260
where he says very simply this,

671
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,380
brethren, pray for us.

672
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,980
This request of the Apostle Paul

673
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,340
that the believers would be engaged

674
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,180
in the ministry of prayer,

675
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:39,020
we find that it's there in Ephesians chapter number six

676
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,620
as we speak about the importance of prayer

677
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,020
after he goes through the fact

678
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,140
that we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

679
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,700
that we're to put on the whole armor of God,

680
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,380
and he goes through each of those pieces of the armor

681
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,580
and he says this in verse 18 of Ephesians 6,

682
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,580
praying always with all prayer and supplication

683
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,780
in the Spirit,

684
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,540
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

685
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,780
and supplication for all saints.

686
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,420
And then he says this,

687
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,460
and for me, what's he doing?

688
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,900
He's saying specifically,

689
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,940
here's how I want you to pray for me.

690
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,700
And for me that utterance may be given unto me

691
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,940
that I may open my mouth boldly

692
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,180
to make known the mystery of the gospel

693
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,900
for which I am an ambassador in bonds

694
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,980
that therein I may speak boldly

695
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,780
as I ought to speak.

696
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,300
He says to the believers in Thessalonica,

697
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,460
I mentioned already in 1 Thessalonians 5 in verse 25,

698
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,860
brethren, pray for us.

699
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,100
In 2 Thessalonians 3 in verse number one,

700
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,420
he says, finally, brethren,

701
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,780
pray for us that the word of the Lord

702
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,940
may have free course and be glorified

703
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,300
even as it is with you.

704
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,140
See, Paul didn't just teach on the subject matter of prayer,

705
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,100
Paul practiced the discipline of prayer,

706
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,420
if I could use that terminology again.

707
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,780
We know that prayer is so much more

708
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,540
than just a religious activity.

709
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,740
It's communing with the God of the universe,

710
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,500
our Savior, our Creator,

711
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,140
that we're entering into His presence,

712
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,700
but we understand that Paul would teach

713
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,260
on the subject matter of prayer,

714
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,500
but he himself was engaged in the ministry of prayer.

715
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,740
He himself would share with those that he wrote to

716
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,700
how he was praying for them.

717
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,700
We find that he then would request of those same people,

718
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,580
would you pray for me?

719
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,780
And he would share specific requests.

720
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,980
You know, when somebody shares a specific request,

721
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,100
it enables us to pray in a specific manner.

722
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,780
That we would understand that as we're engaged

723
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,620
in this level of prayer,

724
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,460
it's not just this generalization of Lord bless them

725
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,500
and Lord bless them and Lord help them.

726
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,220
No, we're able to get into this ministry

727
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,660
of intercessory prayer where we understand

728
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,900
the needs of one another,

729
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,060
we understand the situations that we're dealing with

730
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,700
and we can then engage in that specific prayer.

731
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,660
We find in many cases that the Apostle Paul,

732
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,580
as he would pray for the believers that he's writing to,

733
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,260
that he would mention to them

734
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,700
how he was praying for them that they would grow,

735
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,100
that they would increase in their knowledge,

736
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,420
that they would be strengthened in their inner man.

737
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,020
He was praying for them from a spiritual perspective.

738
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,620
So often I believe that we fall short

739
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,140
in dealing with things from a perspective of prayer

740
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,140
where we deal too often with the temporal plane

741
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,220
and not enough with the eternal plane.

742
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,780
We deal with things that are very temporally focused

743
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,660
in our time of prayer and we deal with these ailments

744
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,260
and other things that we might deal with,

745
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,740
but how important it is

746
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,420
that we would understand the eternal plane,

747
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,100
that we'd understand the importance of praying

748
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,980
for our brothers and sisters in Christ,

749
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,220
that they would grow in their walk with Christ,

750
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,180
that their faith would be increased,

751
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
that they would have,

752
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,620
I mean, when you pray one for another,

753
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,180
you can pray that God would give them

754
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,460
sweet times of communion in his word and that they would grow

755
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,100
and I mean, we're going through those things

756
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,580
and we're encouraging one another and what a blessing.

757
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,220
And Paul says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere.

758
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,660
Notice, lifting up holy hands,

759
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,900
but then I want you to notice what he says without.

760
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,620
Without wrath and doubting.

761
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,380
Without wrath and doubting.

762
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,940
There's no place where wrath and doubting would be present

763
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,540
and we'd be able to pray in the manner

764
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,900
in which we're supposed to.

765
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,220
Prayer is not only asking God, but it's believing God.

766
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
It's believing that he's able.

767
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,920
See, the prayer of faith is what we speak of

768
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,400
in James chapter number five

769
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,760
and we understand that we're praying to the God

770
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,799
who is able to do exceeding abundantly above

771
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:09,920
all that we ask or think.

772
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,320
Dean shared with me a story a couple of years ago.

773
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,359
I don't remember, I think it was a couple of years ago

774
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,760
and Dean shares a lot of stories with me

775
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,119
and some I remember and some I do not,

776
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,960
but on one particular occasion, Dean,

777
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,000
you'll know all the details.

778
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,760
I don't need you to fill it in right now.

779
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,679
If somebody is interested,

780
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,080
they could come and speak to you,

781
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,739
but I believe it was in California

782
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:31,840
where there was someone that needed a mountain moved.

783
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Do you remember sharing this story with me?

784
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,500
And they had this, and it was gonna cost a lot of money

785
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,299
to get all of this soil, this dirt, this mountain,

786
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,920
if you will, to have it removed,

787
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,840
to bring in the workers that would be necessary

788
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,480
and the front loaders and the dump trucks

789
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,559
and all of those things that would be necessary

790
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,280
just cost a lot of money.

791
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,859
And they said, you know, we should pray about this

792
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,299
and not too long after they were praying about it,

793
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:58,340
the county decided that there was some kind

794
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,900
of development project that had to happen

795
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
and they needed to.

796
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,420
move all of that stuff. And they just came in and moved it all. That's pretty

797
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,460
neat story. And it's not just something somebody made up, it's a real account of

798
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,900
something that happened in a local area with a church that was there. And the

799
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,060
reality is that we, as we go to God in prayer, we ought not to enter in with a

800
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:27,780
spirit of doubting. We enter in with a spirit of faith, believing that God is

801
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,700
able, believing that He changes the hearts of men. When we read the Word of

802
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,420
God and we see throughout the history of mankind, and we see throughout the

803
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,700
examples that He's given us and recorded for us in the Word of God, and we

804
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,900
see how God worked in miraculous ways. What does it do? It increases our faith.

805
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,920
That we go to God in prayer, believing that He's able. You don't understand the

806
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,560
situation. The problem, and I say this with all humility, is that the person

807
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,920
that says that doesn't understand God. It's really the situation. Because it

808
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,520
doesn't matter how big the situation might be, our God is greater. It doesn't

809
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,600
matter how big the problem might seem to be from our perspective. And see, that's

810
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,640
one of the difficulties as we look at our problems as being little or big

811
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,840
based upon our perspective. But all of our problems are little compared to God.

812
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,080
Amen? Because He's able. We find this truth. Notice in 1 John 5. Turn

813
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,280
there if you will. We'll conclude with this passage of Scripture. In 1 John

814
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:50,880
5, I want you to notice in verses 14 and 15. What great promise that we

815
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:02,080
have here. Remember, as a believer, as a child of God, prayer is our distinct

816
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:11,960
privilege. And here's what 1 John 5, verse number 14. Notice what John says.

817
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,840
And this is the confidence that we have in Him. Now I want you to just circle that

818
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,640
word confidence or underline it or something. Take note of it. Because it's

819
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,320
important for us to have confidence. This assurance. Being assured of this thing

820
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,200
that is being spoken of. And John says this is the confidence that we have in

821
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:43,400
Him. That if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. Now you might

822
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,000
want to underline that according to His will. Amen? By the way, how do we know

823
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,160
what His will is? Well, we better get into the Word of God. Because when we get

824
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:00,320
into the Word of God, we understand that God reveals to us His will. We find here

825
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,680
that even as we mentioned in 1 Timothy chapter number 2, that He spoke

826
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,120
about that general will of God for men to be saved. You know that when you're

827
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,960
praying for the salvation of an individual, that you are praying

828
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,840
according to the will of God. When we have in our prayer list a list of people

829
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,160
that we're praying for that are lost, that need to come to Christ in faith,

830
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,600
that we are praying according to the will of God. And we see here it says that

831
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,360
if we ask anything, this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if

832
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:40,680
we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He

833
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,200
heareth us, now look at that word know. See, throughout the Scriptures we find this

834
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,160
very important thing. God wants His people to be informed. He doesn't want us

835
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,320
to be ignorant. Paul actually uses the terminology many times, I would not have

836
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,400
you to be ignorant brethren. We see that the understanding and the truth is that

837
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,280
we are to be informed people. We are to know some things. In fact, in the book of

838
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,720
1 John, there are several things that he deals with, one of which is found in the

839
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,960
precious truth of verse number 13, which just precedes this particular subject

840
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,080
that we're dealing with on prayer. But he says, these things have I written unto

841
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,840
you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have

842
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,720
eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. See, God wants us

843
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,520
to know that we're His children. He wants us to have that assurance. He wants us to

844
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,360
know it. There are some that would say, oh that's awful prideful for you to say

845
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,080
that you know that you're going to heaven when you die. No, there's

846
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,080
absolutely no pride involved because it's not of my own merit. It's all

847
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,880
because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, and He wants me to know.

848
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,760
He wants us to know some things, it says, and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever

849
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,600
we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. What a

850
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:09,360
joy to understand the promise here in verses 14 and 15 with regard to the

851
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,760
subject matter of prayer. We can trust that God is at work. Can I tell you this

852
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,560
evening, you may not see how God is working. You may not fully understand

853
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,680
what God is doing on the other end. You may not know how God is working in and

854
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,760
through that circumstance. It may take years of laboring in prayer, but we can

855
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,800
rest assured that if we're praying according to His will, that we have this

856
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,400
confidence that He hears us and that He is able. And we find that yes, there are

857
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,320
times in which the answer from God, as we've spoken of this morning briefly

858
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,240
from 2nd Corinthians chapter number 12, when Paul is told, my grace is

859
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,240
sufficient for thee. No Paul, I'm not gonna remove that thorn that you have in

860
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,280
your flesh, though you've asked, you've besought thrice for that thing, that it

861
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,420
might depart from you. No, because my grace is sufficient for thee. And he

862
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,800
says that my strength is made perfect in weakness. When that answer comes, we just

863
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,280
continue to walk forward and understand what Paul says. He says, most gladly

864
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,760
therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may

865
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,480
rest upon me. Verse number 10 of that passage of Scripture says, therefore I

866
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,600
take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in

867
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:40,280
persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.

868
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,440
This evening, prayer as our first response. I believe that this evening, not

869
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,600
only for those that are gathered here locally, but even for those that are

870
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,920
tuned in via live stream, I believe that most all of us, I dare say every single

871
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,920
one of us, would say we believe in the importance of prayer. We believe that

872
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,400
prayer is a privilege of the child of God. But if we'd be honest this evening,

873
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:20,720
many times in our lives, prayer is not our first response. Far too often we lean

874
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,960
on our own understanding. I'm guilty of prayer not always being my first

875
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,960
response. Let's try to figure this out. Let's try to have a meeting, call

876
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:39,320
somebody, discuss something, figure this out. When our first response should be to

877
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,840
drop on our knees and to seek the face of God, knowing that He is able, knowing

878
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,960
that He has told us that it pleases Him. Oh, that we would be engaged, as we

879
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,240
noticed in the text of Scripture, in the ministry of intercessory prayer one for

880
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,080
another. But even as I mentioned to you, it's easier for me to pray for you than

881
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:06,240
it is for me to pray for those in the elected officials. But we have a biblical

882
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,120
mandate, a responsibility to pray for them. And I want to encourage you to

883
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:16,000
understand that this is acceptable in the sight of God. It's pleasing. It's good

884
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,320
and acceptable in the sight of God. And this evening, we find this exhortation

885
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,160
that Paul gives to Timothy here in 1 Timothy 2, prayer as a first response. Oh,

886
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:35,640
that we would be people of prayer. J. Sidlow Baxter said this with regard to

887
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,840
prayer. He said, men may spurn my appeal, reject our message, despise our persons,

888
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:50,040
but they are helpless against our prayers. Sometimes we say something like

889
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:57,040
this, I'll pray for you. And can I tell you, at times it almost seems as the one

890
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,240
saying those words, that it's almost inadequate for the situation. Because

891
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:11,040
we've been cultured to think that there's something I should do. But the

892
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,640
greatest thing that we could do for someone is to pray for them. To pray for

893
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,520
them. And when someone says to you, I'm praying for you, or I will pray for you,

894
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,119
I hope that that brings great comfort to your heart. And that you understand that

895
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,360
that is an eternal investment that's being made on my behalf. That someone

896
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,600
would engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer. Paul said, brethren,

897
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,480
pray for us. Prayer as a first response. Father, we love you. We thank you for

898
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,000
loving us. God, I pray that you would help me. I mentioned at the beginning of this

899
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:57,559
message tonight that I was preaching to myself. And that I was seeking to help

900
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:01,880
those who were here and those that were listening. God, that's my desire.

901
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,320
That's my prayer.

902
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,080
I pray that, Lord, You'd help us

903
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,360
in this area of prayer.

904
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,140
That prayer would be our first response.

905
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:20,860
So often, I've been guilty.

906
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,380
I dare say many of us have been guilty

907
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,820
of understanding the great privilege of prayer,

908
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,300
of understanding the power of prayer,

909
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,220
and understanding that You delight in answering prayer,

910
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,100
but quite simply failing to pray.

911
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,040
Lord, help us.

912
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,660
We say with the disciples in Luke,

913
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,980
Lord, teach us to pray.

914
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,940
We pray that You'd have Your will and way in our lives tonight.

915
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,020
Help us, Lord, to do business with You.

916
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,780
To allow You, even as we sang that last hymn this evening,

917
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,780
to allow You to have Your way with us.

918
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,940
That we'd be honest and transparent before You.

919
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,620
We'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.
