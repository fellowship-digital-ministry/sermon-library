00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.099
So we're gonna look at the first eight verses

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:06.159
of this chapter, be the context for our study this evening.

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:07.800
Of course, you know in the book of 1 Timothy

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.159
that the Apostle Paul is writing to Timothy,

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.420
his son in the faith.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.000
Timothy would be a pastor.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.159
He was going to, of course, serve in the ministry.

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.319
Timothy often was sent from place to place.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.200
The Apostle Paul mentioned to the church at Philippi

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.479
that he was gonna send Timotheus unto them.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.659
We find that Paul mentioned, of course,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.139
to the church at Thessalonica

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:32.020
that when he couldn't go to visit them

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.540
to find out their estate, who did he send?

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.860
He sent Timotheus.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.540
And so Timothy was his son in the faith.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.619
Timothy served the Lord faithfully.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.580
And these two epistles, 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.099
we find that Paul is writing to Timothy,

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:47.939
seeking to encourage him,

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:50.500
and of course, to give him instruction.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.340
And in 1 Timothy, chapter number two,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.860
we find that the Bible says,

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.380
I exhort therefore that first of all,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.020
supplications, prayers, intercessions,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.819
and giving of thanks be made for all men,

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.660
for kings and for all that are in authority,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.419
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:11.860
in all godliness and honesty.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.379
For this is good and acceptable

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.300
in the sight of God our Savior,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.940
who will have all men to be saved

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.220
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.019
For there's one God and one mediator

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:24.419
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.900
who gave Himself a ransom for all

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660
to be testified in due time,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.059
whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.459
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not,

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.019
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:45.300
Verse 8, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.099
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.540
It's interesting as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.900
and see the place of prayer,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.980
the title for the message this evening

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.019
is Prayer as Our First Response.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.059
Prayer as Our First Response.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.819
We understand as Bible-believing Christians,

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.980
we understand the place of prayer in our lives.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.460
We understand the privilege of prayer.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.539
We often speak about what a wonderful privilege it is

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.139
that we can go to God in prayer,

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.339
we can go to God at any time for any reason.

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.619
We often quote, many of us have memorized

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.740
a certain number of prayer promises from the Word of God.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.460
Call unto me and I will answer thee

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860
and show thee great and mighty things

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.179
which thou knowest not, Jeremiah 33 in verse number three.

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:36.100
And we memorize and rehearse Ephesians 3.20,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.380
now unto him which is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.220
above all that we ask or think.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.100
We understand James 5, the effectual fervent prayer

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.179
of a righteous man availeth much.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.619
We understand Hebrews 4 in verse number 16,

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.380
let us come boldly unto the throne of grace.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.820
And we go through these verses of Scripture,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.940
we understand the great privilege of prayer.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.339
And sometimes, unfortunately,

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.419
though we know all of those things,

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.380
at times in our lives, prayer, if we'd be honest,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.660
is not our first response.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.539
Amen?

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:15.020
I'm preaching to myself, but I'm also trying to help you.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.660
Because I know in my life, in the 20 plus years

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.220
that I've been saved and walking with the Lord,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.419
I have understood, I have been taught,

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.580
I have studied, I have preached,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.259
I have taught on the subject matter of prayer.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.580
But one of the most challenging things

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.380
in the Christian discipline,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.419
if I could use that terminology, is prayer.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.979
We find that many people,

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.220
I've spoken with many people over the years,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.539
I've spoken to people in ministry,

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.899
I've spoken to people in churches,

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.460
and I've had interaction with those

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.460
that have sought to how can I have an improved prayer life?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.220
Why is it that it seems like my prayer life

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.419
isn't what it should be?

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.699
There are people that struggle with prayer.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.419
I know that for many,

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.779
as we would enter into our time of prayer,

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.740
and I should say that it is important

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.580
that we have a time of prayer.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.699
Yes, we're to pray without ceasing.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.139
As we understand, Paul tells the believers

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.339
in Thessalonica,

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.380
and that's important that we understand that truth

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.339
to always be in that spirit of praying

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.260
and understand that we can enter into His presence.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.700
But we understand there ought to be a set time

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.059
that we enter into our prayer closet.

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.700
We understand that we don't pray as the Pharisees.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.940
Remember, Jesus said of those that they have their reward,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.260
the applause of man.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.299
But the privilege of prayer is a distinct privilege

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:43.500
for the child of God.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.140
And as a child of God,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.779
I have this privilege to go to my heavenly Father

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.500
at any time for any reason.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.859
That's amazing.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.260
The God of the universe,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.700
we speak about the Lord,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.140
we speak about the fact that He is Creator,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.260
He is Redeemer, He is our Father,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.299
He is our refuge, He is our shield, our buckler.

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:09.459
I mean, we understand His power and His wisdom,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
and we understand the availability that we have,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.820
the privilege to enter in His presence,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.619
but at times, we simply fail to seek His face.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.100
At times in our lives,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
we simply cannot say that prayer is our first response.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:28.859
In fact, there are times in our lives

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:31.420
that we've tried all sorts of things.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.100
We've read books.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.899
We've asked friends.

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.940
We've sought counsel.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.940
And after we've failed and we've found no solution,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.100
we say something like this,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.019
maybe we should pray about it.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.540
It's interesting, the disciples asked the Lord,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.700
it's recorded in Luke 11, in verse number one,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.660
they said this very simply,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.059
teach us to pray.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:57.739
Teach us to pray.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.779
We understand that there's a model prayer.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.459
Our Father, which art in heaven,

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:02.940
hallowed be Thy name.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.420
I won't recite all of it,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.739
but we understand there's a model prayer.

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:09.420
Then there's the prayer of Jesus,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.579
the prayer of Christ in John 17.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:16.100
And we understand that Jesus often

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.140
went into a remote place for the purpose of prayer.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.619
Some have questioned, why is it if Jesus is God,

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:26.899
why would He have to go and pray to God?

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:27.940
He is God.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.299
We understand that He is the 100% man.

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:33.579
He's 100% God.

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:38.579
The incarnation, the truth of that amazing miracle

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.299
that God took on human flesh.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.339
And He came to earth,

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.899
but we find that through His earthly ministry,

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:48.660
as He would often resort hither

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.500
for the purpose of prayer,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.420
that not only was He having that communion

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.380
with the Father,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.500
but we find that He was leaving an example for us.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.700
In fact, Peter would say later

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.779
that we are to follow His steps,

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.420
that Jesus left us an example

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.059
that we should follow His steps.

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:07.899
But the disciples say in Luke 11, 1,

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.980
Lord, teach us to pray.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.339
I want to read to you a definition.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.140
This is a Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.500
definition of prayer.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.019
Now, we would understand,

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:24.459
as I read this definition to you of the word prayer

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.579
in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828,

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.739
we would understand how influential the Bible was

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:34.420
on the definitions of that time.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.940
Here's the definition.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.820
It says, here's what prayer is.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820
In worship, a solemn address to the supreme being,

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:48.299
to God, consisting of adoration

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:52.660
or an expression of our sense of God's glorious perfections.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.339
Number two, confession of our sins.

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:59.299
Number three, supplication for mercy and forgiveness.

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:03.019
Number four, intercession for blessings on others.

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:05.019
And number five, thanksgiving

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.779
or an expression of gratitude to God

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.420
for His mercies and benefits.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.059
That's a great definition.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.459
I believe that prayer is the most obvious expression

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:21.019
of our dependence upon God.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.980
In fact, when I fail to pray,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.859
in essence, I'm saying I can handle it myself.

00:08:27.859 --> 00:08:29.779
I'm sufficient at this.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.820
Whatever the task might be.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.820
But we find that as Paul is writing to Timothy

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.460
and he's giving him this exhortation,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.580
he tells him in verse number one,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.780
I exhort, therefore, notice the priority of prayer.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.940
He says, I exhort, therefore, that first of all,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.179
we're gonna notice as we go through the text of Scripture,

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.260
I don't really have a bunch of points this evening,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.659
we're just gonna walk through the passage of Scripture,

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.260
but I want you to notice the priority

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.340
that is placed upon prayer.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.419
The Apostle Paul is giving this exhortation

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:03.380
and he says to Timothy, he says,

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.659
this exhortation that I'm bringing to you,

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:08.979
he says, I exhort, therefore, that first of all,

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:11.780
he's placing this priority,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.299
the place of prayer in the life of,

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:18.299
yes, Timothy, as a church leader,

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:20.460
but we could understand the application

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.140
for every child of God and the importance of,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.419
even as we've used for our title this evening,

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:29.380
prayer as our first response.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.299
I referenced James 5,

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:34.020
the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.700
Prior to that verse of Scripture,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.859
we find the Bible says if any are sick, let them pray.

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:43.179
Again, the first response.

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:46.539
We find that the description of prayer is given.

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:49.700
It's interesting how verse number one of 1 Timothy 2

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.859
lines up so closely with the definition of Noah Webster

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.940
in his 1828 edition of the dictionary.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.140
Again, no doubt of the influence of.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.940
Scripture upon that definition. Notice the description that is given. I exhort

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:09.940
therefore that first of all, he breaks it into four categories. Supplications,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:15.740
specifically making a request for a need. There are times as God's people that we

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.500
need things. If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God which giveth to all men

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.660
liberally and upbraideth not. I recognize in my life on a regular basis, and I hope

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.980
that you recognize in your life on a regular basis, that I need wisdom. There

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.420
are times we need direction for our life. I'm so thankful that God is able to

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.260
provide the direction that we need for our life. He's able to give us wisdom.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.980
There are times that we need certain things. Remember, our God knows what we

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:51.220
have need of. By the way, sometimes what we consider a need is really just a want.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.660
But we find that here, supplications, it's making requests for need, prayers,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:04.180
the idea of this broadly used term there would simply give us the understanding

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.180
of direct communication with God. Aren't you thankful that you can go direct to

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.700
God? The God of the universe. The God who said, let there be light, and there was

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:21.940
light. The God who parted the Red Sea, parted the Jordan that sent fire from

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.780
heaven. I mean, we could go through all of the miracles, and we could understand in

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.100
the gospel records the wonderful miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:38.140
could understand that we can go directly to God in prayer. Intercessions. The

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:43.860
ministry of intercessory prayer is such an important ministry. It's praying for

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.220
or on behalf of another. You know it's a blessing to know that someone's praying

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:56.300
for you? It really is. It's a blessing when somebody says to you, I'm praying

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.820
for you. I like to add to that when somebody says I'm praying for you, and

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.980
here's how I'm praying for you. That's even an extra benefit of blessing

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.740
because we know what they're praying for us specifically in a specific way. By the

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.340
way, as Christian people, as brothers and sisters in Christ, we have the unique

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:23.260
opportunity to go into the ministry of intercessory prayer and pray on the

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.340
behalf of one another. What a joy. You know it's exciting when you know that

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:36.260
scores of people are praying for you? What comfort that brings. Speaking to a

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.460
pastor friend not many months ago, and as I was speaking with him, there was a

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.420
family situation they were dealing with and we were praying for them and I

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.460
wanted to let him know I didn't send him a text every single day and multiple

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.980
times throughout the day, but occasionally as the Lord would lay it

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.860
upon my heart, I would reach out let him know that we were praying for him and I

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.340
would let him know specifically how we were praying. And on one particular

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:07.460
occasion he replied back and he let me know just the the wonderful report and

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.420
testimony of what was happening and he said that we are convinced that this is

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.660
the direct result of so many people that are praying for us. He said I'm getting

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.220
text messages and emails and phone calls from pastor friends, from church members,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.380
from missionaries and evangelists all over the world that they're praying for

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:35.180
us. That's encouraging. What a blessing. He says not only supplications, prayers,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.460
intercessions, notice giving of thanks. Our God is worthy in everything give

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.620
thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Sometimes

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.540
we might find it difficult in certain circumstances to give thanks, but we must

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.660
understand that our God has a purpose. We must understand that his purpose is far

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.140
greater than our convenience. See at times we might have a difficulty giving

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.020
thanks for a circumstance because quite honestly I don't like the circumstance.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.660
But it might be in that circumstance that God is going to be glorified in a

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:19.620
way that he could not otherwise be glorified. I think of Paul. He wrote to

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.580
the church at Philippi from prison. One of the most joyful books that you can

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.540
read in all of the Bible and he's writing from prison. I think of Paul and

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.620
Silas when they are at Philippi. Remember what was happening? They were beaten,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.260
accused, and they were imprisoned. But what were they doing at midnight? They were

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:46.740
singing and praising God. No wonder when that jail cell broke open because of the

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.060
earthquake that that jailer after the initial conversation with Paul said,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:59.700
sirs, what must I do to be saved? See we find that there's a priority on prayer.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.940
He says, first of all, there's the description that is given, supplications,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.740
prayers, intercessions, giving of thanks, notice for whom we are to pray. He says

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.820
at the end of verse number one, giving of thanks be made for all men. He continues

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.700
into verse number two, for kings and for all that are in authority, for whom we

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.300
are to pray. It's interesting that he specifically notes the kings and for all

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:31.420
that are in authority. We don't have a king in our nation. We understand at the

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.500
time of this writing that the Emperor Nero was ruling and reigning. What a

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.460
wicked man. You read history, you understand some things of Nero and the

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.020
persecution and all that was going on. And we find here that the Apostle Paul

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:53.100
is saying to Timothy about this priority of prayer, about the description,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.100
and he says here's who you need to pray for. Notice you're to pray for kings and

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.980
for all that are in authority. I'll be honest with you, very transparent with

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.420
you, it's a lot easier for me to pray for you than it is to pray for those in

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:16.420
authority. It really is. But we have a biblical responsibility to pray for

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.700
those who are in authority. That we would understand that it is not given to us,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.180
and again as we understand contextually, historically, at the time of the writing

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.500
that Nero was the one in power, it does not matter whether I agree with the

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.220
individual that's in the office. It's a biblical mandate that we pray for them.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:41.500
And it's interesting as we find this truth of whom we are to pray for. Yes, we

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.180
understand that we're to pray for our brethren and be engaged in that ministry

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.820
of intercessory prayer, and what a blessing that is. But to think that we're

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:54.180
to pray for kings and for all that are in authority, and we notice the impact, it

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.540
says this at the end of verse number two, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:05.700
life in all godliness and honesty. The impact of following the admonition that

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.340
is given, we find that this impact is something that we would desire. The

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:17.220
result of obedience to this instruction that is given is a desired result. It's

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.980
certainly we would want to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:28.780
honesty. I wonder this evening if some of our elected officials were to enter

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.500
into our presence, if we could look at them and honestly before God and before

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:42.540
man say, I've prayed for you. A biblical responsibility. We find here that the

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.500
Bible tells us as we continue the thought of the impact, it says in verse

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.540
number three, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.260
Savior. You know, anytime we find in the Word of God something that God tells us

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.740
is good and acceptable to Him, we ought to take note. In like fashion, if we find

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.020
something that the Bible specifically says that did not please God, we ought to

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.300
take note. Because these are behaviors that we want to ensure are in our lives,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.500
and we find that it was in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10 that as

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.780
Paul is given truth to the believers in Corinth and he's using Old Testament

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.660
example, and he goes through a whole list of examples and he says with many of

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.740
them God was not well pleased. And then he begins to give the examples. Okay, take

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.300
note. Take a pen out and begin to understand, okay, this is behavior that

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:37.739
does not please God. But we find specifically here that the Bible says

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:42.660
that this, what Paul is dealing with contextually, the subject matter of

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.940
prayer, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. You know

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:55.100
that our God delights in answering prayer? He is a prayer answering God. He

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:01.460
said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:06.340
mighty things which thou knowest not. We understand that our God is a prayer

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:13.619
answering God. And he is pleased when we go before his presence and seek his

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:19.299
face, when we spend that time in prayer. By the way, one thing that I think is

00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:23.980
dangerous for us in 2020, living in the generation that we're living in,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:31.540
sometimes we think that praying is not as effective as doing. Because sometimes

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.780
we think if I just do, do, do, do, and I do all of these things, that that's gonna

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.859
provide more result. The reality is that we ought to spend more time in prayer. I

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:45.420
use the example of the one cutting down a tree. Now, without a chainsaw, now if you

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.540
have a chainsaw and you have a chain that's not sharpened, that can be quite

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.460
frustrating as well. But I'm thinking about cutting down a tree with an axe.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:01.940
You know, the man that would understand the role

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.980
of cutting down a tree

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.820
and using an axe to do so,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.400
would understand the importance

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.320
of taking time to sharpen his tool.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.760
Because the sharper his axe,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.100
the more effective he could be

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.700
on cutting down that tree.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.460
Truthfully, as we would understand

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.880
the passage of Scripture

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.380
and the power of prayer,

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.820
we should spend more time praying

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.060
before we go out door-knocking.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.700
Sometimes, we just pray for just a quick moment,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.140
and then we go out in our own efforts.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.020
See, the ministry of prayer.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.540
We see it in the life of the disciples

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.000
and we understand that Peter deals with this

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.220
of course, in Acts 5

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.060
and dealing with those things that are going on

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.300
there in chapter 6.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.860
And he talks about the fact

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.180
that they would give themselves continually

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.780
to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.460
But see, unfortunately, sometimes

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.020
in our society today,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.660
we do not place the proper value upon prayer.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.980
If someone were to ask me,

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.459
what did you do last Tuesday?

00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:17.700
I said, well, I spent three hours in prayer.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.620
That's all you did?

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.340
Oh, but if we spent three hours in prayer,

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.940
how effective that would be.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.220
And see, sometimes our thinking

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.500
is just not where it ought to be.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.779
Because we think that we have minimized prayer

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:34.380
and we have taken the approach

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.700
of what we can do in our efforts.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.380
Oh, how we need God.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.480
We find here, that as we think about the impact,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.700
that it's good and acceptable

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.400
in the sight of God our Savior.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.060
Notice, in verses four through seven,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.020
really there's a parenthetical thought,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.500
but there's great Bible truth that is given to us.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.980
And let's go through it and see what Paul is saying.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.620
Notice he says this,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.180
in this parenthetical thought,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.020
he begins with revealing really a general will of God.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.300
It says, who, speaking of God still,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.180
will have all men to be saved

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.860
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.699
Isn't that wonderful?

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:14.860
Two-fold purpose, if you consider the general will of God

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.900
as it's revealed here in verse number four.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.940
Number one, that mankind would be saved.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.339
The Bible teaches us that God is not willing

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:23.460
that any should perish,

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.699
but that all should come to repentance.

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:26.820
And we find here that it says,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.699
who will have all men to be saved,

00:22:29.699 --> 00:22:31.139
not only to be saved,

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:35.619
but we find to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:38.699
We'd understand as we would look at the Great Commission

00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:40.380
and we would understand the truth

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.100
of the entirety of the Great Commission,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.500
not only of preaching the gospel

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.100
and baptizing the believers,

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.860
but then teaching them all things whatsoever.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.300
I have commanded thee in the ministry of discipleship

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.400
and that training and that instruction.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.119
And we find that Paul here reveals

00:22:58.119 --> 00:22:59.720
this general will of God,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.080
that all men would be saved

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.919
and come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:06.839
This is revealed and made evidence through verse number six

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:07.880
where the Bible says,

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.880
who gave himself a ransom for all

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.440
to be testified in due time.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.800
Speaking, of course, in verse number six of Jesus

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.360
as we look at in verse number five,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.800
but we think about the ransom that was given,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.080
the fact that Jesus Christ went to the cross of Calvary.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.320
He shed His precious blood for your sin

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.760
and for my sin and the sin of the world.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.320
And we'd find that as we look at these verses of Scripture

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.400
and we'd understand in verse four and six

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.520
as this parenthetical thought deals

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.839
with the general will of God for mankind to be saved,

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:44.559
for God so loved the world

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:46.000
that He gave His only begotten Son

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.940
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.080
but have everlasting life.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.559
Notice, not only does Paul give us

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.520
this general will of God,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.520
but we find that in verse number five

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.040
that he shares with us the truth

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.600
that the Lord Jesus Christ is our mediator.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.839
By the way, there is no other person

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:08.839
that can fill the role of mediator.

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:11.779
There's no priest, there's no anybody

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:12.880
that can fill this role

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.639
for we find this truth in verse number five,

00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:18.679
for there is one God and one mediator

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:23.679
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:26.640
Now as we look at this truth in verse number five,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.440
we understand there is one God.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.959
We've often made the statement

00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:33.239
and we understand the biblical truth

00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:35.179
that Jesus Christ is God,

00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:37.320
that He came and He manifested the Father

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.420
unto the people.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.080
We look at His life and ministry

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.959
and the gospel records,

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:47.279
but we find that this ministry of Him being our mediator

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.760
was accomplished how?

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.160
It was made possible through His substitutionary atonement

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.119
and His glorious resurrection.

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:56.279
We understand that as we read the book of Hebrews

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:58.080
in chapter number nine,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.200
if you take a moment to just turn over

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.760
to the book of Hebrews and look in the ninth chapter,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.179
we'll also mention a verse over in the 12th chapter,

00:25:05.179 --> 00:25:08.320
but we find here right in the midst

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.000
of this text of Scripture in Hebrews 9 and 10

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.959
dealing with the substitutionary work

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:17.640
of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.920
And of course, throughout the book of Hebrews,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.559
some of which we've already studied

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:23.799
on our Sunday morning messages

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.760
through the first six chapters now,

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.360
we have found the work that was accomplished

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.399
and the benefits of Christ's work at the cross of Calvary,

00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:34.279
what was accomplished through that.

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:38.760
We notice here specifically in verse 15 and 16 of Hebrews 9,

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.640
it says, and for this cause,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.480
He is the mediator of the New Testament.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.399
Let's back up and get it in context.

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:47.720
Look in verse number 11,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.839
but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come

00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:55.519
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:58.760
not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.799
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.559
but by His own blood,

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:05.720
He entered in once into the holy place,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.880
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.600
Isn't that wonderful?

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.119
Verse 13, for if the blood of bulls and of goats

00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:15.519
and the ashes of an heifer,

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:17.440
sprinkling the unclean sanctified

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.600
through the purifying of the flesh,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.559
how much more shall the blood of Christ

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.519
who through the eternal spirit

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:26.920
offered himself without spot to God,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.519
purge your conscience from dead works

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:31.920
to serve the living God.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.320
And for this cause,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.839
He is the mediator of the New Testament

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:38.160
that by means of death,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.320
for the redemption of the transgressions

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.279
that were under the first Testament,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.920
they which are called might receive

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.679
the promise of eternal inheritance

00:26:46.679 --> 00:26:48.399
for where a Testament is,

00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:53.399
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:56.959
We find that in chapter number 12 in verse number 24,

00:26:56.959 --> 00:27:00.160
the Bible says this with regard to the subject matter

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.080
of the Lord Jesus Christ being the mediator.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.679
The Bible says unto Jesus,

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:06.959
the mediator of the new covenant

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.440
and to the blood of sprinkling

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.080
that speaketh better things than that of Abel.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.000
I'm thankful that I can go to God

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.119
at any time through the Lord Jesus Christ

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.559
that He is the mediator.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.040
There's one God and one mediator

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.160
between man and God,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.760
the man, Christ Jesus,

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.080
between God and man, excuse me,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.440
the man, Christ Jesus.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.399
We find that Paul as he continues this thought

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:36.080
of sharing things in this parenthetical thought,

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.959
he then deals with his own call upon his own life

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:41.160
in verse number seven.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.160
He says where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:49.320
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.559
A teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:55.559
You find that the apostle Paul is referencing once again

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.679
as he does often throughout the epistles that he writes

00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:01.959
the call that God placed upon his life.

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:04.600
Remember when the apostle Paul was Saul

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.040
and he was on the road to Damascus

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880
and this is recorded in Acts nine.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.000
He says, who art thou Lord?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
And then he says, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:19.519
And we find that in that passage of scripture

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:23.399
a little while later in Acts chapter nine

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:26.559
that he is given instruction.

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:30.440
It was the responsibility of Ananias to come.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.080
And he says, brother Saul in verse number 17,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.239
the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way

00:28:36.239 --> 00:28:37.840
as thou comest hath sent me

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.599
that thou mightest receive thy sight

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:43.119
and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:46.080
Look at what the Lord says to Ananias

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.840
with regard to this one Saul,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.799
because Ananias of course had some concerns

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.119
about going to Saul.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:53.559
He had heard about the authority that he had

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.679
and about his testimony.

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:58.320
And he says, go thy way in verse 15 and 16

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.919
for he is a chosen vessel unto me

00:29:00.919 --> 00:29:03.599
to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:04.919
and the children of Israel

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:08.280
for I will show him how great things he must suffer

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.200
for my namesake.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.440
It's an amazing truth in verse number 20

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.559
that he preached Christ in the synagogue

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:17.960
that he is the Son of God.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.000
The same one that in the beginning of the passage of Acts nine

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.200
he is going with the authority with letters

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.599
to go to the synagogues

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:28.400
that if he found any of that way,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.159
those that were followers of Christ,

00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:32.720
that whether they were men or women

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.559
that he could bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.960
Paul shares it this way in the book of Galatians

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.840
as he's speaking to those

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.799
and speaking about his testimony.

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:43.720
He says this in verse number 15

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.760
understanding his own call to the ministry.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.720
I'll actually back up to verse number 11.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.960
Paul says this in Galatians one in verse 11,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.599
but I certify you brethren

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:55.679
that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.280
For I neither received it of man

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.359
neither was I taught it

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:01.640
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.220
For you have heard of my conversation in time past

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.480
in the Jews' religion,

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.900
how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.640
and wasted it,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.180
and profited in the Jews' religion

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.180
above many my equals in mine own nation,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.100
being more exceedingly zealous

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.560
of the traditions of my fathers.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.060
But when it pleased God,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.720
who separated me from my mother's womb

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.440
and called me by His grace

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.680
to reveal His Son in me,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.220
that I might preach Him among the heathen,

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.640
immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood."

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.840
Notice it's interesting,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.380
we could read the entirety of the text,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.260
but skip down to verse number 23.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.100
It says this,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.720
but they had heard only

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.380
that He which persecuted us in times past

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:49.380
now preacheth the faith which once He destroyed.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.940
See, Paul understood his calling

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.460
and he says here to Timothy

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.020
as he's giving this truth of this parenthetical thought

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.480
that is given to us in verses four through seven,

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.320
he says,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.320
whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.700
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.340
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.020
He often would refer to himself

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.420
as being the apostle to the Gentiles,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.380
to the uncircumcision,

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.140
whereas Peter would be the apostle,

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.600
if you will, to the circumcision.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.260
He makes that note in Galatians 2

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.220
in verse seven and eight,

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.220
but contrary wise,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.340
when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.580
was committed unto me

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.140
as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.260
And we understand that Peter initially

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.860
was the one that went to the household of Cornelius.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.820
We could read that in Acts chapter number 10 and 11.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.860
And what a blessing that Peter obeyed the Lord

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.260
and he took the gospel

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.820
and as he comes to the household of Cornelius,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.740
they're sitting and waiting to receive the message

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.100
and they're saved and God works in an amazing way.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.220
But then Peter's main emphasis and main ministry,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.660
if you will, would be to the Jews,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.500
whereas Paul would have his ministry to the Gentiles.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.940
That terminology used of circumcision and uncircumcision

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.300
referring to those two groups of people.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.020
He says in faith and verity,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.260
that word often we use and speak of it as being truth

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.700
and thinking about the truth of the Word of God

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.540
and the preaching of the gospel.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.340
As we get to verse number eight,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.540
we find that Paul will now return to the original thought

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.020
of verses one through three

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.460
here in 1 Timothy chapter number two.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.020
Remember, he's speaking about the importance of prayer.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.060
He's dealing with prayer as our first response.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:47.060
He says, first of all, I exhort therefore that first of all

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.180
and he deals with this subject matter

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.620
and we're looking here and seeing what Paul's dealing with

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.500
and as he gets to verse number eight

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.860
and kind of circles back

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.020
and summarizes what he's taking place,

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.500
he deals with the intent, the purpose, if you will.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.700
Look at what he says.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.700
I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.660
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.580
I believe that the apostle Paul believed in prayer.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.140
As you look and read the epistles,

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.540
as you notice the phraseology of Paul,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.340
you find that in the book of Ephesians

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.700
on two different occasions,

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.020
he speaks to the believers in Ephesus

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.540
about how he was praying for them.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.940
Again, we would look specifically

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.900
within the context of those prayers

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.900
and we would see that Paul's saying,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.100
not only am I praying for you,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.500
but here's how I'm praying for you.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.940
We find that as he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.780
in every prayer of mine for you,

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.940
we find that as he writes to the believers in Colossae,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.540
he shares with them how that he was praying for them.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.220
See, Paul understood the importance of prayer.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.140
Paul didn't just preach the importance of prayer,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.860
but he practiced prayer in his own life.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.900
Not only did he often share

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.620
with those that he was writing to

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.540
how he was praying for them,

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.660
but you can find on many occasion

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.660
that Paul would then request of those

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.940
that he was writing to that they would pray for him.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.340
We speak often about that truth in 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.260
where he says very simply this,

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.380
brethren, pray for us.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.980
This request of the Apostle Paul

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.340
that the believers would be engaged

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.180
in the ministry of prayer,

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.020
we find that it's there in Ephesians chapter number six

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.620
as we speak about the importance of prayer

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.020
after he goes through the fact

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.140
that we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.700
that we're to put on the whole armor of God,

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.380
and he goes through each of those pieces of the armor

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.580
and he says this in verse 18 of Ephesians 6,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.580
praying always with all prayer and supplication

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.780
in the Spirit,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.540
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.780
and supplication for all saints.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.420
And then he says this,

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.460
and for me, what's he doing?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.900
He's saying specifically,

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.940
here's how I want you to pray for me.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.700
And for me that utterance may be given unto me

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.940
that I may open my mouth boldly

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.180
to make known the mystery of the gospel

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.900
for which I am an ambassador in bonds

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.980
that therein I may speak boldly

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.780
as I ought to speak.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.300
He says to the believers in Thessalonica,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.460
I mentioned already in 1 Thessalonians 5 in verse 25,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.860
brethren, pray for us.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.100
In 2 Thessalonians 3 in verse number one,

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.420
he says, finally, brethren,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.780
pray for us that the word of the Lord

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.940
may have free course and be glorified

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.300
even as it is with you.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.140
See, Paul didn't just teach on the subject matter of prayer,

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.100
Paul practiced the discipline of prayer,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.420
if I could use that terminology again.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.780
We know that prayer is so much more

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.540
than just a religious activity.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.740
It's communing with the God of the universe,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.500
our Savior, our Creator,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.140
that we're entering into His presence,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.700
but we understand that Paul would teach

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.260
on the subject matter of prayer,

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.500
but he himself was engaged in the ministry of prayer.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.740
He himself would share with those that he wrote to

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.700
how he was praying for them.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.700
We find that he then would request of those same people,

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.580
would you pray for me?

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.780
And he would share specific requests.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.980
You know, when somebody shares a specific request,

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.100
it enables us to pray in a specific manner.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.780
That we would understand that as we're engaged

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.620
in this level of prayer,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.460
it's not just this generalization of Lord bless them

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.500
and Lord bless them and Lord help them.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.220
No, we're able to get into this ministry

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.660
of intercessory prayer where we understand

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.900
the needs of one another,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.060
we understand the situations that we're dealing with

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.700
and we can then engage in that specific prayer.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.660
We find in many cases that the Apostle Paul,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.580
as he would pray for the believers that he's writing to,

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.260
that he would mention to them

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.700
how he was praying for them that they would grow,

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.100
that they would increase in their knowledge,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.420
that they would be strengthened in their inner man.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.020
He was praying for them from a spiritual perspective.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.620
So often I believe that we fall short

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.140
in dealing with things from a perspective of prayer

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.140
where we deal too often with the temporal plane

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.220
and not enough with the eternal plane.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.780
We deal with things that are very temporally focused

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.660
in our time of prayer and we deal with these ailments

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.260
and other things that we might deal with,

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.740
but how important it is

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.420
that we would understand the eternal plane,

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.100
that we'd understand the importance of praying

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.980
for our brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.220
that they would grow in their walk with Christ,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.180
that their faith would be increased,

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.180
that they would have,

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.620
I mean, when you pray one for another,

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.180
you can pray that God would give them

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.460
sweet times of communion in his word and that they would grow

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.100
and I mean, we're going through those things

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.580
and we're encouraging one another and what a blessing.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.220
And Paul says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.660
Notice, lifting up holy hands,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.900
but then I want you to notice what he says without.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.620
Without wrath and doubting.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.380
Without wrath and doubting.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.940
There's no place where wrath and doubting would be present

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.540
and we'd be able to pray in the manner

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.900
in which we're supposed to.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.220
Prayer is not only asking God, but it's believing God.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.320
It's believing that he's able.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.920
See, the prayer of faith is what we speak of

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.400
in James chapter number five

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.760
and we understand that we're praying to the God

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.799
who is able to do exceeding abundantly above

00:39:07.799 --> 00:39:09.920
all that we ask or think.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.320
Dean shared with me a story a couple of years ago.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.359
I don't remember, I think it was a couple of years ago

00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:16.760
and Dean shares a lot of stories with me

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.119
and some I remember and some I do not,

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:21.960
but on one particular occasion, Dean,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.000
you'll know all the details.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.760
I don't need you to fill it in right now.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.679
If somebody is interested,

00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:27.080
they could come and speak to you,

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.739
but I believe it was in California

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:31.840
where there was someone that needed a mountain moved.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.640
Do you remember sharing this story with me?

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.500
And they had this, and it was gonna cost a lot of money

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.299
to get all of this soil, this dirt, this mountain,

00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:41.920
if you will, to have it removed,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.840
to bring in the workers that would be necessary

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.480
and the front loaders and the dump trucks

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.559
and all of those things that would be necessary

00:39:49.559 --> 00:39:51.280
just cost a lot of money.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.859
And they said, you know, we should pray about this

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:56.299
and not too long after they were praying about it,

00:39:56.299 --> 00:39:58.340
the county decided that there was some kind

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.900
of development project that had to happen

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.900
and they needed to.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.420
move all of that stuff. And they just came in and moved it all. That's pretty

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.460
neat story. And it's not just something somebody made up, it's a real account of

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.900
something that happened in a local area with a church that was there. And the

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:21.060
reality is that we, as we go to God in prayer, we ought not to enter in with a

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:27.780
spirit of doubting. We enter in with a spirit of faith, believing that God is

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.700
able, believing that He changes the hearts of men. When we read the Word of

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.420
God and we see throughout the history of mankind, and we see throughout the

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.700
examples that He's given us and recorded for us in the Word of God, and we

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.900
see how God worked in miraculous ways. What does it do? It increases our faith.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:54.920
That we go to God in prayer, believing that He's able. You don't understand the

00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:00.560
situation. The problem, and I say this with all humility, is that the person

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:07.920
that says that doesn't understand God. It's really the situation. Because it

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:13.520
doesn't matter how big the situation might be, our God is greater. It doesn't

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.600
matter how big the problem might seem to be from our perspective. And see, that's

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.640
one of the difficulties as we look at our problems as being little or big

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.840
based upon our perspective. But all of our problems are little compared to God.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:34.080
Amen? Because He's able. We find this truth. Notice in 1 John 5. Turn

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:41.280
there if you will. We'll conclude with this passage of Scripture. In 1 John

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:50.880
5, I want you to notice in verses 14 and 15. What great promise that we

00:41:50.880 --> 00:42:02.080
have here. Remember, as a believer, as a child of God, prayer is our distinct

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:11.960
privilege. And here's what 1 John 5, verse number 14. Notice what John says.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:17.840
And this is the confidence that we have in Him. Now I want you to just circle that

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.640
word confidence or underline it or something. Take note of it. Because it's

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:30.320
important for us to have confidence. This assurance. Being assured of this thing

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.200
that is being spoken of. And John says this is the confidence that we have in

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:43.400
Him. That if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. Now you might

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.000
want to underline that according to His will. Amen? By the way, how do we know

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.160
what His will is? Well, we better get into the Word of God. Because when we get

00:42:53.160 --> 00:43:00.320
into the Word of God, we understand that God reveals to us His will. We find here

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.680
that even as we mentioned in 1 Timothy chapter number 2, that He spoke

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.120
about that general will of God for men to be saved. You know that when you're

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.960
praying for the salvation of an individual, that you are praying

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.840
according to the will of God. When we have in our prayer list a list of people

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.160
that we're praying for that are lost, that need to come to Christ in faith,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.600
that we are praying according to the will of God. And we see here it says that

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.360
if we ask anything, this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:40.680
we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:47.200
heareth us, now look at that word know. See, throughout the Scriptures we find this

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.160
very important thing. God wants His people to be informed. He doesn't want us

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.320
to be ignorant. Paul actually uses the terminology many times, I would not have

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:03.400
you to be ignorant brethren. We see that the understanding and the truth is that

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.280
we are to be informed people. We are to know some things. In fact, in the book of

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.720
1 John, there are several things that he deals with, one of which is found in the

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.960
precious truth of verse number 13, which just precedes this particular subject

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.080
that we're dealing with on prayer. But he says, these things have I written unto

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.840
you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.720
eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. See, God wants us

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.520
to know that we're His children. He wants us to have that assurance. He wants us to

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.360
know it. There are some that would say, oh that's awful prideful for you to say

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.080
that you know that you're going to heaven when you die. No, there's

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.080
absolutely no pride involved because it's not of my own merit. It's all

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.880
because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, and He wants me to know.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:54.760
He wants us to know some things, it says, and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever

00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:02.600
we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. What a

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:09.360
joy to understand the promise here in verses 14 and 15 with regard to the

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:15.760
subject matter of prayer. We can trust that God is at work. Can I tell you this

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.560
evening, you may not see how God is working. You may not fully understand

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.680
what God is doing on the other end. You may not know how God is working in and

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:31.760
through that circumstance. It may take years of laboring in prayer, but we can

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.800
rest assured that if we're praying according to His will, that we have this

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:42.400
confidence that He hears us and that He is able. And we find that yes, there are

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:47.320
times in which the answer from God, as we've spoken of this morning briefly

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.240
from 2nd Corinthians chapter number 12, when Paul is told, my grace is

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:58.240
sufficient for thee. No Paul, I'm not gonna remove that thorn that you have in

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.280
your flesh, though you've asked, you've besought thrice for that thing, that it

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:07.420
might depart from you. No, because my grace is sufficient for thee. And he

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:13.800
says that my strength is made perfect in weakness. When that answer comes, we just

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.280
continue to walk forward and understand what Paul says. He says, most gladly

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:23.760
therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.480
rest upon me. Verse number 10 of that passage of Scripture says, therefore I

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.600
take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:40.280
persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:48.440
This evening, prayer as our first response. I believe that this evening, not

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.600
only for those that are gathered here locally, but even for those that are

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:58.920
tuned in via live stream, I believe that most all of us, I dare say every single

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.920
one of us, would say we believe in the importance of prayer. We believe that

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.400
prayer is a privilege of the child of God. But if we'd be honest this evening,

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:20.720
many times in our lives, prayer is not our first response. Far too often we lean

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.960
on our own understanding. I'm guilty of prayer not always being my first

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.960
response. Let's try to figure this out. Let's try to have a meeting, call

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:39.320
somebody, discuss something, figure this out. When our first response should be to

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:45.840
drop on our knees and to seek the face of God, knowing that He is able, knowing

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.960
that He has told us that it pleases Him. Oh, that we would be engaged, as we

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.240
noticed in the text of Scripture, in the ministry of intercessory prayer one for

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.080
another. But even as I mentioned to you, it's easier for me to pray for you than

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.240
it is for me to pray for those in the elected officials. But we have a biblical

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.120
mandate, a responsibility to pray for them. And I want to encourage you to

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.000
understand that this is acceptable in the sight of God. It's pleasing. It's good

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.320
and acceptable in the sight of God. And this evening, we find this exhortation

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:29.160
that Paul gives to Timothy here in 1 Timothy 2, prayer as a first response. Oh,

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:35.640
that we would be people of prayer. J. Sidlow Baxter said this with regard to

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:41.840
prayer. He said, men may spurn my appeal, reject our message, despise our persons,

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:50.040
but they are helpless against our prayers. Sometimes we say something like

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:57.040
this, I'll pray for you. And can I tell you, at times it almost seems as the one

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:03.240
saying those words, that it's almost inadequate for the situation. Because

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:11.040
we've been cultured to think that there's something I should do. But the

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.640
greatest thing that we could do for someone is to pray for them. To pray for

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:22.520
them. And when someone says to you, I'm praying for you, or I will pray for you,

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:27.119
I hope that that brings great comfort to your heart. And that you understand that

00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:33.360
that is an eternal investment that's being made on my behalf. That someone

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:38.600
would engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer. Paul said, brethren,

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:44.480
pray for us. Prayer as a first response. Father, we love you. We thank you for

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:51.000
loving us. God, I pray that you would help me. I mentioned at the beginning of this

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:57.559
message tonight that I was preaching to myself. And that I was seeking to help

00:49:57.559 --> 00:50:01.880
those who were here and those that were listening. God, that's my desire.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.320
That's my prayer.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.080
I pray that, Lord, You'd help us

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.360
in this area of prayer.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.140
That prayer would be our first response.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:20.860
So often, I've been guilty.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:25.380
I dare say many of us have been guilty

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.820
of understanding the great privilege of prayer,

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.300
of understanding the power of prayer,

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.220
and understanding that You delight in answering prayer,

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.100
but quite simply failing to pray.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.040
Lord, help us.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.660
We say with the disciples in Luke,

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.980
Lord, teach us to pray.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.940
We pray that You'd have Your will and way in our lives tonight.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:00.020
Help us, Lord, to do business with You.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.780
To allow You, even as we sang that last hymn this evening,

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.780
to allow You to have Your way with us.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:11.940
That we'd be honest and transparent before You.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.620
We'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.
