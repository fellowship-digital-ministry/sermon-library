1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
be a blessing to you, and that the Lord will use His Word to minister to our hearts as

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,800
only He can.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,520
The text of Scripture that is before us in Acts 16, we'll be looking at verses 11 down

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,239
through the end of the chapter, verse 34, and we won't get quite all the way through

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,559
the end of the chapter, but as you look at Acts 16, it is in this text of Scripture that

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:28,719
the Lord provides us with the details of the ministry of Paul and Silas there in Philippi.

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,080
And of course, as you study through the New Testament, you'll read the book of Philippians,

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,439
and you find that it's here in Acts 16 when the gospel first arrived to the city of Philippi,

9
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,680
and then a church is established because souls are saved and lives are changed, and later

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,500
on the Lord would have Paul write a letter back to the church at Philippi and providing

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,240
them with instruction, and we're certainly thankful for this local church.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm thankful that God uses His Word to impact individuals, to impact regions, and we see

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,080
in Acts 16 the impact that the gospel can have.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,339
We find that the ministry in Philippi, just as the case was for many other cities in which

15
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:18,519
Paul and others would travel and take the gospel, we understand that the ministry was

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:26,220
met with opposition, and eventually the opposition in Acts 16 will result in Paul and Silas

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,120
being imprisoned, and really that's where we're going to try to get to this morning

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,279
in dealing with the circumstances with regard to their time in prison, and then of course

19
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:39,800
their interaction with the jailer.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,599
As we look at Acts 16 in the beginning verses that we'll look at this morning, we find that

21
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,519
really the circumstances that lead up to the primary focus of the message are provided

22
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,620
to us.

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,080
It gives us some insight with regard to the interaction that we will later read of between

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,279
Paul and the jailer.

25
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:03,959
Notice with me in verse number 11, as we begin reading, the Bible says this,

26
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:11,339
Therefore, loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracea, and the

27
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:18,039
next day to Neapolis, and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,

28
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,839
and a colony.

29
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,119
And we were in that city abiding certain days.

30
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:26,639
And so we begin reading, and we see the arrival into the city.

31
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:32,039
We find that God will give us certain people that are encountered along the way in the

32
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,039
next several verses, and we find that as we look at this text of Scripture that there

33
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,800
are several people that we'll make note of that have interactions with Paul and Silas

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
on this missionary journey.

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,080
But let me skip all the way down to verse number 30 and look at the Philippian jailer,

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
and I want you to notice what he says.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,119
We'll use it for the title of the message this morning and get right into it.

38
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,520
The Bible says this in verse number 30,

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,039
And brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

40
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,759
What a great question.

41
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,720
The question requires an answer, and we'll see that Paul is able to stand up with great

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,940
boldness and provide an answer, and we'll focus on that in just a few moments.

43
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,779
But as they arrive in the city of Philippi, as we noted in verse 11 and 12, they first

44
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:21,380
encounter and meet an individual by the name of Lydia.

45
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,179
Notice in verses 13 through 15, God tells us of what takes place.

46
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:31,300
And on the Sabbath, we went out of the city by a riverside where prayer was wont to be

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
made.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,779
And we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither.

49
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:40,820
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,899
God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were

51
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,520
spoken of Paul.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,619
And when she was baptized in her household, she besought us, saying, If you have judged

53
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:57,539
me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there.

54
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,699
And she constrained us.

55
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:05,380
And so we find that Lydia is there with others, and her family obviously is impacted as well,

56
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,360
as we note in verse number 15.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,960
But we find that the Bible says that she attended unto the things which were spoken

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,679
of Paul at the end of verse number 14.

59
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:22,040
God does not include here in Acts 16 the actual message that Paul preached, but we understand

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,519
that as we follow and trace the steps of the Apostle Paul through the book of Acts, we

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,320
find that he would go from city to city and from opportunity to opportunity, and he would

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,920
preach the truth of the gospel.

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,959
In fact, over in Acts 17, maybe on the same page of your Bible or a page over, the Bible

64
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,760
tells us of the arrival to the city of Thessalonica, and it says in verse number 2 that Paul, as

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,799
his manner was, that was his behavior, this was the manner of Paul, he went in unto them

66
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:59,440
in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them, notice what it says, out of the Scriptures.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,119
And so he was using the word of God, and it says that he was doing this in verse number

68
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,480
3, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:16,239
dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

70
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:22,040
No doubt the message that Paul would preach in Philippi, the things which Lydia heard

71
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Paul speak of, it was the gospel.

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,600
And Paul is preaching and giving the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as his manner

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
was.

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,519
And the Bible then tells us that she was baptized and her household.

75
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,760
Why was it that she was baptized?

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,839
Well, because she had trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior, she was saved.

77
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,760
And after trusting Christ as her Savior, she wanted to identify with Christ and be baptized,

78
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,440
understanding that baptism cannot save you, baptism doesn't play part of the salvation,

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,880
it's all through the blood of Jesus Christ.

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,079
And she, in obedience, followed the Lord in believers' baptism.

81
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,559
Shortly thereafter, now I want you to just pause with me just for a moment and think

82
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,079
about the excitement.

83
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,399
Paul and Silas arriving to this new city, they come to Philippi, and there's no synagogue

84
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,959
there in Philippi, and they come and they're at the riverside, and they meet these ladies,

85
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,760
and they begin to preach the gospel, and Lydia gets saved, and her household, and they're

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,279
baptized, and she then says this, if you've judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come

87
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,519
into my house and abide there, and she constrained us.

88
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,799
I mean, this is a positive entrance into the city of Philippi.

89
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:40,119
It's exciting to see how God is working and what God is doing through the preaching of

90
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:43,559
the Word of God and through the ministry of Paul and Silas.

91
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:47,480
But we understand that we have an enemy, and we mentioned just a few moments ago about

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,279
the opposition that they would face, and we find that that begins in verse number 16.

93
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,799
It says, and it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with

94
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:07,779
a spirit of divination met us, which brought her master's much gain by soothsaying.

95
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,339
Notice what it says in verse 17, the same, this damsel that was possessed with a spirit

96
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:20,799
of divination, she followed, it says, the same followed Paul and us and cried, saying,

97
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:28,380
notice the message, these men are the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us the

98
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,079
way of salvation.

99
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,380
Now the message that she proclaimed was a true message.

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,679
It was the wrong vessel, but it's the true message that these men, Paul and Silas and

101
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:47,399
Luke, they're there, and they are the servants of the Most High God, and as this damsel says,

102
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:54,440
which show unto us, notice what she says, the way of salvation.

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,660
She does not say a way of salvation.

104
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,239
She does not say their way of salvation.

105
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:06,000
She says that they're the servants of the Most High God, and they've come with a message,

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,839
and the message which they have brought, they're showing unto us the way of salvation.

107
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm so thankful that Jesus Christ said in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the

108
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,279
life.

109
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,399
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

110
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,479
And we find that here, this damsel that was possessed with a spirit of divination, she

111
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,719
makes this proclamation, and we find that the Bible says, notice what it says in verse

112
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,520
18, and this did she many days.

113
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,400
Now, he doesn't tell us how many days we obviously, they could have.

114
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,239
The Bible just tells us for many days.

115
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,039
Can you imagine, again, get the setting, if you will.

116
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,400
They're traveling, they arrive in Philippi, they're preaching the gospel, we find that

117
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,239
Lydia and her household and others are, they're saved, they're baptized, they're praying,

118
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:05,599
and as Paul and Silas are ministering in Philippi, this lady, this young girl, she's following

119
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:11,119
after them, and she's saying that these men are the servants of the Most High God, and

120
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:18,400
they show us the way of salvation, and this happens for days.

121
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,039
And then the Bible tells us in verse number 18 that Paul, it says this, he was grieved,

122
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,640
he turned and said to the spirit, to this, remember, this damsel was possessed with a

123
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,359
spirit of divination, he says, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of

124
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:37,799
her, and he, that spirit, that came out the same hour.

125
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,000
Now this was a problem for these masters of this young lady, because the Bible had told

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,840
us in verse number 16 that she brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.

127
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,320
They made great profits because of this damsel that was possessed of this spirit of divination,

128
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,080
and now these masters, these that were profiting.

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
they're now very angry as to what has taken place.

130
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
And then we begin to read of the accusation

131
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,040
that leads to the imprisonment.

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
It says in verse 19,

133
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
and when her master saw that the hope of their gains

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
was gone, they caught Paul and Silas

135
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,880
and drew them into the marketplace under the rulers

136
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,480
and brought them to the magistrates saying,

137
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,480
these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city

138
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,640
and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive

139
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,920
neither to observe being Romans.

140
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,120
The multitude rose up together against them

141
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,720
and the magistrates rent off their clothes

142
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,280
and commanded to beat them.

143
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,360
When they had laid many stripes upon them,

144
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,240
they cast them into prison,

145
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
charging the jailer to keep them safely.

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,840
And so this is our first introduction to the jailer.

147
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,280
And we find that as we go and walk through

148
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,680
the passage of scripture,

149
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,240
again, there are people that have been met,

150
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,760
they've been there now for a period of time.

151
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,480
Again, this was happening for many days

152
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,120
and no doubt this jailer would have had some insight

153
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,640
as to what had been taken place in the city.

154
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,480
Can you imagine?

155
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
Obviously, the times and customs were different here

156
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,440
than what we are familiar with today.

157
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,800
If an individual or just a group of individuals

158
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
came into the city of Fairfax,

159
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,480
many of us probably wouldn't even know that they were here.

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Right?

161
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,280
But we find that there's a great situation

162
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,040
that's taking place here and no doubt

163
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,360
it's kind of the talk of the town

164
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
of these guys that have come in

165
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,720
and all that's taking place.

166
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
And the one that had the spirit of divination

167
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
was following for many days saying,

168
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,200
these men, they're the servants of the most high God

169
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,160
and they're here to show us the way of salvation.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,520
And then the rulers, or excuse me,

171
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,760
the owners and the masters,

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,960
they're upset after what had happened.

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
And there's obviously a buzz going around

174
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,360
of what's taking place with this group of men

175
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,080
that have entered into the city of Philippi.

176
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,640
We find that these men, Paul and Silas in particular

177
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,720
that are mentioned here, that they are beaten

178
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,920
and then they are cast into the prison

179
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,720
and when they're cast into the prison,

180
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,720
the jailer is given instructions to keep them safely.

181
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
So what does he do?

182
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
Well, in verse number 24, the Bible says,

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,280
who having received such a charge,

184
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,960
thrust them into the inner prison

185
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,160
and made their feet fast in the stocks.

186
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,000
All of a sudden, what had started as a great entrance

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,160
into the city of Philippi

188
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,600
has changed from a human perspective.

189
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,160
I mean, Lydia's there and man, she's saved

190
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,200
and she's baptized and they're praying

191
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
and things are going great

192
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,840
and then all of a sudden there's this accusation

193
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,880
and you're beaten and you're in prison

194
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
and from a human perspective,

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,880
we can say, man, how things change so quickly

196
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,000
and perhaps we've experienced things like that,

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,720
probably not being imprisoned

198
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,420
but we've experienced things changing in a hurry,

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,760
the circumstances of life

200
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
but we find that Paul and Silas understand something

201
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
about the God that they serve.

202
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Remember that damsel, she said,

203
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,760
these men, they're the servants of the most high God

204
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,080
and they understood something about their God.

205
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,960
You know what they understood?

206
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
That God is in control.

207
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,760
They understood that God has a plan.

208
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,880
They understand that God allowed this for a purpose,

209
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,720
for a reason.

210
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
It's very interesting to me

211
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,200
that as you would read the book of Philippians later on

212
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,640
when Paul would write back to this church,

213
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,600
he would tell them even as at that time of that writing,

214
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,680
he's in a Roman prison,

215
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,280
he says that the things that happened

216
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,240
have happened for the furtherance of the gospel.

217
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,560
That's exactly what happened in Philippi

218
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,180
and we find that Paul and Silas at midnight,

219
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,480
the Bible tells us in verse number 25

220
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,480
that they prayed and sang praises unto God.

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,160
Isn't that wonderful?

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Sometimes we don't respond to our difficulties

223
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
in the same way.

224
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,840
Sometimes we have circumstances that change on us,

225
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,440
things that aren't as favorable maybe as we'd like

226
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
and we find that here

227
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,640
because of what Paul and Silas understood about God

228
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,200
and who he is and what his purpose is,

229
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,040
we find that at midnight when they're in the inner prison,

230
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,200
when their feet are fast in the stalks,

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,160
that they're praying and they're singing to God.

232
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,000
And then notice the end of verse number 25,

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,960
and the prisoners heard them.

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,640
The prisoners heard them.

235
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,640
I don't know who the prisoners are.

236
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
I don't know what they were thinking.

237
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,080
I don't know why they were in prison,

238
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,760
but I know that it was impactful.

239
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,680
You know why I know that?

240
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,240
Because it'd be impactful to me.

241
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,480
If I see someone that's in there,

242
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,760
because most of the prisoners

243
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
are probably complaining about their lot,

244
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
about what's going on.

245
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,840
How they were unjustly put into this prison

246
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,600
and whatever their case would be.

247
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
But Paul and Silas,

248
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,040
they understand that they serve the most high God.

249
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,880
And in that prison,

250
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,200
they're praying and they're singing

251
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,080
and the prisoners heard them.

252
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,800
Now we're getting to the real central focus

253
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,920
of the message this morning.

254
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
The Bible says is they're singing and praying unto God.

255
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
In verse 26, I like the way that it says,

256
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,240
and suddenly there was a great earthquake.

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,480
Now think about those prisoners

258
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,520
that heard him praying and singing.

259
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,360
And then all of a sudden,

260
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,440
suddenly the Bible says there's a great earthquake.

261
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,320
And it says so that the foundations of the prison

262
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,680
were shaken and immediately all the doors were open

263
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,920
and everyone's bands were loosed.

264
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,640
Hallelujah.

265
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Amen.

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
That's exciting.

267
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,040
Of course, the prison, the keeper of the prison,

268
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,320
the jailer, he's concerned.

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,800
It says this in verse 27.

270
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,520
And again, I don't know how long Paul and Silas prayed

271
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,680
and were singing, praising unto God.

272
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,480
But we find that this earthquake comes,

273
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,440
the keeper of the prison,

274
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,240
waking out of a sleep and seeing the prison doors open.

275
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,920
He drew out a sword and would have killed himself

276
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,320
supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

277
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,920
We understand that being a jailer,

278
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,200
a prison guard was of great responsibility.

279
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,840
And if those that were entrusted to you,

280
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,480
those that you had the responsibility for,

281
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,800
if they escaped, whether it was really your fault or not,

282
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
the sentence for you is death.

283
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,920
We find that this Philippian jailer awaking out of sleep,

284
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,040
and I don't know how long he had been sleeping.

285
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm not sure if he heard some of the prayer time

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,840
and some of the singing of Paul and Silas.

287
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,960
And the Bible doesn't give us all the details,

288
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,360
but we know that the Bible says that he wakes up

289
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,200
and he sees that the prison doors are open.

290
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
And he is therefore believing

291
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,320
that the prisoners are now fled.

292
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
And so he's going to kill himself.

293
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,960
And the Bible says that Paul cried out with a loud voice

294
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
in verse number 28.

295
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
And here's what Paul said,

296
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,760
"'Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.'"

297
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
We are all here.

298
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
I can't help but believe

299
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,720
that Paul probably had some level of influence

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,600
on keeping all those prisoners there.

301
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,760
Because I'm kind of confident that when the doors opened up

302
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,920
that there were some prisoners that wanted to take flight,

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,840
run away.

304
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,400
And I just seem to believe

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
that as we look at the text of Scripture

306
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
that Paul had something to do

307
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
with keeping those prisoners there.

308
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,920
And he's able to say to this jailer

309
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,520
that's going to take his own life,

310
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
he says, "'Do thyself no harm.'"

311
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,720
Why?

312
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,000
He says, "'We're all here.'

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,120
Then he, the jailer, called for a light,

314
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,440
sprang in and came trembling

315
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,800
and fell down before Paul and Silas."

316
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,680
And here's what he says.

317
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
As he falls in their presence,

318
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,800
trembling, all of these events that had happened

319
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,640
over the days preceding,

320
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,600
leading to this earthquake and this encounter,

321
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
the Bible says,

322
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,799
"'And brought them out and said,

323
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,799
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

324
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,040
If you're taking notes this morning,

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,360
all of that was introduction.

326
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
Don't get nervous.

327
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
We only have two points this morning, amen?

328
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
We have lunch right on the property,

329
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
so I get to, no, I'm just teasing.

330
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,640
We do have lunch though.

331
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,080
But notice number one with me,

332
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,760
the sincerity of the request.

333
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,799
The sincerity of the request.

334
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,200
I believe, as I've mentioned,

335
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,640
as we've gone through the text of Scripture this morning,

336
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,880
I believe that this jailer, this Philippian jailer,

337
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
he had some knowledge of what had taken place

338
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,119
in the city of Philippi

339
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,720
in the days preceding this particular event.

340
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,679
He had some level of knowledge

341
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,000
with regard to the entrance of Paul and Silas and Luke

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
into the city of Philippi and the preaching

343
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
and all that had taken place.

344
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,720
And we find that now he has that responsibility

345
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
to put them and to keep them.

346
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,679
And we find that he now, after the earthquake,

347
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,440
and he's trembling, he says,

348
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,360
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

349
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,119
And as I believe the sincerity of the request that he makes,

350
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,360
I believe that this request reveals a few things to us.

351
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,520
If we look at the, I mean, really, it's sincere.

352
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,720
It's a very basic request.

353
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,720
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

354
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,920
I do to be saved?"

355
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,880
At least three things that I can look to here that are revealed to me as we look at this

356
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
request.

357
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,520
Number one is this.

358
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,880
He knew that he wasn't saved.

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,840
If he thought he was saved, if he knew that he was saved, he would not ask, sirs, what

360
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,420
must I do to be saved?

361
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,700
So the request, it's sincere, it's simple.

362
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,940
We find that the sincerity of the request reveals to me that he himself knew that he

363
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,740
wasn't saved.

364
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,700
He didn't have whatever they had been preaching about.

365
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,360
This way of salvation, remember, that's what this damsel was saying, these are the servants

366
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,700
of the Most High God, and they've come to show us the way of salvation, this being saved,

367
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,060
this idea of being saved, and Lydia and whomever else in the city of Philippi had been saved,

368
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,980
he recognized that he wasn't saved.

369
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,380
Not only did he recognize that he wasn't saved, but I believe the request reveals to us that

370
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,140
he knew that he had to be saved.

371
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,500
That's a good recognition, by the way.

372
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:29,100
Sirs, notice what he says, what must, must, must I do to be saved?

373
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,820
He recognized that he wasn't saved, but he recognized I need to be saved.

374
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't have what you're speaking of.

375
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,700
I don't have that assurance.

376
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,060
I don't have that peace.

377
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,060
I don't have salvation.

378
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,980
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

379
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,980
He came in trembling.

380
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,020
The Bible says that he brings them out, and as he falls down before them, I mean, in your

381
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,340
mind's eye, again, for some of us this morning, this is a very familiar passage of Scripture,

382
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,860
but I want you to see in your mind's eye all that has taken place as we've walked through

383
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,900
the passage, and as Paul and Silas are there, and this man has fallen down before them,

384
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,860
and he says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

385
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:28,540
There was a measure of urgency in his request because he knew that he wasn't saved, and

386
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,540
he knew that he had to be saved.

387
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Let me say this, the request that is made reveals to us that he knew that Paul had the

388
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,900
answer to the question.

389
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm glad he went to the right person.

390
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,180
Amen?

391
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,620
You know, there are some, the Bible refers to them as being false teachers.

392
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,140
The Old Testament talks about false prophets.

393
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,340
In fact, the New Testament tells us that there are, as there were false prophets, speaking

394
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,300
of the Old Testament, so there will be false teachers.

395
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:21,540
I'm so thankful that this Philippian jailer didn't ask the wrong person the question.

396
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,780
We had somebody visit our church years ago, and they said this, I have no idea why I'm

397
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,020
here, but they knew they were lost.

398
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,420
And I said, perhaps it's this, that God allowed you to come here because He knew that we'd

399
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,900
tell you the truth.

400
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,860
I don't say that being prideful or boastful, I just say that because we have the Word of

401
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,580
God, and the truth of God's Word is what we want to deliver to those individuals.

402
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,220
And so we find that this Philippian jailer, he, in this request, again, the sincerity

403
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,460
of the request, in my mind's eye, I see him there before Paul and Silas and crying out

404
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,500
as he's trembling over the events of the days that have taken place, and now as they were

405
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,260
cast in the inner prison, and there's an earthquake, and all that has taken place,

406
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,780
he recognized he wasn't saved.

407
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:19,540
He recognized he must be saved, and he recognized that Paul had the answer.

408
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:27,980
Paul was a servant of the Most High God, and he had the answer that this man needed.

409
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,420
Now, I say to you at this particular time of the message that we have the opportunity

410
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:41,300
as we look at a passage like this to identify with one of two people in this passage.

411
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,460
All of us this morning, we can either be Paul in the passage, or we can be the jailer in

412
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,060
the passage.

413
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,140
Because when we boil it all down, in our world there are but two groups of people.

414
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,540
There are people that have been saved by the grace of God, and there are people that

415
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,180
have not been saved by the grace of God.

416
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,460
We would refer to that as being some that are saved and some that are lost, and that's

417
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,420
the very basic understanding of humanity.

418
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,500
See, sin is a universal condition.

419
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,540
It's not something that just we Americans have to deal with, or some…no, sin is universal

420
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,620
for all mankind.

421
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,780
After sin entered into the garden there in Genesis chapter number 3, the Bible tells

422
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,260
us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

423
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,180
And so this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture and we begin to look at the individuals,

424
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,920
the characters, if you will, within the passage of Scripture, I wonder this morning, would

425
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,940
we say, I identify with Paul, I've been saved, I'm not in prison right now, but I've been

426
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:56,780
saved, and let me put it this way, I've been entrusted with the gospel to deliver, because

427
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,300
that's what Paul was doing, to those that have not yet been saved.

428
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:10,020
Maybe there's someone here that honestly you would say, I'm like the jailer.

429
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm not saved.

430
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,460
I don't even know what it means to be saved.

431
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,260
I have never heard that term.

432
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,180
I don't know what that means.

433
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:24,060
I'm not saved, so I must identify with the jailer, because I too would say, sirs, what

434
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,080
must I do to be saved?

435
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:35,180
If you identify as, relate to Paul, I want you to say this, or I want you to recognize

436
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,900
this as we mention that this Philippian jailer knew that Paul had the answer.

437
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,300
You know what the Bible tells us?

438
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Paul writes this to the believers in Corinth.

439
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:50,580
He says, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

440
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,780
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

441
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,780
And Paul understood that he had been entrusted with the gospel, and he had the responsibility

442
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,900
to give that gospel.

443
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
He didn't want to hide it.

444
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,380
He wanted to proclaim it.

445
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:14,300
And so we find that this request from this jailer, we find that no doubt he's coming,

446
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,820
this is a man who is sincerely concerned about his own personal salvation.

447
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,940
Notice what he says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

448
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,420
At this particular moment in his life, he wasn't worried about anybody else.

449
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,220
He was worried about his own soul's salvation.

450
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,620
What must I do to be saved?

451
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,860
The sincerity of the request, he knew that he wasn't saved.

452
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,620
He knew that he had to be saved, and he knew that Paul had the answer.

453
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,680
Notice with me the response of Paul as it's given to us in verses 31 and 32.

454
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,140
We see number one, the sincerity of the request.

455
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,340
I want you to see number two with me, the simplicity of the response, the simplicity

456
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
of the response.

457
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,980
I'm so thankful that the gospel is easy.

458
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,700
It really is.

459
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,500
It costs Jesus everything, but the gospel is quite simple.

460
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 15, the gospel that I delivered unto you, he says

461
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,180
that Christ, He died according to the Scriptures.

462
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,860
He was buried, and He rose according to the Scriptures.

463
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,380
That's the gospel in a nutshell, the death, burial, and glorious resurrection of our Lord

464
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,300
and Savior Jesus Christ.

465
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,940
And I'm so thankful for the truth of the gospel, and we see the simplicity of the response.

466
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,900
See, Paul understood, Paul knew that salvation was through the Lord Jesus Christ.

467
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,140
Notice what he says in verse number 31.

468
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:58,140
The Bible says, and they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,

469
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,580
and thy house.

470
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:06,420
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.

471
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,780
So Paul understood that this man and his relatives could be saved by trusting the Lord Jesus

472
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,260
Christ as their personal Savior.

473
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
He understood the truth of the gospel.

474
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,780
Paul was saved by the very grace of God, and Paul understood that these individuals, the

475
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,660
jailer and his family, they too could be saved.

476
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm so thankful that when this man made this request, and he says, sirs, what must I do

477
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
to be saved?

478
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,860
I'm thankful that Paul said, sorry, you can't be.

479
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,060
Man, seriously?

480
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,340
I'm glad that he didn't say, you have to, and then give a whole list of all sorts of

481
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,260
things that he had to do, and had to keep doing.

482
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,060
No, he said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

483
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,540
And thou might, no, no, no, he says thou shalt.

484
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,780
Be saved in the notice where he says, and thy house, this verse of Scripture is often

485
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,060
taken out of context and misapplied.

486
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,700
Because they look at that last phrase and thy house and they carry with it this idea

487
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,820
that if you get saved in your house, you're going to be saved and so on and so forth.

488
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,860
Really what Paul is saying is that, listen, just as you can be saved by believing in the

489
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:32,500
Lord Jesus Christ, anyone in your house can be saved by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.

490
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,940
And we see that truth in verse number 32 because it says, and they spake unto him the word

491
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,020
of the Lord.

492
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,860
I'm so thankful that God's given us a Bible.

493
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,100
I understand that at this particular time when Paul was ministering in the city of Philippi

494
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:55,020
on this missionary journey, that they did not have the whole Bible as we have today.

495
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,620
But they had the Old Testament and we find that God used his word and Paul took the word

496
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:07,500
of the Lord and notice where it says, and to all that were in his house.

497
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,580
Can you imagine the meeting?

498
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,700
I mean, again, in my mind's eye, I see the Philippian jailer getting his family together,

499
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,660
almost like the experience that Peter had at Cornelius's house when Cornelius had all

500
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,980
the people ready and said, okay, tell us what we need to know.

501
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,660
Because Cornelius received a vision from God, but that vision did not save him.

502
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:35,180
That vision said, go see Peter and Peter will tell you what you need to do.

503
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:41,860
Peter came and they were ready and Peter preached the gospel and they got saved.

504
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,540
Praise the Lord.

505
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,980
And so Paul was there and Paul knew the power of the gospel.

506
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,020
Paul had experienced the power of the gospel.

507
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,500
Paul was lost.

508
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,940
Paul was religious.

509
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,620
Religion can't save you.

510
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,780
It just can't.

511
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,700
Religion is man's attempt to reach God.

512
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:11,740
But God in his grace and his mercy, he reached way down to man and offered salvation.

513
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:19,380
We find that Paul is giving this response and just as we mentioned in the request of

514
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,580
the jailer that there were some things that were revealed to us by his request, I notice

515
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,380
in the response of the apostle Paul that this too carries with it and reveals to us

516
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,700
some things that we must understand.

517
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,700
Number one, this, I want you to understand that Paul as he's responding to this Philippian

518
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,620
jailer, his response reveals to us this truth.

519
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,500
Number one, that Jesus came to save sinners.

520
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,240
That was the reason he came.

521
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,280
He says in Luke 19 that the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

522
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,760
Listen, if you're here this morning and you're lost, the reality is that I was in that place

523
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,680
once and everybody else that's in this building that would stand and say that they're saved

524
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:15,400
today at one point in their life, they too were lost.

525
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,240
But Jesus came to save the lost.

526
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,600
He came to save sinners.

527
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,240
You know what the Bible says in Matthew 1 and verse 21?

528
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,720
We think about Matthew 1 as the record of the birth of Christ and Matthew 2 and looking

529
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,720
at that during the month of December and certainly appropriate to do so, but it's interesting

530
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,120
in verse number 21 of Matthew 1, the Bible says, and she shall bring forth a son and

531
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,280
thou shalt call his name Jesus.

532
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,360
Why?

533
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:52,120
For he shall save his people from their sins.

534
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:59,740
They were looking for a deliverer from Rome, but Jesus provided so much more because they

535
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:05,680
had a sin issue and Jesus came to save sinners.

536
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,040
It's interesting that Paul would give this very testimony as he's writing to his son

537
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,240
in the faith, Timothy, in 1 Timothy chapter number one, we see that this response that

538
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Paul gives to the Philippian jailer reveals to us that Paul understood that Jesus came

539
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
to save sinners.

540
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,640
In fact, his name shall be called Jesus.

541
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Why?

542
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,320
For he shall save his people from their sins.

543
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,360
But then Paul gives this testimony in 1 Timothy chapter number one and he's speaking to Timothy

544
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,560
and he's giving us this truth and he says this in verse number 12 of 1 Timothy 1, and

545
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,440
I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful,

546
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,400
putting me into the ministry.

547
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:55,080
That's what Paul was at this point, but notice what he says in verse number 13, who was before,

548
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,880
because Paul too at one point was lost.

549
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,120
In fact, you can read of his conversion in Acts chapter number nine, who was before a

550
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,880
blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.

551
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:14,760
But then notice these words, but I obtained mercy, oh, our God is merciful.

552
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
He's merciful.

553
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,320
He says, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord, listen, not only

554
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,760
is our God gracious but, or merciful, but he's also gracious and notice what he says

555
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,640
about the grace of the Lord in verse number 14, it was exceeding abundant, isn't that

556
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
wonderful?

557
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,880
I mean, he didn't just say it was abundant, that would have been sufficient for us to

558
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,320
understand, but he says it's exceeding abundant.

559
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
That's the grace of God.

560
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,920
You know what Paul said to the believers in Rome?

561
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,940
He said, where sin did abound, grace so much the more.

562
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm thankful for God's grace.

563
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,440
We sing Mr. Don's favorite song, Amazing Grace.

564
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,960
Many of us know that song, and certainly God's grace is amazing.

565
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,080
Notice what he says, the grace of our Lord in verse 14 was exceeding abundant with faith

566
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,320
and love, which is in Christ Jesus.

567
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,760
Then notice what he says, this is a faithful saying, it's a truthful saying, and worthy

568
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:21,120
of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I

569
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
am chief.

570
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,960
You see, Paul understood as he's responding to this Philippian jailer that cries out and

571
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,400
says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

572
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,840
He recognized that he wasn't saved, he recognized that he needed to be saved, he knew that Paul

573
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,240
had the answer, and Paul says, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved

574
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,760
in thy house, and Paul's answer reveals to us that he understood that Jesus came to save

575
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
sinners.

576
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,840
Not only did Jesus come to save sinners, but let me say this, I believe that the response

577
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:58,400
of Paul reveals to us, number two, that Jesus desires to save you.

578
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
I'm so thankful that not only did he come to save sinners, but he wants to save you.

579
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,600
If you're lost, he wants to save you.

580
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,520
I remember when I was lost and understood this truth, that he would love me so much

581
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,500
that he wanted to save me, that he did all of that for me.

582
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,160
He went to that cruel cross, before he got to the cross, he suffered all that he suffered.

583
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Why?

584
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,480
Because he loved me so much, because he loved you so much, and he wants to save you.

585
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,760
Remember in 1 Timothy, we looked at chapter 1 and verse number 12 through 15, but look

586
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,800
in chapter number 2 and verse number 4.

587
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,560
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 4.

588
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Speaking of God, it says this in verse 3, for this is good and acceptable in the sight

589
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,280
of God our Savior, and then notice verse number 4, who, speaking of God our Savior, who will

590
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,960
have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

591
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,120
You know, God's will for mankind is that they would be saved.

592
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
He died for you.

593
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,720
If you're here this morning and you're lost, he died for you, he loves you, and he wants

594
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480
to save you.

595
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,960
And Paul understood that.

596
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,800
When that man said, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

597
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,480
And Paul responded, Paul was saying, listen, in his response he was saying, I know that

598
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,120
Jesus came to save sinners, and I know that Jesus wants to save you.

599
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,440
And then in Peter chapter 3, you don't need to turn there, but in verse number 9, there's

600
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,040
some conversation that's taking place about those that are saying, where is the coming,

601
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,600
the appearing of God, and the promise of His appearing, and the text of Scripture, Peter

602
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,880
responds and says this, that the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men

603
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
count slackness.

604
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,120
But then it says this, but He is long-suffering to us, Lord, and then it says this, not willing

605
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,880
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

606
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,160
That's another way of simply saying that they would be saved.

607
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,040
Why hasn't Christ returned yet?

608
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,480
Well, it's not time yet, because when it's time, He's going to come, but we know that

609
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,680
it says that He's long-suffering to us, Lord, not willing that any should perish.

610
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,000
There's still some people that need to be saved, and He still wants to save them.

611
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,560
And that's wonderful.

612
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,960
That's why we put such effort in sending missionaries all over the world, why?

613
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,040
Because Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, because He wants to save them.

614
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,640
Many of them don't know what they must do to be saved.

615
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,480
They may ask people, listen, there's people in our community, there's people that you

616
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,040
work with, there's people that I know, there's relatives that I have that they don't know

617
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,360
how to be saved.

618
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,400
God's given us the opportunity to give them the truth.

619
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,640
Paul's response reveals to us not only that Jesus came to save and Jesus desires to save,

620
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,880
but we find, number three, that the response reveals to us that Jesus is the only way to

621
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
be saved.

622
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
Now, I understand this morning.

623
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,840
that this is often not very well received in the day and age in which we live.

624
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,280
I understand that, but let God be true.

625
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,920
Let God be true, and every man a liar is what the Word of God says.

626
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,040
We find that, as I made note already, that damsel said, these men are the servants of

627
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,240
the Most High God who have come, they're showing us the way of salvation.

628
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,320
Jesus said, as I quoted earlier, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

629
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,840
No man comes unto the Father but by me.

630
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:40,280
Peter said this in Acts 4, in verse number 12, he said, neither is there salvation in

631
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,480
any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be

632
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
saved.

633
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Contextually, if you were to look back into verse number 10, we know that the name that

634
00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Peter is referring to in verse number 12 is the name of Jesus Christ.

635
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,080
For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift

636
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,000
of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

637
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,880
Jesus is the only way to be saved.

638
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,920
You know, there are people today, unfortunately, that are, they've been deceived.

639
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,920
It ought to break your heart, by the way, to see people that truly desire, but they've

640
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,960
been asking the wrong people for the answer to the question.

641
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,200
They've been led astray.

642
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,640
They don't know the truth of the gospel, and this morning we have the truth of the gospel,

643
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,920
and Jesus is the only way to be saved.

644
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,040
You've seen with the kids, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way.

645
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,320
No other way, no other way, Jesus is the only way.

646
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm so thankful that someone told me about Jesus.

647
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Amen?

648
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,560
What a glorious truth.

649
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,080
And then finally, the simplicity of the response, Jesus came to save sinners, Jesus desires

650
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,520
to save you, Jesus is the only way to be saved.

651
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,680
And here's what I find in this response, that Jesus will save you.

652
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,040
Notice what Paul said in Acts 16 and verse number 31.

653
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:32,800
He said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

654
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,160
It was certain.

655
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,760
Paul wasn't kind of, well, I think this might be the way.

656
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,920
No, no, he was confident in the very truth that he was delivering.

657
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,400
The Bible tells us in Romans 10 and verse number 13, for whosoever, I love that word,

658
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:57,520
it means anyone, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

659
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Isn't that precious?

660
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Shall be saved.

661
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,480
Hebrews chapter number 7 and verse number 25, it's a precious verse of Scripture, and

662
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,960
we find that there, we think about the truth of our Lord, and it says this, wherefore,

663
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,520
he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever

664
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,120
liveth to make intercession for them.

665
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,940
He is able to save.

666
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:26,040
There is no one that's too far that God is not able to save.

667
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,960
The songwriter said, you don't know what a sinner I am, and the response is, but I know

668
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,920
what a Savior we have.

669
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Isn't that wonderful?

670
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,240
I mean, Paul said as we read it there in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15, this is a faithful

671
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,600
saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

672
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,040
of whom I am chief.

673
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
But God's grace was greater and he saved me.

674
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,560
So this morning, we look in Acts 16 and we see the request, we see the response, and

675
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,560
then notice quickly as we finish out the text of Scripture.

676
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,280
In verse 33 and 34 of Acts 16, it says, and he took them the same hour of the night.

677
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,200
This is the jailer, and he washed their stripes.

678
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,700
Notice what it says, and was baptized he in all his straight way.

679
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,900
When he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them and rejoiced, believing

680
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,760
in God with all his house.

681
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,720
You know what happened to this Philippian jailer?

682
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,040
He got saved.

683
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,880
He got saved by the grace of God.

684
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,520
Because Paul and Silas were accused of causing problems in Philippi and they were cast into

685
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,000
prison and they sang and they praised God and they prayed and there was an earthquake

686
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,920
and this man said, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

687
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,840
Paul answers the question and this man is gloriously saved.

688
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,120
I remember when I got saved.

689
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,480
I hope you never forget the day that you got saved.

690
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,720
I hope you never forget the grace of God.

691
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,700
But maybe, just maybe this morning, there's someone that's not saved.

692
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,880
Whether they're here locally or watching via live stream, they've never trusted the Lord

693
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
Jesus Christ.

694
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,260
They don't have confidence of heaven.

695
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,820
I'm so thankful that when I take my final breath here on this earth, that I will be

696
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,820
in heaven with my Savior.

697
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,460
And I don't say that because of anything that I've done, but all because of what He's done.

698
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,300
Because Paul said this, I'm willing and I'm confident.

699
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,100
He says this, rather to be present with the Lord, absent from the body and to be present

700
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,100
with the Lord.

701
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:51,180
For to live as Christ, to die as gain, I'm going to be with Christ forevermore.

702
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:59,500
This morning, if you relate best in Acts 16 to the Philippian jailer and you're not saved,

703
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,220
this morning, recognize that you're a sinner in need of a Savior.

704
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,780
Recognize that Jesus is the only Savior, for all have sinned and come short of the glory

705
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,780
of God.

706
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:17,220
As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.

707
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,420
Recognize that you need to be saved.

708
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,300
Recognize that Jesus is the only Savior.

709
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,460
You can't work your way to heaven.

710
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,660
You can't be part of a church to get to heaven.

711
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,420
You can't give money to get to heaven.

712
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,540
You can't do good things to get to heaven.

713
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,460
It's kind of like using the wrong currency at the grocery store.

714
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,820
They say that's not accepted here.

715
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:47,380
The only form of payment, if I can use that term this morning, to atone for your sin and

716
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,980
for my sin and the sin of the world, is what we sang about to start our service this morning,

717
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,940
the blood of Jesus Christ.

718
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,820
It's the blood.

719
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,900
It's the blood.

720
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,020
And Jesus did that for you because He loved you.

721
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,460
And this morning, I would say this, receive Him as your Savior, for whosoever shall call

722
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,980
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

723
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,060
In 2 Corinthians 6 and verse number 2, the Bible says, now is the accepted time, behold,

724
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,540
now is the day of salvation.

725
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:25,060
Oh, this morning, if you're not saved, would you trust Christ as your Savior?

726
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,820
Before it's eternally too late, trust Christ.

727
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,820
We don't know when we're going to die, but we do know that we have an appointment with

728
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,060
death.

729
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:39,980
The Bible says, and as it is appointed unto man, once to die, after this the judgment.

730
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,100
And so this morning, if you're not saved, it's our prayer that you trust Christ as your

731
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,380
Savior today.

732
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:51,380
This morning, if you're saved, I hope that you would rejoice in your salvation.

733
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,340
And I hope this morning that we would make a commitment to the Lord that we'd be like

734
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:02,340
Paul, and we would not allow for our gospel to be hid, but that we would proclaim the

735
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,340
truth.

736
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,140
Listen, it's a wonderful thing if someone comes and asks you, what must I do to be saved?

737
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,060
Oh, we better be ready to give an answer, amen?

738
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,260
And we live our lives in such a way that people would come and ask us, hey, you have

739
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,660
something that I don't have.

740
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,660
How can I have that?

741
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,180
I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

742
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,180
Let's pray together.

743
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,260
Father, we love you.

744
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,500
We thank you for loving us.

745
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,180
We thank you for the precious truth of your Word.

746
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,300
I thank you for this gospel account in Acts 16, and Lord, as we think of this record that

747
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,820
you've provided us with, I thank you for this jailer that got saved.

748
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:45,060
We trust in Christ as his Savior, and Lord, I pray that you would move and work in our

749
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,060
midst this morning.

750
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,260
God, would you have your will and way.

751
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,980
If there's one here that's not saved, Lord, I pray that they would trust Christ as their

752
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,980
Savior.

753
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,020
Lord, for everyone that's been born again, they've been saved by the blood of Christ.

754
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,740
I pray that you'd help us, Lord, to be faithful to proclaim the message.

755
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,940
In this moment of invitation, I pray that you'd have your will and way, that decisions

756
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,340
would be made that would please me, and we'll thank you for it.

757
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,580
In Christ's name we pray.
