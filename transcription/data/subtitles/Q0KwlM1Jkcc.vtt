WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
be a blessing to you, and that the Lord will use His Word to minister to our hearts as

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.800
only He can.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.520
The text of Scripture that is before us in Acts 16, we'll be looking at verses 11 down

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.239
through the end of the chapter, verse 34, and we won't get quite all the way through

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.559
the end of the chapter, but as you look at Acts 16, it is in this text of Scripture that

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:28.719
the Lord provides us with the details of the ministry of Paul and Silas there in Philippi.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.080
And of course, as you study through the New Testament, you'll read the book of Philippians,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.439
and you find that it's here in Acts 16 when the gospel first arrived to the city of Philippi,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.680
and then a church is established because souls are saved and lives are changed, and later

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.500
on the Lord would have Paul write a letter back to the church at Philippi and providing

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.240
them with instruction, and we're certainly thankful for this local church.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm thankful that God uses His Word to impact individuals, to impact regions, and we see

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.080
in Acts 16 the impact that the gospel can have.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.339
We find that the ministry in Philippi, just as the case was for many other cities in which

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:18.519
Paul and others would travel and take the gospel, we understand that the ministry was

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:26.220
met with opposition, and eventually the opposition in Acts 16 will result in Paul and Silas

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.120
being imprisoned, and really that's where we're going to try to get to this morning

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.279
in dealing with the circumstances with regard to their time in prison, and then of course

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:39.800
their interaction with the jailer.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.599
As we look at Acts 16 in the beginning verses that we'll look at this morning, we find that

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.519
really the circumstances that lead up to the primary focus of the message are provided

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:51.620
to us.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.080
It gives us some insight with regard to the interaction that we will later read of between

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.279
Paul and the jailer.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.959
Notice with me in verse number 11, as we begin reading, the Bible says this,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:11.339
Therefore, loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracea, and the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:18.039
next day to Neapolis, and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.839
and a colony.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.119
And we were in that city abiding certain days.

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.639
And so we begin reading, and we see the arrival into the city.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.039
We find that God will give us certain people that are encountered along the way in the

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:36.039
next several verses, and we find that as we look at this text of Scripture that there

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.800
are several people that we'll make note of that have interactions with Paul and Silas

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.520
on this missionary journey.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080
But let me skip all the way down to verse number 30 and look at the Philippian jailer,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.720
and I want you to notice what he says.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.119
We'll use it for the title of the message this morning and get right into it.

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.520
The Bible says this in verse number 30,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.039
And brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.759
What a great question.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:08.720
The question requires an answer, and we'll see that Paul is able to stand up with great

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.940
boldness and provide an answer, and we'll focus on that in just a few moments.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.779
But as they arrive in the city of Philippi, as we noted in verse 11 and 12, they first

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.380
encounter and meet an individual by the name of Lydia.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.179
Notice in verses 13 through 15, God tells us of what takes place.

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:31.300
And on the Sabbath, we went out of the city by a riverside where prayer was wont to be

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.300
made.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.779
And we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither.

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.820
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.899
God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.520
spoken of Paul.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.619
And when she was baptized in her household, she besought us, saying, If you have judged

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.539
me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there.

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.699
And she constrained us.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:05.380
And so we find that Lydia is there with others, and her family obviously is impacted as well,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.360
as we note in verse number 15.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.960
But we find that the Bible says that she attended unto the things which were spoken

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.679
of Paul at the end of verse number 14.

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:22.040
God does not include here in Acts 16 the actual message that Paul preached, but we understand

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.519
that as we follow and trace the steps of the Apostle Paul through the book of Acts, we

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:33.320
find that he would go from city to city and from opportunity to opportunity, and he would

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.920
preach the truth of the gospel.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.959
In fact, over in Acts 17, maybe on the same page of your Bible or a page over, the Bible

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:46.760
tells us of the arrival to the city of Thessalonica, and it says in verse number 2 that Paul, as

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.799
his manner was, that was his behavior, this was the manner of Paul, he went in unto them

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:59.440
in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them, notice what it says, out of the Scriptures.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.119
And so he was using the word of God, and it says that he was doing this in verse number

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.480
3, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.239
dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:22.040
No doubt the message that Paul would preach in Philippi, the things which Lydia heard

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.880
Paul speak of, it was the gospel.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.600
And Paul is preaching and giving the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as his manner

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
was.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.519
And the Bible then tells us that she was baptized and her household.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.760
Why was it that she was baptized?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.839
Well, because she had trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior, she was saved.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.760
And after trusting Christ as her Savior, she wanted to identify with Christ and be baptized,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.440
understanding that baptism cannot save you, baptism doesn't play part of the salvation,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.880
it's all through the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.079
And she, in obedience, followed the Lord in believers' baptism.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.559
Shortly thereafter, now I want you to just pause with me just for a moment and think

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.079
about the excitement.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:11.399
Paul and Silas arriving to this new city, they come to Philippi, and there's no synagogue

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:15.959
there in Philippi, and they come and they're at the riverside, and they meet these ladies,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:21.760
and they begin to preach the gospel, and Lydia gets saved, and her household, and they're

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.279
baptized, and she then says this, if you've judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.519
into my house and abide there, and she constrained us.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:34.799
I mean, this is a positive entrance into the city of Philippi.

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:40.119
It's exciting to see how God is working and what God is doing through the preaching of

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.559
the Word of God and through the ministry of Paul and Silas.

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:47.480
But we understand that we have an enemy, and we mentioned just a few moments ago about

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.279
the opposition that they would face, and we find that that begins in verse number 16.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.799
It says, and it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:07.779
a spirit of divination met us, which brought her master's much gain by soothsaying.

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:13.339
Notice what it says in verse 17, the same, this damsel that was possessed with a spirit

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:20.799
of divination, she followed, it says, the same followed Paul and us and cried, saying,

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:28.380
notice the message, these men are the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us the

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.079
way of salvation.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:34.380
Now the message that she proclaimed was a true message.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.679
It was the wrong vessel, but it's the true message that these men, Paul and Silas and

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:47.399
Luke, they're there, and they are the servants of the Most High God, and as this damsel says,

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:54.440
which show unto us, notice what she says, the way of salvation.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.660
She does not say a way of salvation.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.239
She does not say their way of salvation.

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:06.000
She says that they're the servants of the Most High God, and they've come with a message,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.839
and the message which they have brought, they're showing unto us the way of salvation.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:21.959
I'm so thankful that Jesus Christ said in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.279
life.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:26.399
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:32.479
And we find that here, this damsel that was possessed with a spirit of divination, she

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:36.719
makes this proclamation, and we find that the Bible says, notice what it says in verse

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:41.520
18, and this did she many days.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.400
Now, he doesn't tell us how many days we obviously, they could have.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.239
The Bible just tells us for many days.

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:50.039
Can you imagine, again, get the setting, if you will.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:54.400
They're traveling, they arrive in Philippi, they're preaching the gospel, we find that

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.239
Lydia and her household and others are, they're saved, they're baptized, they're praying,

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:05.599
and as Paul and Silas are ministering in Philippi, this lady, this young girl, she's following

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:11.119
after them, and she's saying that these men are the servants of the Most High God, and

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:18.400
they show us the way of salvation, and this happens for days.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.039
And then the Bible tells us in verse number 18 that Paul, it says this, he was grieved,

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:27.640
he turned and said to the spirit, to this, remember, this damsel was possessed with a

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.359
spirit of divination, he says, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:37.799
her, and he, that spirit, that came out the same hour.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:43.000
Now this was a problem for these masters of this young lady, because the Bible had told

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.840
us in verse number 16 that she brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.320
They made great profits because of this damsel that was possessed of this spirit of divination,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.080
and now these masters, these that were profiting.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.160
they're now very angry as to what has taken place.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.400
And then we begin to read of the accusation

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.040
that leads to the imprisonment.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.200
It says in verse 19,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.200
and when her master saw that the hope of their gains

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.040
was gone, they caught Paul and Silas

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.880
and drew them into the marketplace under the rulers

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.480
and brought them to the magistrates saying,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.480
these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.640
and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.920
neither to observe being Romans.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.120
The multitude rose up together against them

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.720
and the magistrates rent off their clothes

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.280
and commanded to beat them.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.360
When they had laid many stripes upon them,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.240
they cast them into prison,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.200
charging the jailer to keep them safely.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.840
And so this is our first introduction to the jailer.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.280
And we find that as we go and walk through

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.680
the passage of scripture,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.240
again, there are people that have been met,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.760
they've been there now for a period of time.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.480
Again, this was happening for many days

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.120
and no doubt this jailer would have had some insight

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.640
as to what had been taken place in the city.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.480
Can you imagine?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.320
Obviously, the times and customs were different here

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.440
than what we are familiar with today.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.800
If an individual or just a group of individuals

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.280
came into the city of Fairfax,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.480
many of us probably wouldn't even know that they were here.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.320
Right?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.280
But we find that there's a great situation

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.040
that's taking place here and no doubt

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.360
it's kind of the talk of the town

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.920
of these guys that have come in

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.720
and all that's taking place.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.360
And the one that had the spirit of divination

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.120
was following for many days saying,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.200
these men, they're the servants of the most high God

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.160
and they're here to show us the way of salvation.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.520
And then the rulers, or excuse me,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.760
the owners and the masters,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.960
they're upset after what had happened.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.280
And there's obviously a buzz going around

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.360
of what's taking place with this group of men

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.080
that have entered into the city of Philippi.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.640
We find that these men, Paul and Silas in particular

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.720
that are mentioned here, that they are beaten

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.920
and then they are cast into the prison

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.720
and when they're cast into the prison,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.720
the jailer is given instructions to keep them safely.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.920
So what does he do?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.400
Well, in verse number 24, the Bible says,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.280
who having received such a charge,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.960
thrust them into the inner prison

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.160
and made their feet fast in the stocks.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.000
All of a sudden, what had started as a great entrance

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.160
into the city of Philippi

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.600
has changed from a human perspective.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.160
I mean, Lydia's there and man, she's saved

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.200
and she's baptized and they're praying

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.440
and things are going great

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.840
and then all of a sudden there's this accusation

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.880
and you're beaten and you're in prison

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.440
and from a human perspective,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.880
we can say, man, how things change so quickly

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.000
and perhaps we've experienced things like that,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.720
probably not being imprisoned

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.420
but we've experienced things changing in a hurry,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.760
the circumstances of life

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.760
but we find that Paul and Silas understand something

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.320
about the God that they serve.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.520
Remember that damsel, she said,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.760
these men, they're the servants of the most high God

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.080
and they understood something about their God.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.960
You know what they understood?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.960
That God is in control.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.760
They understood that God has a plan.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.880
They understand that God allowed this for a purpose,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.720
for a reason.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.240
It's very interesting to me

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.200
that as you would read the book of Philippians later on

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.640
when Paul would write back to this church,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.600
he would tell them even as at that time of that writing,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.680
he's in a Roman prison,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.280
he says that the things that happened

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.240
have happened for the furtherance of the gospel.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.560
That's exactly what happened in Philippi

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.180
and we find that Paul and Silas at midnight,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.480
the Bible tells us in verse number 25

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.480
that they prayed and sang praises unto God.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.160
Isn't that wonderful?

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.600
Sometimes we don't respond to our difficulties

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.320
in the same way.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.840
Sometimes we have circumstances that change on us,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.440
things that aren't as favorable maybe as we'd like

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.120
and we find that here

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.640
because of what Paul and Silas understood about God

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.200
and who he is and what his purpose is,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.040
we find that at midnight when they're in the inner prison,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.200
when their feet are fast in the stalks,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.160
that they're praying and they're singing to God.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.000
And then notice the end of verse number 25,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.960
and the prisoners heard them.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.640
The prisoners heard them.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.640
I don't know who the prisoners are.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.560
I don't know what they were thinking.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.080
I don't know why they were in prison,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.760
but I know that it was impactful.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.680
You know why I know that?

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.240
Because it'd be impactful to me.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.480
If I see someone that's in there,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.760
because most of the prisoners

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.320
are probably complaining about their lot,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.120
about what's going on.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.840
How they were unjustly put into this prison

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.600
and whatever their case would be.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.160
But Paul and Silas,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.040
they understand that they serve the most high God.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.880
And in that prison,

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.200
they're praying and they're singing

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.080
and the prisoners heard them.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.800
Now we're getting to the real central focus

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.920
of the message this morning.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.120
The Bible says is they're singing and praying unto God.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.360
In verse 26, I like the way that it says,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.240
and suddenly there was a great earthquake.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.480
Now think about those prisoners

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.520
that heard him praying and singing.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.360
And then all of a sudden,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.440
suddenly the Bible says there's a great earthquake.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.320
And it says so that the foundations of the prison

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.680
were shaken and immediately all the doors were open

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.920
and everyone's bands were loosed.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.640
Hallelujah.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.320
Amen.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320
That's exciting.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.040
Of course, the prison, the keeper of the prison,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.320
the jailer, he's concerned.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.800
It says this in verse 27.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.520
And again, I don't know how long Paul and Silas prayed

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.680
and were singing, praising unto God.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.480
But we find that this earthquake comes,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.440
the keeper of the prison,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.240
waking out of a sleep and seeing the prison doors open.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.920
He drew out a sword and would have killed himself

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.320
supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.920
We understand that being a jailer,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.200
a prison guard was of great responsibility.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.840
And if those that were entrusted to you,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.480
those that you had the responsibility for,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.800
if they escaped, whether it was really your fault or not,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800
the sentence for you is death.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.920
We find that this Philippian jailer awaking out of sleep,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.040
and I don't know how long he had been sleeping.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.760
I'm not sure if he heard some of the prayer time

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.840
and some of the singing of Paul and Silas.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.960
And the Bible doesn't give us all the details,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.360
but we know that the Bible says that he wakes up

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.200
and he sees that the prison doors are open.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.400
And he is therefore believing

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.320
that the prisoners are now fled.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.320
And so he's going to kill himself.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.960
And the Bible says that Paul cried out with a loud voice

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.160
in verse number 28.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.760
And here's what Paul said,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.760
"'Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.'"

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.200
We are all here.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.880
I can't help but believe

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.720
that Paul probably had some level of influence

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.600
on keeping all those prisoners there.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.760
Because I'm kind of confident that when the doors opened up

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.920
that there were some prisoners that wanted to take flight,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.840
run away.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.400
And I just seem to believe

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.840
that as we look at the text of Scripture

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.200
that Paul had something to do

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.160
with keeping those prisoners there.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.920
And he's able to say to this jailer

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.520
that's going to take his own life,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.400
he says, "'Do thyself no harm.'"

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.720
Why?

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.000
He says, "'We're all here.'

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.120
Then he, the jailer, called for a light,

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.440
sprang in and came trembling

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.800
and fell down before Paul and Silas."

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.680
And here's what he says.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.640
As he falls in their presence,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.800
trembling, all of these events that had happened

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.640
over the days preceding,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.600
leading to this earthquake and this encounter,

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600
the Bible says,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.799
"'And brought them out and said,

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:40.799
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.040
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.360
all of that was introduction.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.320
Don't get nervous.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.480
We only have two points this morning, amen?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.880
We have lunch right on the property,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.520
so I get to, no, I'm just teasing.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.640
We do have lunch though.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.080
But notice number one with me,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.760
the sincerity of the request.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.799
The sincerity of the request.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.200
I believe, as I've mentioned,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.640
as we've gone through the text of Scripture this morning,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.880
I believe that this jailer, this Philippian jailer,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.840
he had some knowledge of what had taken place

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.119
in the city of Philippi

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:16.720
in the days preceding this particular event.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.679
He had some level of knowledge

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:23.000
with regard to the entrance of Paul and Silas and Luke

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.600
into the city of Philippi and the preaching

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.040
and all that had taken place.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.720
And we find that now he has that responsibility

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.520
to put them and to keep them.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.679
And we find that he now, after the earthquake,

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.440
and he's trembling, he says,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.360
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.119
And as I believe the sincerity of the request that he makes,

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:51.360
I believe that this request reveals a few things to us.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.520
If we look at the, I mean, really, it's sincere.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.720
It's a very basic request.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.720
"'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?''

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.920
I do to be saved?"

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:12.880
At least three things that I can look to here that are revealed to me as we look at this

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880
request.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.520
Number one is this.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.880
He knew that he wasn't saved.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.840
If he thought he was saved, if he knew that he was saved, he would not ask, sirs, what

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.420
must I do to be saved?

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.700
So the request, it's sincere, it's simple.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.940
We find that the sincerity of the request reveals to me that he himself knew that he

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.740
wasn't saved.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.700
He didn't have whatever they had been preaching about.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.360
This way of salvation, remember, that's what this damsel was saying, these are the servants

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.700
of the Most High God, and they've come to show us the way of salvation, this being saved,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.060
this idea of being saved, and Lydia and whomever else in the city of Philippi had been saved,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.980
he recognized that he wasn't saved.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.380
Not only did he recognize that he wasn't saved, but I believe the request reveals to us that

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.140
he knew that he had to be saved.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.500
That's a good recognition, by the way.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:29.100
Sirs, notice what he says, what must, must, must I do to be saved?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.820
He recognized that he wasn't saved, but he recognized I need to be saved.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.100
I don't have what you're speaking of.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.700
I don't have that assurance.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.060
I don't have that peace.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.060
I don't have salvation.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.980
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.980
He came in trembling.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:59.020
The Bible says that he brings them out, and as he falls down before them, I mean, in your

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.340
mind's eye, again, for some of us this morning, this is a very familiar passage of Scripture,

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.860
but I want you to see in your mind's eye all that has taken place as we've walked through

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:14.900
the passage, and as Paul and Silas are there, and this man has fallen down before them,

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.860
and he says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:28.540
There was a measure of urgency in his request because he knew that he wasn't saved, and

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.540
he knew that he had to be saved.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:42.540
Let me say this, the request that is made reveals to us that he knew that Paul had the

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.900
answer to the question.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.900
I'm glad he went to the right person.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.180
Amen?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.620
You know, there are some, the Bible refers to them as being false teachers.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.140
The Old Testament talks about false prophets.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.340
In fact, the New Testament tells us that there are, as there were false prophets, speaking

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.300
of the Old Testament, so there will be false teachers.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:21.540
I'm so thankful that this Philippian jailer didn't ask the wrong person the question.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.780
We had somebody visit our church years ago, and they said this, I have no idea why I'm

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.020
here, but they knew they were lost.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.420
And I said, perhaps it's this, that God allowed you to come here because He knew that we'd

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.900
tell you the truth.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.860
I don't say that being prideful or boastful, I just say that because we have the Word of

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:45.580
God, and the truth of God's Word is what we want to deliver to those individuals.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.220
And so we find that this Philippian jailer, he, in this request, again, the sincerity

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:58.460
of the request, in my mind's eye, I see him there before Paul and Silas and crying out

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.500
as he's trembling over the events of the days that have taken place, and now as they were

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.260
cast in the inner prison, and there's an earthquake, and all that has taken place,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.780
he recognized he wasn't saved.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:19.540
He recognized he must be saved, and he recognized that Paul had the answer.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:27.980
Paul was a servant of the Most High God, and he had the answer that this man needed.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:34.420
Now, I say to you at this particular time of the message that we have the opportunity

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:41.300
as we look at a passage like this to identify with one of two people in this passage.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.460
All of us this morning, we can either be Paul in the passage, or we can be the jailer in

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.060
the passage.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:55.140
Because when we boil it all down, in our world there are but two groups of people.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.540
There are people that have been saved by the grace of God, and there are people that

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.180
have not been saved by the grace of God.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.460
We would refer to that as being some that are saved and some that are lost, and that's

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.420
the very basic understanding of humanity.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.500
See, sin is a universal condition.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.540
It's not something that just we Americans have to deal with, or some…no, sin is universal

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.620
for all mankind.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.780
After sin entered into the garden there in Genesis chapter number 3, the Bible tells

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.260
us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:37.180
And so this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture and we begin to look at the individuals,

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.920
the characters, if you will, within the passage of Scripture, I wonder this morning, would

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:48.940
we say, I identify with Paul, I've been saved, I'm not in prison right now, but I've been

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:56.780
saved, and let me put it this way, I've been entrusted with the gospel to deliver, because

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:02.300
that's what Paul was doing, to those that have not yet been saved.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:10.020
Maybe there's someone here that honestly you would say, I'm like the jailer.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.600
I'm not saved.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.460
I don't even know what it means to be saved.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.260
I have never heard that term.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.180
I don't know what that means.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:24.060
I'm not saved, so I must identify with the jailer, because I too would say, sirs, what

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.080
must I do to be saved?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:35.180
If you identify as, relate to Paul, I want you to say this, or I want you to recognize

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.900
this as we mention that this Philippian jailer knew that Paul had the answer.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.300
You know what the Bible tells us?

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.700
Paul writes this to the believers in Corinth.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:50.580
He says, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.780
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.780
And Paul understood that he had been entrusted with the gospel, and he had the responsibility

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.900
to give that gospel.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.700
He didn't want to hide it.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.380
He wanted to proclaim it.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:14.300
And so we find that this request from this jailer, we find that no doubt he's coming,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.820
this is a man who is sincerely concerned about his own personal salvation.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:26.940
Notice what he says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:32.420
At this particular moment in his life, he wasn't worried about anybody else.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.220
He was worried about his own soul's salvation.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.620
What must I do to be saved?

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.860
The sincerity of the request, he knew that he wasn't saved.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.620
He knew that he had to be saved, and he knew that Paul had the answer.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.680
Notice with me the response of Paul as it's given to us in verses 31 and 32.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.140
We see number one, the sincerity of the request.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.340
I want you to see number two with me, the simplicity of the response, the simplicity

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.340
of the response.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.980
I'm so thankful that the gospel is easy.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.700
It really is.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:14.500
It costs Jesus everything, but the gospel is quite simple.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.500
Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 15, the gospel that I delivered unto you, he says

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:24.180
that Christ, He died according to the Scriptures.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.860
He was buried, and He rose according to the Scriptures.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.380
That's the gospel in a nutshell, the death, burial, and glorious resurrection of our Lord

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.300
and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.940
And I'm so thankful for the truth of the gospel, and we see the simplicity of the response.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.900
See, Paul understood, Paul knew that salvation was through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.140
Notice what he says in verse number 31.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:58.140
The Bible says, and they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.580
and thy house.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:06.420
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:12.780
So Paul understood that this man and his relatives could be saved by trusting the Lord Jesus

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.260
Christ as their personal Savior.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.260
He understood the truth of the gospel.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.780
Paul was saved by the very grace of God, and Paul understood that these individuals, the

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.660
jailer and his family, they too could be saved.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.100
I'm so thankful that when this man made this request, and he says, sirs, what must I do

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.100
to be saved?

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.860
I'm thankful that Paul said, sorry, you can't be.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.060
Man, seriously?

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.340
I'm glad that he didn't say, you have to, and then give a whole list of all sorts of

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.260
things that he had to do, and had to keep doing.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.060
No, he said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.540
And thou might, no, no, no, he says thou shalt.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:08.780
Be saved in the notice where he says, and thy house, this verse of Scripture is often

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.060
taken out of context and misapplied.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.700
Because they look at that last phrase and thy house and they carry with it this idea

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.820
that if you get saved in your house, you're going to be saved and so on and so forth.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.860
Really what Paul is saying is that, listen, just as you can be saved by believing in the

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:32.500
Lord Jesus Christ, anyone in your house can be saved by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:40.940
And we see that truth in verse number 32 because it says, and they spake unto him the word

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.020
of the Lord.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.860
I'm so thankful that God's given us a Bible.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.100
I understand that at this particular time when Paul was ministering in the city of Philippi

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:55.020
on this missionary journey, that they did not have the whole Bible as we have today.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.620
But they had the Old Testament and we find that God used his word and Paul took the word

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.500
of the Lord and notice where it says, and to all that were in his house.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.580
Can you imagine the meeting?

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.700
I mean, again, in my mind's eye, I see the Philippian jailer getting his family together,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.660
almost like the experience that Peter had at Cornelius's house when Cornelius had all

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.980
the people ready and said, okay, tell us what we need to know.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.660
Because Cornelius received a vision from God, but that vision did not save him.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:35.180
That vision said, go see Peter and Peter will tell you what you need to do.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:41.860
Peter came and they were ready and Peter preached the gospel and they got saved.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.540
Praise the Lord.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.980
And so Paul was there and Paul knew the power of the gospel.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.020
Paul had experienced the power of the gospel.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.500
Paul was lost.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.940
Paul was religious.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.620
Religion can't save you.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.780
It just can't.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.700
Religion is man's attempt to reach God.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:11.740
But God in his grace and his mercy, he reached way down to man and offered salvation.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:19.380
We find that Paul is giving this response and just as we mentioned in the request of

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.580
the jailer that there were some things that were revealed to us by his request, I notice

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:30.380
in the response of the apostle Paul that this too carries with it and reveals to us

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.700
some things that we must understand.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:37.700
Number one, this, I want you to understand that Paul as he's responding to this Philippian

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.620
jailer, his response reveals to us this truth.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.500
Number one, that Jesus came to save sinners.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.240
That was the reason he came.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:55.280
He says in Luke 19 that the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:01.760
Listen, if you're here this morning and you're lost, the reality is that I was in that place

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.680
once and everybody else that's in this building that would stand and say that they're saved

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:15.400
today at one point in their life, they too were lost.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.240
But Jesus came to save the lost.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.600
He came to save sinners.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.240
You know what the Bible says in Matthew 1 and verse 21?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.720
We think about Matthew 1 as the record of the birth of Christ and Matthew 2 and looking

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.720
at that during the month of December and certainly appropriate to do so, but it's interesting

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:39.120
in verse number 21 of Matthew 1, the Bible says, and she shall bring forth a son and

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.280
thou shalt call his name Jesus.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.360
Why?

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:52.120
For he shall save his people from their sins.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:59.740
They were looking for a deliverer from Rome, but Jesus provided so much more because they

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.680
had a sin issue and Jesus came to save sinners.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.040
It's interesting that Paul would give this very testimony as he's writing to his son

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:16.240
in the faith, Timothy, in 1 Timothy chapter number one, we see that this response that

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.240
Paul gives to the Philippian jailer reveals to us that Paul understood that Jesus came

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240
to save sinners.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.640
In fact, his name shall be called Jesus.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640
Why?

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.320
For he shall save his people from their sins.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.360
But then Paul gives this testimony in 1 Timothy chapter number one and he's speaking to Timothy

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:39.560
and he's giving us this truth and he says this in verse number 12 of 1 Timothy 1, and

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.440
I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.400
putting me into the ministry.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:55.080
That's what Paul was at this point, but notice what he says in verse number 13, who was before,

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.880
because Paul too at one point was lost.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:02.120
In fact, you can read of his conversion in Acts chapter number nine, who was before a

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.880
blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:14.760
But then notice these words, but I obtained mercy, oh, our God is merciful.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760
He's merciful.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.320
He says, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord, listen, not only

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.760
is our God gracious but, or merciful, but he's also gracious and notice what he says

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:32.640
about the grace of the Lord in verse number 14, it was exceeding abundant, isn't that

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640
wonderful?

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.880
I mean, he didn't just say it was abundant, that would have been sufficient for us to

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.320
understand, but he says it's exceeding abundant.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320
That's the grace of God.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.920
You know what Paul said to the believers in Rome?

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.940
He said, where sin did abound, grace so much the more.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.880
I'm thankful for God's grace.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.440
We sing Mr. Don's favorite song, Amazing Grace.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.960
Many of us know that song, and certainly God's grace is amazing.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.080
Notice what he says, the grace of our Lord in verse 14 was exceeding abundant with faith

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.320
and love, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.760
Then notice what he says, this is a faithful saying, it's a truthful saying, and worthy

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:21.120
of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120
am chief.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:27.960
You see, Paul understood as he's responding to this Philippian jailer that cries out and

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.400
says, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.840
He recognized that he wasn't saved, he recognized that he needed to be saved, he knew that Paul

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.240
had the answer, and Paul says, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.760
in thy house, and Paul's answer reveals to us that he understood that Jesus came to save

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.760
sinners.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.840
Not only did Jesus come to save sinners, but let me say this, I believe that the response

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:58.400
of Paul reveals to us, number two, that Jesus desires to save you.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.040
I'm so thankful that not only did he come to save sinners, but he wants to save you.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.600
If you're lost, he wants to save you.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.520
I remember when I was lost and understood this truth, that he would love me so much

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.500
that he wanted to save me, that he did all of that for me.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:20.160
He went to that cruel cross, before he got to the cross, he suffered all that he suffered.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160
Why?

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.480
Because he loved me so much, because he loved you so much, and he wants to save you.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.760
Remember in 1 Timothy, we looked at chapter 1 and verse number 12 through 15, but look

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.800
in chapter number 2 and verse number 4.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.560
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 4.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.560
Speaking of God, it says this in verse 3, for this is good and acceptable in the sight

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.280
of God our Savior, and then notice verse number 4, who, speaking of God our Savior, who will

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.960
have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:57.120
You know, God's will for mankind is that they would be saved.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120
He died for you.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.720
If you're here this morning and you're lost, he died for you, he loves you, and he wants

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.480
to save you.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.960
And Paul understood that.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.800
When that man said, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.480
And Paul responded, Paul was saying, listen, in his response he was saying, I know that

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:19.120
Jesus came to save sinners, and I know that Jesus wants to save you.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.440
And then in Peter chapter 3, you don't need to turn there, but in verse number 9, there's

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.040
some conversation that's taking place about those that are saying, where is the coming,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.600
the appearing of God, and the promise of His appearing, and the text of Scripture, Peter

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.880
responds and says this, that the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880
count slackness.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.120
But then it says this, but He is long-suffering to us, Lord, and then it says this, not willing

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.880
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.160
That's another way of simply saying that they would be saved.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.040
Why hasn't Christ returned yet?

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:05.480
Well, it's not time yet, because when it's time, He's going to come, but we know that

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.680
it says that He's long-suffering to us, Lord, not willing that any should perish.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:15.000
There's still some people that need to be saved, and He still wants to save them.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.560
And that's wonderful.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.960
That's why we put such effort in sending missionaries all over the world, why?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:28.040
Because Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, because He wants to save them.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.640
Many of them don't know what they must do to be saved.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.480
They may ask people, listen, there's people in our community, there's people that you

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.040
work with, there's people that I know, there's relatives that I have that they don't know

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.360
how to be saved.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.400
God's given us the opportunity to give them the truth.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:53.640
Paul's response reveals to us not only that Jesus came to save and Jesus desires to save,

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.880
but we find, number three, that the response reveals to us that Jesus is the only way to

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.880
be saved.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.560
Now, I understand this morning.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.840
that this is often not very well received in the day and age in which we live.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.280
I understand that, but let God be true.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.920
Let God be true, and every man a liar is what the Word of God says.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.040
We find that, as I made note already, that damsel said, these men are the servants of

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:28.240
the Most High God who have come, they're showing us the way of salvation.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.320
Jesus said, as I quoted earlier, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.840
No man comes unto the Father but by me.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.280
Peter said this in Acts 4, in verse number 12, he said, neither is there salvation in

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:46.480
any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480
saved.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.240
Contextually, if you were to look back into verse number 10, we know that the name that

00:40:51.240 --> 00:41:00.240
Peter is referring to in verse number 12 is the name of Jesus Christ.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.080
For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.000
of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.880
Jesus is the only way to be saved.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.920
You know, there are people today, unfortunately, that are, they've been deceived.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:25.920
It ought to break your heart, by the way, to see people that truly desire, but they've

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.960
been asking the wrong people for the answer to the question.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.200
They've been led astray.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:39.640
They don't know the truth of the gospel, and this morning we have the truth of the gospel,

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.920
and Jesus is the only way to be saved.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.040
You've seen with the kids, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.320
No other way, no other way, Jesus is the only way.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.360
I'm so thankful that someone told me about Jesus.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360
Amen?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.560
What a glorious truth.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.080
And then finally, the simplicity of the response, Jesus came to save sinners, Jesus desires

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.520
to save you, Jesus is the only way to be saved.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.680
And here's what I find in this response, that Jesus will save you.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.040
Notice what Paul said in Acts 16 and verse number 31.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:32.800
He said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.160
It was certain.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.760
Paul wasn't kind of, well, I think this might be the way.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.920
No, no, he was confident in the very truth that he was delivering.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.400
The Bible tells us in Romans 10 and verse number 13, for whosoever, I love that word,

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:57.520
it means anyone, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.520
Isn't that precious?

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520
Shall be saved.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:05.480
Hebrews chapter number 7 and verse number 25, it's a precious verse of Scripture, and

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.960
we find that there, we think about the truth of our Lord, and it says this, wherefore,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.520
he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.120
liveth to make intercession for them.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.940
He is able to save.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:26.040
There is no one that's too far that God is not able to save.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:31.960
The songwriter said, you don't know what a sinner I am, and the response is, but I know

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.920
what a Savior we have.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920
Isn't that wonderful?

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.240
I mean, Paul said as we read it there in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15, this is a faithful

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.600
saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.040
of whom I am chief.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.560
But God's grace was greater and he saved me.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.560
So this morning, we look in Acts 16 and we see the request, we see the response, and

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.560
then notice quickly as we finish out the text of Scripture.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:09.280
In verse 33 and 34 of Acts 16, it says, and he took them the same hour of the night.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.200
This is the jailer, and he washed their stripes.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.700
Notice what it says, and was baptized he in all his straight way.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.900
When he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them and rejoiced, believing

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.760
in God with all his house.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.720
You know what happened to this Philippian jailer?

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.040
He got saved.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:35.880
He got saved by the grace of God.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:41.520
Because Paul and Silas were accused of causing problems in Philippi and they were cast into

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.000
prison and they sang and they praised God and they prayed and there was an earthquake

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.920
and this man said, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.840
Paul answers the question and this man is gloriously saved.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.120
I remember when I got saved.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.480
I hope you never forget the day that you got saved.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.720
I hope you never forget the grace of God.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.700
But maybe, just maybe this morning, there's someone that's not saved.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.880
Whether they're here locally or watching via live stream, they've never trusted the Lord

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.880
Jesus Christ.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.260
They don't have confidence of heaven.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.820
I'm so thankful that when I take my final breath here on this earth, that I will be

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.820
in heaven with my Savior.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.460
And I don't say that because of anything that I've done, but all because of what He's done.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.300
Because Paul said this, I'm willing and I'm confident.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.100
He says this, rather to be present with the Lord, absent from the body and to be present

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.100
with the Lord.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:51.180
For to live as Christ, to die as gain, I'm going to be with Christ forevermore.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:59.500
This morning, if you relate best in Acts 16 to the Philippian jailer and you're not saved,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:06.220
this morning, recognize that you're a sinner in need of a Savior.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.780
Recognize that Jesus is the only Savior, for all have sinned and come short of the glory

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.780
of God.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.220
As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.420
Recognize that you need to be saved.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.300
Recognize that Jesus is the only Savior.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.460
You can't work your way to heaven.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.660
You can't be part of a church to get to heaven.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.420
You can't give money to get to heaven.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.540
You can't do good things to get to heaven.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:36.460
It's kind of like using the wrong currency at the grocery store.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.820
They say that's not accepted here.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:47.380
The only form of payment, if I can use that term this morning, to atone for your sin and

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:52.980
for my sin and the sin of the world, is what we sang about to start our service this morning,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.940
the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.820
It's the blood.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.900
It's the blood.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.020
And Jesus did that for you because He loved you.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:07.460
And this morning, I would say this, receive Him as your Savior, for whosoever shall call

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.980
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:16.060
In 2 Corinthians 6 and verse number 2, the Bible says, now is the accepted time, behold,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.540
now is the day of salvation.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:25.060
Oh, this morning, if you're not saved, would you trust Christ as your Savior?

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.820
Before it's eternally too late, trust Christ.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.820
We don't know when we're going to die, but we do know that we have an appointment with

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.060
death.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:39.980
The Bible says, and as it is appointed unto man, once to die, after this the judgment.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.100
And so this morning, if you're not saved, it's our prayer that you trust Christ as your

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.380
Savior today.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:51.380
This morning, if you're saved, I hope that you would rejoice in your salvation.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.340
And I hope this morning that we would make a commitment to the Lord that we'd be like

00:47:55.340 --> 00:48:02.340
Paul, and we would not allow for our gospel to be hid, but that we would proclaim the

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340
truth.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.140
Listen, it's a wonderful thing if someone comes and asks you, what must I do to be saved?

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.060
Oh, we better be ready to give an answer, amen?

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.260
And we live our lives in such a way that people would come and ask us, hey, you have

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.660
something that I don't have.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.660
How can I have that?

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.180
I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.180
Let's pray together.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.260
Father, we love you.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.500
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.180
We thank you for the precious truth of your Word.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.300
I thank you for this gospel account in Acts 16, and Lord, as we think of this record that

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.820
you've provided us with, I thank you for this jailer that got saved.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:45.060
We trust in Christ as his Savior, and Lord, I pray that you would move and work in our

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060
midst this morning.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.260
God, would you have your will and way.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.980
If there's one here that's not saved, Lord, I pray that they would trust Christ as their

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:52.980
Savior.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.020
Lord, for everyone that's been born again, they've been saved by the blood of Christ.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:01.740
I pray that you'd help us, Lord, to be faithful to proclaim the message.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.940
In this moment of invitation, I pray that you'd have your will and way, that decisions

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.340
would be made that would please me, and we'll thank you for it.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.580
In Christ's name we pray.
