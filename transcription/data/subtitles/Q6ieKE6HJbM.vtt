00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.199
Psalm 81 this evening, Psalm 81 and verse number 7, I'm going to take this verse right

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.500
out of this psalm and then we're going to go back to the historical account as it's

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.319
recorded for us in the book of Exodus that is being referenced here in Psalm 81 and verse

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:22.659
number 7.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.760
You understand if you've been with us over the last couple of weeks that we've discussed

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.580
the power of prayer and the ability of our God to help and what a blessing it is to know

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.759
that our God answers prayer.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:39.159
We preached that message last Sunday morning from Daniel 2, had the opportunity to look

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:47.479
on Friday evening at that truth in 2 Chronicles 7 and verse number 14 and before God gave

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.439
Solomon that promise and we find that he mentioned, I have heard thy prayer.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:59.319
We've looked at a number of passages of scriptures, we've dealt with the Bible studies each evening

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:06.239
and looked at these passages of scripture with regard to the ability of our God to help.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm thankful that there is nothing too hard for God.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.559
What a blessing to know that there's absolutely nothing that's too hard for our God.

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:22.279
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty and I'm so thankful that nothing is impossible with

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:23.279
Him.

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:29.519
We know that He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think and that's

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.319
a prayer promise that we find in Ephesians 3 and verse number 20.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:39.160
As we look at this particular passage of scripture, we are once again reminded of the power of

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.440
God and that there is absolutely no situation that is outside of His control.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.080
Sometimes we go through life and we go through this journey of life and we think that there

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.120
are some things that have happened and we can't fully comprehend them, we can't understand

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.040
them and we feel like we've been led right into a hardship.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.720
Maybe we even feel like, man, we prayed about this and we sought the direction from the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.839
Lord with regard to this and yet we find ourselves in this difficult position.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:08.039
Why?

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.559
What happened?

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.699
God's in control.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.399
It's not outside of His control.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.960
It's not something that has surprised God.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.360
I know that a theologian of yesteryear said, did it ever occur to you that nothing's ever

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.080
occurred to God?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.759
And He is the Lord God Almighty.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.080
He's also omniscient.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.000
He's Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.399
He is the Almighty God.

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.160
He is eternal and immutable and for that we rejoice.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.839
In Psalm 81, the verse of scripture that we're going to look at this evening is verse number

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:44.039
7 and we find that this reference in this psalm refers to really the first trial that

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:49.039
was endured by the children of Israel after they crossed the Red Sea.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.759
We'll look back at Exodus 15 in just a moment, but I want you to consider with me how the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.440
psalmist says this truth in verse number 7.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.039
Notice, thou callest in trouble and I delivered thee.

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.199
I answered thee in the secret place of thunder.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:13.800
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah, Sila.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:19.160
And we find that as we would look to this truth that is taking place here and we would

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.119
understand all that's happening and we are mindful of these trials and these difficulties

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:31.000
in which the children of Israel would face, we find that there were two occasions in which

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.080
the Lord was giving His direction to His people and we find that as God would help the people

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.360
of Israel understand that He was leading them, that He was the one that was providing

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.639
the direction for them.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.919
I spoke a moment ago and said it was the first trial they endured and I apologize for that.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.800
It was not the first trial.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.520
It was shortly thereafter.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.479
We find that the first trial was similar to this trial that is referenced in Psalm 81.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:07.520
The first trial that they endured after they crossed over the Red Sea, we find that that's

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.639
recorded in Exodus 14 and Exodus 15.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.100
We read of the song of Moses and how they're praising God and all that's taking place.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.959
And then after just three days, they come to this place where they found no water and

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.920
the waters were bitter.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.640
That place was called Marah and we read of that in Exodus chapter number 15.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.279
All throughout chapter number 16, we read about the truth with regard to the manna that

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:39.040
God provided and how God blessed and just the pattern in which they had to follow for

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.799
collecting and all of that.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:44.279
And then we come to Exodus chapter number 17.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.679
And really it's the reference from which we find they're in Psalm 81 in verse number 7.

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:52.880
If you're taking notes this evening, I'd like to simply entitle the message,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.799
Thou called and I delivered.

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:58.239
Thou called and I delivered.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:04.519
I mean, just thinking about the first part of Psalm 81 in verse number 7 brings such

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:08.920
comfort and peace to the heart of God's people.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.160
He said, Thou callest in trouble and I delivered thee.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.519
He says, I answered thee in the secret place of thunder.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:24.000
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah, Sila.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.920
As we think about the passage of scripture there in Exodus 15, that first problem that

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.480
they endured, the first hardship that they endured with the water at Marah being bitter

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.679
water, we find that God provided a solution to their problem and God blessed them.

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:46.440
Not only did he bless them after and gave them water there, but then the Bible tells

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.359
us that he led them in the place in which he led them.

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:59.000
According to Exodus 15 in verse number 27 was a place called Elam where there were twelve

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
wells of water.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.040
What a blessing to see how the Lord provided.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.880
But then we come to chapter 17 and notice the beginning of the text of scripture.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.239
The Bible says, And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:16.440
wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the Lord and pitched

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.720
in Rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.760
The Bible says, Wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said, Give us water that we

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760
may drink.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.040
And Moses said unto them, Why chide you with me?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040
Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.239
And the people thirsted there for water.

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:38.100
And the people murmured against Moses and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.920
us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.880
And Moses cried unto the Lord saying, What shall I do unto this people?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.760
They be almost ready to stone me.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.839
And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people and take with thee of the elders

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.320
of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.880
Take in thine hand and go.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.399
Verse 6, Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock and horb and thou shalt

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.980
smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.579
And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel and he called the name of the place

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:18.140
Masa and Meribah because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.779
the Lord saying, Is the Lord among us or not?

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:29.140
It's interesting as we find ourselves studying these themes and these thoughts with regard

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.059
to the ability of our God and the power of our God.

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:38.239
We find that the Bible is filled with examples of God working miraculously and how God would

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:44.019
prove his people and how he is, as we've mentioned often, and I've shared the verses

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:49.100
with you via email, I will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence cometh my help.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.140
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:59.339
On Thursday evening, we studied Psalm 46, that God is our refuge, our strength and a

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.459
very present help in the time of trouble.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.420
And what a joy to understand the power of our God.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.339
Thou called and I delivered.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:14.579
I wonder what would happen if they did not call unto God, if we did not seek the face

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:18.619
of God, if we did not understand the power of our God.

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:23.420
See, when we understand who he is and we face a time of difficulty, thou callest in the

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.880
time of trouble, I understand that I can go to God knowing that he is able to do something

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.700
about the situation.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.260
We find that there's a problem that is recorded here in our passage of Scripture here in

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.739
Exodus 17, and the problem is that there is no water.

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:45.580
Now, consider with me that first reference that I mentioned in Exodus chapter number

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.780
15, where there was bitter water.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.979
There was a problem there at that passage of Scripture as well at Marah, where they

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:57.380
found water, but the water was not drinkable.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.340
It was bitter water.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.299
And we find that it caused a problem, but we see through that process that God healed

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:10.539
those waters and God proved them, and really, the account that we find in Exodus 15 should

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:15.219
have been a faith builder for the children of Israel.

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:16.219
Why?

00:09:16.219 --> 00:09:19.140
They got to witness God work firsthand.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:25.020
Not only should that have increased their faith and been a faith builder in their lives,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.700
but all of the content of Exodus chapter number 16 with regard to the manna that God provided,

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:36.059
oh, how that should have built the faith of the children of Israel.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:40.900
But you find that when they encounter the problem as it's reported to us in Exodus 17,

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.219
they immediately respond by chiding with Moses.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:51.700
They face this problem, and they do not immediately respond with prayer and with seeking the face

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.619
of God and with saying one to another, we've seen God work before.

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:58.460
I wonder what God's going to do in this situation.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.940
I wonder how God would provide.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.700
No, they went back to their natural tendencies

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.420
to simply murmur and complain.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.980
And really, if we look at the nation of Israel

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.900
and we study the children of Israel,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.660
it is very easy for us to attack them and criticize them,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.700
but oh how often we do the same things that they do.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.580
We face a problem, we face a difficulty,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.020
and we've seen God work over the years

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.740
and we've seen God provide,

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.580
but we come to this challenge

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.900
and all of those events that were designed

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.380
to increase our faith, to build our faith,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.060
we've kind of just forgotten about them

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.860
because this problem is different.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.660
We find that God had led them,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.980
you notice the Bible says,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.100
and all the congregation of the children of Israel

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.460
in verse number one,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.100
journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.720
according to the commandment of what?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.760
The Lord, and pitched in Rephidim.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.800
The very reason that they were in Rephidim

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.360
is because God led them there.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.400
Let that sink in for just a moment.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.440
Sometimes it's not that we missed the will of the Lord,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.120
it's not that I should have prayed more about this,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.560
sometimes God will lead us directly

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.680
into a place of difficulty so that He can prove Himself,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.040
so that He can develop us, so that He can be glorified.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.120
And we find that God led them directly to Rephidim

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.840
and it was in that place where there was no water

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.980
for the people to drink.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.319
There's a problem in Rephidim.

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:34.000
I think about this problem

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.040
and I find that it's very interesting

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.819
as we would look at the similarities

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:40.080
between the problem in Exodus 15

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.400
and the problem as it's recorded here in Exodus 17,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.080
and there are plenty of similarities,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.120
but there is a distinct contrast.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.819
In Marah, there was water,

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:53.860
it just was bitter and not drinkable.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.220
Here in Rephidim, there's no water.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.100
And so there's a problem with how we're going

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.740
to quench our thirst, how we're going to survive.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.100
We need water.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.139
There is that problem,

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:10.860
but we find that in chapter number 15,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.139
that the solution that is given

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:17.300
is that God shows Moses a tree.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.979
And if you flip back there and you look in verse number 25,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.419
the Bible says the Lord showed him a tree

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:23.380
which when he had cast into the waters,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.760
the waters were made sweet.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.220
You can disagree with me and we can talk later

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.500
and that would be fine,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.740
but I have a tendency to believe

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.260
as I study the behavior of the children of Israel

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.619
to see their murmuring and complaining,

00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:40.979
to see how they respond to difficulties

00:12:40.979 --> 00:12:43.699
that had they come to Rephidim

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:45.540
and there was bitter water,

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.600
I don't really believe they would have sought the Lord.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.779
I believe what they would have done

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:51.979
is they would have sought a tree.

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.460
They would have tried to find a tree

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.300
to cast into that water

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.500
because that's what happened at Marah.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.460
And if that was the solution at Marah,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.979
then that could be the solution at Rephidim.

00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:03.260
And so what does God do?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.020
He takes them to a place where there's no water,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.460
not to a place where there's bitter water,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.059
but to a place where there's no water.

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:12.900
He's developing them.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.139
I don't necessarily desire to be in a place

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:16.760
where there's no water,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.580
but it's interesting to see as we study the history

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.979
and we see what's going on

00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:24.619
and we see there's a real problem.

00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:28.260
The problem is followed by a prayer.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.940
Yes, we see the contention,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.820
the chiding with the people with Moses

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.860
and that which takes place in verses two and three.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.740
And we find the way in which they respond

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.660
to their hardship and they say,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.979
at the end of verse number three,

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.180
wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.260
out of Egypt to kill us and our children

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.860
and our cattle with thirst?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.699
Notice the prayer in verse number four,

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:53.100
in Moses cried unto the Lord.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.639
It's interesting to look at the response of the people

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:02.419
and contrast it with the response of Moses.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.900
The response of the people,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.240
chiding with Moses, murmuring and complaining.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.380
The response of the people, we're all gonna die.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.619
The response of Moses, he calls out to the Lord.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.500
He cries unto the Lord.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.420
You know, in my own life,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.820
I find that oftentimes when we face hardships

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.779
and difficulties, it's easy to respond

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.760
like the children of Israel.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.899
To murmur, to complain,

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:36.660
to look at it perhaps from a pessimistic point of view

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.540
and say it's all just gonna be terrible.

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:42.220
It's possible for us to respond that way.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.220
In fact, there's oftentimes in our lives,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.980
if we'd be honest, that we respond more

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.580
like the children of Israel than we do like Moses.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.619
But Moses' response to the problem

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:57.100
and to the chiding and to that which is taking place

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.260
is that he cries unto the Lord.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.739
He sought the face of God.

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:05.019
See, Moses was the one that you'll remember

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:06.619
at the beginning of his call,

00:15:06.619 --> 00:15:09.339
if you would go back to the beginning of Exodus

00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:11.260
and consider where Moses is found

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.459
and how God appeared to him.

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:13.619
Remember that burning bush

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:15.380
and all that God showed him

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.779
and how God proved to him.

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:19.820
And then he was the one that saw God

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.580
work mightily through the plagues.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.140
He was the one that stood there

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.820
at the brink of the Red Sea

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.059
and lifted up that rod and God parted the sea.

00:15:29.059 --> 00:15:33.220
He had witnessed God work in amazing ways.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.580
He'd experienced the power of God.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.980
I mean, so did the other people,

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.299
but Moses understood the power of God

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.899
and he cries out unto the Lord.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.580
Oh, that our immediate response

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.420
would be one of seeking the face of God.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.860
In our current situation,

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.899
pandemic in the globe,

00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:57.700
all that's going on,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.899
and all of the restrictions and regulations

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:00.860
that have been in place,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.980
it's easy for us to murmur and complain.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.420
It's easy for us to just act like

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.179
the children of Israel,

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:11.059
but oh, that we'd seek the face of God

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.580
and respond like Moses did.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.260
See, the title of the message this evening

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.420
that we adopted there from Psalm 81

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.339
in verse number seven,

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:23.700
thou called and I delivered.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.100
I'm thankful that Moses cried out to the Lord.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.820
The Bible tells us that he says,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.899
what shall I do unto this people?

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:34.459
You see that he is at a place

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:35.820
in which he has no solution.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.940
He doesn't know what to do.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.420
He's seeking the face of God.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.739
He says, God, I need answers.

00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:41.380
I need to know what to do.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.059
He says this, they'd be almost ready to stone me.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.980
Now, often the children of Israel respond

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.619
to the leader, to Moses,

00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:53.739
by chiding with him, murmuring, complaining,

00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:54.779
and ready to kill him.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:56.299
And I've often asked the question,

00:16:56.299 --> 00:16:58.420
what is that going to solve?

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.179
I mean, if they stone Moses here

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:02.339
in Exodus 17 in verse number four,

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:04.860
they still are in a place where there's no water.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.420
It does not change their circumstance.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.899
In fact, it just makes matters worse

00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:12.140
because he was the one that was beseeching the Lord.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.580
He was the one that was seeking God

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.019
on their behalf for a solution.

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:20.739
And we find here that Moses cries out to the Lord,

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:24.260
thou callest in the time of trouble and I delivered.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.779
And what a joy to know that our God hears

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.019
and answers prayer.

00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:30.619
And we find here that the Lord said unto Moses,

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:32.860
notice that in verse number four,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.940
and Moses cried unto the Lord,

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.980
in verse number five,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.980
and the Lord said unto Moses,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.940
Moses goes to God in prayer.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.779
We find that he prays specifically about the situation.

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:46.899
And as he prays specifically about the situation,

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:50.220
he receives a specific response.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.899
We find that there's a problem.

00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:53.299
We find there's a prayer.

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:55.100
We find the provision.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.580
Notice in verse number five,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.260
the Lord said unto Moses,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.660
go on before the people

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.179
and take with thee of the elders of Israel

00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:07.220
and thy rod,

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.619
wherewith thou smotest the river,

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:12.820
take in thine hand and go.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.380
Now you just pause at the instruction of verse number five

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.860
and you find that Moses has received this instruction

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.779
that he's gonna go before the people.

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:24.820
He's gonna take with him the elders of Israel

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.420
and his rod,

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.980
that rod that he had in his hand.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.500
Remember at the very beginning of the call of Moses,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.940
what is that in thine hand?

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.979
Right, he had a rod.

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:36.780
And remember God told him to throw it on the ground

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.140
and what happened, the thing became a serpent.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.419
And then he said to pick it up and it returned to a rod.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:43.859
We find that that rod,

00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:46.940
you find as you go through the passage of Scripture

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.979
throughout the book of Exodus,

00:18:47.979 --> 00:18:50.940
you see how that he has that rod with him

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.419
and he tells him to go before the people.

00:18:55.419 --> 00:18:57.299
And then he tells him in verse number six this,

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:00.539
Behold, I will stand before thee there

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.299
upon the rock in Horeb.

00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:09.020
So he's gonna tell them a specific place to go to.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.099
We find that there's going to be provision.

00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:16.539
See, the Bible says thou shalt smite the rock

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:21.220
and there shall come water out of it

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.820
that the people may drink.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.059
Now, he then says and Moses did so

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.780
in the sight of the elders of Israel.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.419
Moses obeyed God.

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.140
Isn't that great faith?

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.659
I've never smitten a rock and water came out of it.

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.820
It was not a common thing for us to do, right?

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.500
And we find that here, God gives this specific answer.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.700
He's answering the prayer of his servant

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.539
and he's providing the provision for his people.

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:50.220
We find, we understand this evening that God made us.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.260
He created us.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.419
He knows our form.

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:53.859
He knows what we're made of.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:58.059
He knows that water is a basic necessity of survival.

00:19:58.059 --> 00:19:59.179
God knows that.

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:04.339
And God is able to provide in a miraculous way, in a supernatural way.

00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:08.859
We find here that the Bible tells us that Moses is given the instruction that as he

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:14.499
goes before the people and he takes these elders of Israel with him with his rod, that

00:20:14.499 --> 00:20:20.899
God would show him the place to go and that he should smite the rock and there shall come

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:24.459
water out of it that the people may drink.

00:20:24.459 --> 00:20:28.219
Now it's interesting to me that the Bible says that Moses did so in the sight of the

00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:30.059
elders of Israel.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.699
Moses just had great faith in God.

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:34.659
He just believed God.

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:38.399
I mean, he didn't go and tell people, well, I'm going to go over here secretly and see

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:39.619
if this thing works.

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:44.419
No, no, he went right like God told him to go and the people were there and he took those

00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:48.519
elders and the Bible says that he did what God told him to do.

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:53.739
He smote that rock and the Bible tells us that they were, the people that were there,

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:55.459
they were able to drink.

00:20:55.459 --> 00:20:58.739
God provided his provision.

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:03.379
See, God is able to provide in unique ways.

00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:06.939
God is able to care for us as his children.

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:12.499
We dealt with, as we've studied in recent days, the passage of Scripture in that familiar

00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:17.519
Psalm, Psalm 23, and we dealt with the fact that the Lord is my shepherd and as we spoke

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:24.659
of that passage of Scripture, we dealt with the truth that as the shepherd provides for

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:30.779
the sheep and protects in his presence and we spoke about God's provision for us as his

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:36.059
people and I'm thankful this evening that Moses obeyed the Lord.

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:39.499
You know, there's a principle that's contained there.

00:21:39.499 --> 00:21:45.619
Maybe as we look at this passage of Scripture and we see the way in which Moses responded

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:49.859
in obedience that that is what resulted in the blessing.

00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:51.959
That's a principle of God's Word.

00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:55.839
We find that it's established throughout the whole of Scripture that as we, as God's

00:21:55.839 --> 00:22:03.359
people, obey God's instruction that God provides and he blesses as only he can.

00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:12.039
See, there was nothing within Moses to cause this water to flow out of the rock.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:18.119
There was no ability within Moses to care for the children of Israel in his own power,

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:20.059
in his own might.

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:22.579
There was nothing within Moses.

00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:24.099
Remember he's at the end of himself.

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:27.419
He says in verse number four, what shall I do unto this people?

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:30.500
They be almost ready to stone me.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.579
Can I tell you this evening that we need to learn some valuable lessons from Exodus chapter

00:22:36.579 --> 00:22:38.699
number 17.

00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:43.219
Some of the valuable lessons that we learn from this passage of Scripture is I believe

00:22:43.219 --> 00:22:48.419
as we look here at these few verses that we first need to remember the blessings of God

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:54.379
and how those blessings will build our faith for the trials that we will face.

00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:57.779
See there's some things in your life, there's some things in my life where I've seen God

00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:05.419
work and I've seen God do and bless and provide and those things are faith builders.

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:10.299
And as we remember those things and perhaps even as we would look at certain portions

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:15.859
of Scripture and deal with the memorials that God deals with and how even Joshua there in

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:20.299
the land after they crossed the Jordan they were to set up those memorials and how those

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:24.739
things help us to remember what God has done.

00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:29.299
See I can't help but think about the children of Israel in Exodus 15 and then they come

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:33.299
to Exodus 17 and they had so soon forgotten.

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:37.059
Unless we think that we should just criticize the children of Israel and say it wouldn't

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:41.819
happen to me, I want to remind you of the disciples in the New Testament and remind

00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:46.099
you about the time in which there was the feeding of the 5,000.

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:49.819
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture and we're familiar with the way in which God

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:53.219
blessed and multiplied and there was just a little lunch.

00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:58.859
Remember the disciples had the idea, hey the day is far spent, send them away, I mean we

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:03.159
have nothing for them and Jesus says give them something to eat and they kind of look

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:08.500
at each other like we don't have the resources, we don't have the ability to do this.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500
What did God do?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.379
He blessed and multiplied and we find that it was Andrew that said 200 penny worth is

00:24:14.379 --> 00:24:16.579
not sufficient that everyone might have a little.

00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:20.899
The Bible tells us that they all ate, 5,000 men besides women and children, they were

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:24.139
set in companies and God provided for them.

00:24:24.139 --> 00:24:29.419
The disciples would go to the Lord Jesus Christ and take and distribute that bread and that

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:34.759
fish and the Bible says they were all filled and they took up 12 basketfuls.

00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:38.259
Then there's the feeding of the 4,000, another miracle of God.

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:41.820
The New Testament we read about the feeding of the 5,000, we also read about the feeding

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.820
of the 4,000.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:48.459
It was shortly after these miracles that the Lord Jesus Christ gives a warning to the disciples

00:24:48.459 --> 00:24:52.539
about beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.

00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:57.539
It's hypocrisy, that's what the leaven of the Pharisees is, but you find that what do

00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:58.579
they begin to do?

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:03.579
Right after Jesus says beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, we forgot to bring bread.

00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:04.579
That's how they respond.

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:06.739
And what does Jesus say?

00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:08.559
Did you forget?

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:12.059
Did you forget about the 5,000 and how I fed?

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:15.660
Did you forget about the 4,000 and how I fed?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:25.139
And see, in our lives, we often as human beings are faced with difficulties and circumstances

00:25:25.139 --> 00:25:34.820
and in the moment, they're so big and they're so problematic that sometimes it absolutely

00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:40.220
consumes us to the point that we forget what God has done.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.859
Not that we forget it in the sense that if someone reminds us that we say, I never heard

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:48.699
that before, but in the sense that we're so consumed with this, what is right in front

00:25:48.699 --> 00:25:56.539
of me, that I fail to take into consideration in that moment what my God has done and how

00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:59.699
He has provided and how He has blessed.

00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:07.380
I know that there was just someone that would say, listen, God has worked, He's provided

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.859
the manna that we ate today, He provided water back at Marah, He took us to Elam where there

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:17.100
were 12 springs of water, I mean, He's able, let's seek the face of God.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.979
No, murmur, complain, we're all going to die.

00:26:21.979 --> 00:26:26.399
We need to be mindful of remembering what God has done.

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:28.979
We need to be mindful to go to God in prayer.

00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:33.619
Oh, that we would immediately go to God.

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:38.059
Thou called, and I delivered.

00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:44.660
I wonder how often we don't receive the help that God would love to offer us simply because

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.660
we don't ask.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.899
I think about it in our own lives, I mean, physically speaking, you go throughout mundane

00:26:50.899 --> 00:26:53.579
tasks and you try to do things occasionally.

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:58.419
We've kind of joked in the house, I mean, when I married Holly, I realized, man, she's

00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:04.059
so tall for a lady in her height, and now she's like the shortest in our family, and

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:06.539
it's kind of comical in our home.

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:11.500
But there are times in which Holly will be reaching for something high in the cabinet,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.220
and it's like, hey, if you just ask one of these kids that are taller than you, they

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.139
can reach higher.

00:27:17.139 --> 00:27:22.100
And sometimes you'll struggle to reach something, you'll struggle to get that thing, and all

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.899
you had to do was ask for help.

00:27:23.899 --> 00:27:28.459
I know I've shared with you, when I went to BIMI a couple of years ago, and I was standing

00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:34.179
in the ticket line in order to process my bags so that I could take my flight down to

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:39.139
the conference that I was attending, and as we were going through those areas and dealing

00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:43.339
with those machines, this lady came and she offered help to the gentleman that was to

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:46.139
my left, and he said, I'm good, I don't need it.

00:27:46.139 --> 00:27:50.419
And then she offered help to me, and I'm like, listen, I've not used this machine before,

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:53.699
if you want to help me, you work here, man, that works for me.

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:58.660
And bam, bam, bam, she hit a few things, and we were on our way, and that guy is like,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.660
this thing's not working.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.179
He's like, can you help me?

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:03.179
It was comical.

00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:07.019
She says, I offered, and you said you were okay.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:10.259
And then she went over and helped him.

00:28:10.259 --> 00:28:13.660
But the reality is that there are times in our lives, physically speaking, I mean, on

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:19.299
this terrestrial earth that we just miss out on somebody's help because we don't ask.

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:22.380
I think about it from a spiritual perspective.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.220
Our God is of very present help at the time of trouble.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.579
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence cometh my help.

00:28:29.579 --> 00:28:32.719
We find that the psalmist called unto God, and He delivered.

00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:37.260
We find here, as the psalmist would mention about this historical account, Moses prayed

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.580
to God, and God answered, and God delivered.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:48.299
And how often in our own lives do we face troubles, do we face times of difficulty where

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:53.899
God is seeking to develop us, where God is seeking to be glorified, and we just continue

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:57.859
to struggle with this thing because we're wrestling with it in our own flesh, in our

00:28:57.859 --> 00:28:59.339
own power.

00:28:59.339 --> 00:29:06.039
And we're trying to scheme and devise and figure out and analyze instead of just going

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.979
to God in prayer.

00:29:08.979 --> 00:29:14.099
See the people, they complained and murmured, they chided with Moses, but Moses prayed.

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:15.940
He cried out unto the Lord.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:22.419
I believe that we need to recognize that our God is able to do anything, anything.

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:24.339
There's no water.

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:27.039
God knows they need water.

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:33.099
God knew they needed water before they ever complained about no water.

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:39.099
In fact, God knew when He led them to Rephidim that there was no water there.

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:40.099
God knew that.

00:29:40.099 --> 00:29:42.779
It didn't surprise God.

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:46.619
God knew, but God led them there anyway.

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:48.020
Why?

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.359
Because God was going to prove them.

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:55.859
God was going to seek to build their faith.

00:29:55.859 --> 00:29:57.619
God would be glorified.

00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:59.219
And I believe for us this evening.

00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:06.619
the passage of Scripture is preserved for us, not just so that we could have a

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:12.339
record of history that the children of Israel were in Rephidim, but so that we

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:18.619
could see how God provided and what God is able to do. And so this evening the

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:24.019
psalmist said as he recollected from this portion of Scripture that God says

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:31.219
thou callest in a time of trouble and I delivered. Oh that we just

00:30:31.219 --> 00:30:36.459
call unto the Lord, seek his face in prayer, and see what he is able to do.

00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:41.459
Father we love you this evening, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for the

00:30:41.459 --> 00:30:47.019
privilege of being able to serve you, we thank you that you've given us the

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:55.179
record of thy Word, history that is contained therein, that is used to

00:30:55.179 --> 00:31:03.059
encourage us and strengthen us. And Lord I pray this evening that you would help

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:09.299
us to be strengthened and encouraged by this passage of Scripture, that God we

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:19.579
would understand thou called and I delivered. Oh that we would not murmur

00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:26.459
and complain as the children of Israel did. God that we'd seek your face and see

00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:30.379
what you're able to do. We know that you are the Lord God Almighty and that

00:31:30.379 --> 00:31:34.059
there is nothing too hard for thee. We know that you can do exceeding

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:38.939
abundantly above all that we ask or think. God I pray that you would prove

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:44.699
yourself, that you would help us Lord to exercise faith and that you alone would

00:31:44.699 --> 00:31:49.419
be glorified. Have your will and way in our lives, help us to spend time this

00:31:49.419 --> 00:31:56.259
evening. Those that are watching via live stream to reflect and consider to seek

00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:00.379
the face of God, those of us that are gathered here Lord that we'd allow you

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:04.619
to have your will and way in our lives. We'll thank you for it in Christ's name

00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:08.379
we pray, amen.

00:32:08.939 --> 00:32:10.999
you
