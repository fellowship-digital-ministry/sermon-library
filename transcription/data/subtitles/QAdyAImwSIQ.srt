1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
All right, this is our midweek service and first Wednesday evening of January.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,200
We're actually pre recording the message here on Tuesday morning, and I'll be sending out

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,760
an email with some information as to why we did things this way.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,920
But of course, if you'd continue to pray for our family with the fact that we're exposed

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,920
to someone who tested positive with COVID, and we just trust that God would keep us safe

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,000
and certainly miss you.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,740
And we're praying for you looking forward to seeing you soon.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,840
And again, I'll be sending out an email, but we're going to start our service by singing

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
channels only one of my favorite hymns.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,759
It's number 477, our hymnal and Joseph's going to help us lead in songs again, number 477

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Channels only, blessed master, God with all thy wondrous power

12
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Every day and every hour

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,759
Witnessing thy power to save me

15
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,759
Seeking free from self and sin

16
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,759
Thou who brought this to possess me

17
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,759
In thy fullness, Lord, come in

18
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,759
Channels only, blessed master

19
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,759
God with all thy wondrous power

20
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,759
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

21
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,759
Every day and every hour

22
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,759
Jesus, fill now with thy spirit

23
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,759
Hearts that will surrender, know

24
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,759
That the streams of living water

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,759
From our inner man may flow

26
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,759
Channels only, blessed master

27
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,759
God with all thy wondrous power

28
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,759
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

29
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,759
Every day and every hour

30
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,759
Well, amen, I appreciate Joseph's willingness to help out and lead songs

31
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:28,759
and certainly appreciate that and I want to encourage you

32
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,759
that we serve a great God and that he would use us

33
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,759
Isn't that amazing? Channels only

34
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,759
and to think about the fact that God would use us

35
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,759
and that he would fill us and he would enable us

36
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,759
and then he would use us for his honor and for his glory

37
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,759
and it is my desire that God would use me

38
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,759
and I trust that you have that same desire

39
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
We certainly thank the Lord for the opportunities of technology

40
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,759
and thankful for our team that has worked so tirelessly

41
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,759
over the last year, really more than that

42
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,759
but especially over this last year

43
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,759
in order to get all of these audiovisual things up to speed

44
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,759
so that we can do all of these things that we need to do

45
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,759
and very much appreciate their service in that capacity

46
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,759
Let's go to the Lord in prayer

47
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,759
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us

48
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,760
We thank you for the blessings in which you have bestowed upon us

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
We thank you for your grace and your mercy

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
We thank you, God, for the word of God

51
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,760
We pray that you would just speak to our hearts as we open the scriptures

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I pray that you would help us to be challenged and encouraged and comforted

53
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I pray, God, that you would help us to make decisions that would please thee

54
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I pray, Father, that you would help each one to be attentive and responsive

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
I pray that we'd be helped through thy word

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
We do think of those that are continuing to struggle with some health needs

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Lord, we pray that you'd meet each need

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
that you'd be gracious and merciful

59
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
We thank you that you're the great physician

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
We thank you that you've given us the instruction

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
that if any are sick, that we're to pray

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,760
and God, we ask that you'd work in a distinct way as only you could

63
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
We pray that you would be glorified

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
We thank you and praise you for all that you'll do

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen

66
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I do want to encourage you to continue to pray

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,760
for Virginia and Yolanda and the Petersons

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,760
and then also if you would pray for the Ronnie

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
with his back and for his mom also, Miss Anne Hall

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,760
and we are certainly thankful for the way in which God has answered prayer

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
and shown himself faithful

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
and we serve a great God

73
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I hope that you have been encouraged these last few days

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,760
as you have considered the new theme for this year

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Complete in Christ

76
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
and what a blessing

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,760
and so excited about the prospect of going through the book of Colossians

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
and studying through that book verse by verse this calendar year

79
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
in our morning services on Sunday

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
and trust that you will be encouraged and strengthened

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,760
We do have daily devotionals and church calendars

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
and also sermon notebooks

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,760
with some instructions on how you'll be able to get those

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,760
and we've worked out a plan so that we can get those distributed

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
and I certainly apologize for the delay on being able to get those things distributed

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
but with this exposure to COVID we have to be extremely cautious

87
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,760
and I want to make sure that we're doing all that we're supposed to do

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,760
It is exciting as you pull up the driveway at church

89
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
to see the construction of the parsonage

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
and I want you to continue to pray

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
if you will for that project that things would continue to move forward

92
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
but it certainly is exciting to see a structure coming there

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,760
and looking forward to soon seeing that project completed

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
and being able to take occupancy

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
and your prayers are greatly appreciated

96
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,760
and I want to also remind you

97
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,760
to pray for the Savali family I mentioned on Sunday

98
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,760
about their situation there with the new church plant

99
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
and so if you would continue to pray for wisdom and direction

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,760
that God would just guide them and direct them

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,760
and it's exciting to see the hand of the Lord at work in that situation

102
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,760
and they've kind of, as Brother Savali has termed it

103
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
it's a fluid situation

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,760
and they have received yes and then no and then yes again

105
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
but we know that God is working

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,760
and we know that the cause of Christ is moving forward

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
the people of God are being encouraged

108
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
and so please do continue to pray

109
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
and we look forward to being able to provide you with more updates

110
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
as we receive those from Brother Savali

111
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
at this time we'll have our offering

112
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
and so I'll pray for the offering

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
thank you again for your faithfulness in giving

114
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
not only for the ministry here

115
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
as we seek to reach our community

116
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,760
but also in the supporting of missionaries around the globe

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
so that we could see the gospel move forward

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Father we thank you for the privilege of giving

119
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
we acknowledge that all that we have is because of your grace

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,760
and because of your good hand of blessing that's been upon us

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
God we thank you for the opportunity

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
what a privilege it is to be able to give back to you

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,760
to participate in the work of God through our finances

124
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I pray that you take and bless the offering

125
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,760
use it for the furtherance of the ministry here and around the globe

126
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
and we'll thank you for it

127
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760

163
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
And certainly a blessing to me.

164
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
And I trust the service will be a blessing to you as well.

165
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,760
And we're very thankful for the opportunity of being able to continue in our series from Wednesday evening.

166
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
As we wrapped up last year, we were still dealing with the subject matter of sound doctrine.

167
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:50,760
And as we're looking at sound doctrine and dealing with all of those particular subjects that we've been dealing with.

168
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,760
We have had the opportunity to look at the doctrine of Christ.

169
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,760
And we have been looking here for a number of weeks now at the doctrine of Christ.

170
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:09,760
And the particular subject in which we're dealing with, this will be part three of a sermon series titled,

171
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Jesus is all the world to me.

172
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,760
And we started that back on December the 9th.

173
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760

174
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,760
And today we will finish up this three-part series as to Jesus is all the world to me.

175
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,760
And I kind of asked this question, if you were to say Jesus is all the world to you.

176
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
And someone said, why? Why is Jesus all the world to you?

177
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
What would you say? How would you respond to that question?

178
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,760
The reality is that we started looking at the doctrine of Christ in that great passage of Scripture in Matthew 16.

179
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,760
When Jesus asked the question to the disciples, he said, whom do men say that I am?

180
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,760
And we understand that when Jesus asked that question, that the response of the disciples reveals to us

181
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
that there was a great amount of confusion amongst the people.

182
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Why? Because they responded and said, well, some say that you're John the Baptist, Isaiah, Jeremiah, one of the prophets.

183
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,760
And then Jesus looks to his disciples and he says, but whom do ye say that I am?

184
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:27,760
And Peter stands and what a great declaration when he said, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

185
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,760
And it's important that we understand who Jesus is, that he is God in flesh.

186
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
We understand that he is Messiah, the promised one, the anointed one.

187
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,760
We understand that he came with a purpose to live a perfect and sinless life,

188
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,760
to go to the cross of Calvary, to shed his precious blood,

189
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,760
to be buried in a borrowed tomb, to rise conquering sin, death, and the grave,

190
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,760
to be ascended to heaven where he lives even now, ever interceding for us.

191
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,760
And one day, one glorious day, he will come and receive us unto himself.

192
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
And what a joy it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ.

193
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
What a joy it is that we have this book, the Bible.

194
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
And the songwriter said, Jesus is all the world to me.

195
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
And I think about what Peter said.

196
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Peter proclaimed there in Matthew 16, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

197
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,760
But then it was Peter that God used in the book of 1 Peter.

198
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
And I'd invite you to turn in your Bibles to 1 Peter, chapter number 2.

199
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
And I want you to notice what Peter says.

200
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,760
We use this portion of Scripture in our last study as well.

201
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,760
But it's so important for us to understand and to see how God would use Peter

202
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,760
and the way in which he would communicate this great truth to us.

203
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,760
The Bible says in verse number 3 of 1 Peter, chapter number 2,

204
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,760
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

205
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

206
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm so thankful that our God is gracious.

207
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,760
And then if you skip down to verse number 7, the Bible says this,

208
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:08,760
unto you therefore which believe, He is precious.

209
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
If you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

210
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,760
if you have believed and you've received Him as your Savior,

211
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I believe this day that you would say, He is precious.

212
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,760
And we would say as the songwriter wrote that great hymn, Jesus is all the world to me.

213
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Why?

214
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Well, as we would recap just briefly the first two lessons from this series,

215
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
we said number one, because of who He is.

216
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Because He is God.

217
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,760
We dealt with His humanity and we dealt with His deity,

218
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,760
that He is God in flesh, 100% man, 100% God.

219
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,760
And we see those attributes throughout the Gospel accounts

220
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,760
and we find that as a man He was tired and sleeping in the ship,

221
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,760
but as God He came and He said, peace be still, and the winds and the waves obeyed.

222
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,760
We said this, number one, that Jesus is all the world to me because of who He is.

223
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Then we said this, because of His mighty power.

224
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Because of His mighty power.

225
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,760
We see that as we study the Gospel records that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed His power

226
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,760
over demons, over disease, over death, over nature.

227
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
We find that as you would study the Gospel records,

228
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
that the book of Matthew ends by Jesus proclaiming

229
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,760
that all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

230
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,760
And I am so thankful that He did not simply declare that He had all power,

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,760
but that throughout His earthly ministry He demonstrated His mighty power.

232
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
We said this, number three, that Jesus is all the world to me

233
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
because of His death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

234
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,760
The fact that as we study through the records and the Gospels

235
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,760
with regard to the crucifixion of Christ,

236
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
that we would be mindful of the suffering of Calvary.

237
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,760
And we would understand that He did that for me, that He took my place personally.

238
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,760
That He loved me so much that He was willing to endure

239
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,760
that great conflict and contradiction of sinners so that we might be redeemed.

240
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
What a wonderful Savior.

241
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
I am so thankful that He went to that borrowed tomb

242
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,760
and that He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

243
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
We then said this, number four,

244
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Jesus is all the world to me because of His work today.

245
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,760
The Bible teaches us that He is our great High Priest.

246
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
The Bible teaches us that He is our Intercessor.

247
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,760
The Bible teaches us that He is our Advocate.

248
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
In fact, the Bible teaches us,

249
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,760
and it will be a segue into our final point in our message today,

250
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,760
that He is preparing a place for me.

251
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
And so we have looked at these four things

252
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
as to why Jesus is all the world to me,

253
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,760
because of who He is, because of His mighty power,

254
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
because of His death, burial, and resurrection,

255
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
because of His work today.

256
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,760
And number five, if you're continuing to take notes,

257
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,760
I would say this, because He's coming back for me.

258
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Turn to the book of John, if you will,

259
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,760
and we'll be looking at a number of portions of Scripture

260
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
as we study through this final point of this lesson,

261
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Jesus is all the world to me.

262
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
In John 14, a familiar portion of Scripture,

263
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
but I want you to look at the words of this portion

264
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,760
to be encouraged by what Jesus is telling His disciples

265
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
and by the truth that is then relayed to us

266
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
as the people of God.

267
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,760
We understand that Jesus had given instruction to the disciples

268
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,760
with regard to His soon crucifixion

269
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
at the end of chapter 13.

270
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,800
a new commandment that they should love one another

271
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,020
even as He loved them.

272
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,260
And He said this,

273
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,300
"'By this, by your love one for another,

274
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,360
shall all men know that you are My disciples.'"

275
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,240
And what a blessing.

276
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
We find that the news of Calvary

277
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
and His being glorified

278
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,380
would bring the disciples to a place

279
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,980
of having heavy, troubled hearts, if you will.

280
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,040
And John 14 begins by Jesus saying to these disciples,

281
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,340
"'Let not your heart be troubled.'"

282
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,560
What a great statement.

283
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
Let not your heart be troubled.

284
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Why?

285
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,560
I mean, if He just stopped there

286
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,160
and did not give any reason

287
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,920
as to why the heart should not be troubled,

288
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,240
perhaps the disciples would have walked away

289
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,000
with troubled hearts.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,600
But Jesus says to these disciples,

291
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,840
"'Let not your heart be troubled.

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,440
Ye believe in God, believe also in Me.

293
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,040
In My Father's house are many mansions.

294
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,200
If it were not so, I would have told you.

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,960
I go to prepare a place for you.'"

296
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,200
Notice this.

297
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,240
"'And if I go and prepare a place for you,

298
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,360
I will come again

299
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,800
and receive you unto Myself,

300
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,520
that where I am, there ye may be also.'"

301
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,800
Now, I hope that as we look at the words

302
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,640
of this very familiar passage of Scripture,

303
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,360
that your heart is rejoicing

304
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,080
at the very truth that Jesus,

305
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,400
the Son of God,

306
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,440
the King of kings and Lord of lords,

307
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,600
is going to return one day for you.

308
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,080
For all of us collectively as the saints of God,

309
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,160
but just to be mindful of the fact

310
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,520
that individually He's coming for me.

311
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,560
What a blessing!

312
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,440
What joy should fill our hearts!

313
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
We think about this statement,

314
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,080
Jesus is all the world to me.

315
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,840
And I hope that you would say that He is.

316
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,520
Perhaps, even as we've mentioned

317
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,280
throughout this series,

318
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,440
there are many other reasons that we could give.

319
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,160
This is not in any way, shape, or form

320
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,320
an exhaustive list.

321
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,600
But we find that as we look at these pages of Scripture

322
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,400
and begin to try to give an answer

323
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,440
as to why Jesus is all the world to me,

324
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
think about this, because He's coming back for me.

325
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,120
He loves me so much,

326
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,680
He's going to come back for me.

327
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,440
We look here at this passage

328
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,800
and I believe with all of my heart

329
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,480
that the words that Jesus spoke to the disciples

330
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,400
on this particular day at this moment

331
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,000
were a great source of encouragement.

332
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,160
They would face some difficult moments ahead

333
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,760
as they would watch as their Savior was crucified,

334
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,080
as they would endure the days

335
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,160
in which He was in that tomb.

336
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,320
And then to think of going to that tomb

337
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,760
and finding that it was empty.

338
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
The resurrection.

339
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,080
All of the thoughts that would flood their minds.

340
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,360
The emotions that they would deal with.

341
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,320
And then as Jesus was ascended up into heaven

342
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,560
as the book of Acts records for us

343
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,200
in Acts 1,

344
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,400
and the disciples stood there and they beheld.

345
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,280
They saw Him go up into heaven.

346
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,680
The Bible says that they looked steadfastly

347
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,480
toward heaven as He went up.

348
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,440
There were two men that stood by them

349
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,760
in white apparel and they said,

350
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,040
you men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

351
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,280
This same Jesus,

352
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,560
which has taken up from you into heaven,

353
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,120
shall so come in like manner

354
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,240
as you have seen Him go into heaven.

355
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,800
Now, when these two men that were in white apparel,

356
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,240
angels I suppose,

357
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,840
as they gave this word of encouragement

358
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,960
to these disciples,

359
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,760
as they watched as Jesus was ascended up into heaven,

360
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,160
and they heard the message that said

361
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,800
this same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven,

362
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,200
shall so come in like manner

363
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
as you have seen Him go into heaven.

364
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,720
I just wonder as I study

365
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,000
and I look at this passage of Scripture,

366
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,520
I wonder if their minds race back to that day

367
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
where we started in John 14,

368
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,680
when they heard Jesus say,

369
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,320
I will come again and receive you unto Myself.

370
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
That where I am, there you may be also.

371
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,839
Perhaps when they heard the message

372
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,600
from these angels,

373
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,000
that they were reminded of what Jesus had said.

374
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,600
How it encouraged them.

375
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
How it strengthened them.

376
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
I'm mindful of the work that God accomplished

377
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,000
through His servants in the book of Acts

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
and the early church as you read.

379
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,119
You see all that's taking place

380
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,600
and all of the progress

381
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,480
and the way in which the Gospel is going forward.

382
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,200
And we have to be mindful of the fact

383
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,520
that they were living with a keen awareness

384
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,760
of the soon return of their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

385
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,240
I would submit to you today

386
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,240
that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,279
Listen for the trumpet as the songwriter said.

388
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,279
I believe that Jesus is coming soon.

389
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
We do not know when He's going to come.

390
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,800
In fact, here even in this same passage of Scripture

391
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,920
when the disciples asked Jesus in v. 6

392
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,320
if He would restore again the Kingdom to Israel,

393
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,240
He said to them,

394
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,600
it's not for them to know the times or seasons

395
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,960
which the Father hath put in His own power.

396
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,440
Our job is to be faithful,

397
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,320
to redeem the time,

398
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,320
because the days are evil.

399
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,920
To be faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

400
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,000
To be doers of the Word.

401
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
To be faithfully engaged in the work of God

402
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,960
even as I preached on Sunday evening

403
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,279
engaged in the work.

404
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,360
We understand the imminent return of Christ.

405
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
Because He's coming back for me

406
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,000
is one reason I would give

407
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,720
that Jesus is all the world to me.

408
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,440
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians if you will

409
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,680
and listen to what Paul tells these believers

410
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,680
in 1 Thessalonica.

411
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,559
These individuals had been

412
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,320
dealing with all sorts of difficulty

413
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,040
and they were a good church.

414
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
A model church.

415
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,360
A faithful group of believers.

416
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,440
And Paul is going to give them instruction here

417
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
in 1 Thessalonians 4

418
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,960
that has brought encouragement to my heart many times.

419
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
He begins in v. 13, he says,

420
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,839
but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

421
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,200
concerning them which are asleep.

422
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,880
That's referring to those that have died

423
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,600
as we'll find contextually in the passage of Scripture.

424
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
We understand that God wants us to be informed.

425
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,040
He does not want us to be ignorant.

426
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,040
He says that ye, sorrow not,

427
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,080
even as others which have no hope.

428
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,680
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

429
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
even so, them also which sleep in Jesus

430
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,160
will God bring with Him.

431
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,160
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

432
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,040
that we which are alive and remain

433
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,559
unto the coming of the Lord

434
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,920
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

435
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,720
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

436
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,760
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

437
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,559
and with the trump of God.

438
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,600
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

439
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,320
Then, we which are alive and remain

440
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,559
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

441
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,520
to meet the Lord in the air.

442
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,640
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

443
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,480
It ends with these words, verse 18,

444
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,080
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

445
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,680
How comforting these words are.

446
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,200
How encouraging these words are

447
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,240
to understand that Jesus is going to return

448
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,080
and to think about the truth of verse 17.

449
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,160
I don't know, we don't know if we'll be alive at the rapture

450
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,839
or if we'll be one of those that is mentioned earlier

451
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,840
that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

452
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,400
We're not sure, but the excitement would be

453
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,640
if we were alive, verse 17,

454
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
then we which are alive and remain,

455
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,320
notice what it says,

456
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,799
shall be caught up together with them,

457
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,160
that's the saints that have died in Christ,

458
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,679
the dead in Christ,

459
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,919
in the clouds, notice this,

460
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,359
to meet the Lord in the air.

461
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,960
And then it says this,

462
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,239
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

463
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:06,440
For all of eternity,

464
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,840
we'll have the great privilege of being with our Savior.

465
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,119
Isn't that wonderful?

466
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,080
It's encouraging. It's comforting.

467
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,679
It causes us to live life

468
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,400
and face the challenges of life

469
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,799
in a different manner.

470
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,280
Because we understand that we are strangers in pilgrims, right?

471
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,840
This world is not my home.

472
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,919
I'm just a passing through.

473
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

474
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
My citizenship is in heaven.

475
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,479
We are ambassadors,

476
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:40,479
as Paul says to the church in Corinth.

477
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,880
What a great privilege it is to know

478
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,679
that He's coming back for me.

479
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,640
The Bible continues to give us truth.

480
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,840
Turn to the book of Hebrews, if you will,

481
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,799
in regard to this promised return.

482
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,080
As we think about the promised return of our Savior,

483
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
we find that He...

484
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,020
Hebrews 9 and verse number 27,

485
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,820
a verse that we often will use

486
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,280
when we're speaking to people

487
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,720
about their need for Christ and for salvation.

488
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,320
This is,

489
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
"...as it is appointed unto men once to die,

490
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,160
but after this the judgment we find..."

491
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,080
Verse 28,

492
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:23,280
"...so Christ was once offered

493
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,000
to bear the sins of many,

494
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,560
and unto them that look for Him

495
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,240
shall He appear the second time

496
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,760
without sin unto salvation."

497
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,440
You notice that it says that He shall appear.

498
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
And I'm so thankful.

499
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,680
See, He's not going to have to come

500
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,480
another time to deal with sin.

501
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,160
He dealt with sin on His first coming.

502
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,840
We understand that He was born to die.

503
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,280
He was born as we just celebrated

504
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,520
the Christmas season

505
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,400
and spoke about the fact that He would come.

506
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,360
And we understood as Paul said

507
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,920
to the believers there in Galatia

508
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,400
that the Lord would come,

509
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,560
that God sent forth His Son.

510
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,200
When?

511
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,600
When the fullness of time was come,

512
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,840
that God sent forth His Son

513
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,440
made of a woman made under the law

514
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,360
to redeem them that were under the law

515
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,320
that would receive the adoption of sons.

516
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
How did He do that?

517
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,840
Redemption is through the blood of Christ.

518
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
And so sin has been dealt with

519
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,600
based on His first coming.

520
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,040
At His second coming,

521
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,000
He's not going to have to deal with sin

522
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,440
as far as the payment for sin.

523
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,240
And we find that we will have that privilege

524
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,840
at the rapture of the church

525
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,280
of being able to be with Him

526
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,560
for all of eternity.

527
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,640
In chapter 10 of the book of Hebrews,

528
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,320
in verse 37, notice what the Bible says.

529
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,760
For yet a little while,

530
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,280
and He that shall come will come,

531
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,880
and will not tarry.

532
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,360
Listen, Jesus came right on time

533
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,200
the first time.

534
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
When the fullness of time was come,

535
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,800
God sent forth His Son.

536
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,160
I just referenced that in Galatians 4

537
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,720
in verse number 4.

538
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,440
He's coming back right on time.

539
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,120
Sometimes we would say,

540
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,760
I wish it was sooner than later.

541
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm ready for Him to come today.

542
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,960
I feel you. I understand.

543
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,920
But the reality is that He's coming

544
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,800
right on time.

545
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,360
And His time is perfect.

546
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,520
His timing is perfect.

547
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,480
We see that throughout the pages of Scripture.

548
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
We don't have time to deal with that.

549
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,160
But we understand that His timing is perfect.

550
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
And I love that the Bible says

551
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,480
that yet a little while,

552
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,280
and He that shall come will come,

553
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,720
and will not tarry.

554
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,960
Notice in James chapter 5,

555
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,320
we're going to make our way through

556
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
a few more portions of Scripture

557
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,880
that end in the book of 1 John.

558
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,680
And Lord willing, it will help us

559
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,080
to not only be encouraged,

560
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,000
but challenged as we're mindful

561
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
of this truth that Jesus is coming back for me.

562
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,520
In James 5, notice in verse 7,

563
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,160
Be patient therefore, brethren,

564
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,360
unto the coming of the Lord.

565
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,600
Behold, the husbandman waiteth

566
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,480
for the precious fruit of the earth

567
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,120
and hath long patience for it

568
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,880
until he receive the early and latter rain.

569
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,360
Be ye also patient.

570
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,800
Establish your hearts.

571
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,560
For the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

572
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,680
As we look at verse 7 and understand

573
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,200
even as we just mentioned

574
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,960
that God's timing is perfect,

575
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,400
it tells us that the husbandman

576
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,440
waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth

577
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
and hath long patience for it.

578
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
We'd understand the picture there

579
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,080
of the agriculture reference that is given.

580
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,320
The way in which you sow, you plant,

581
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,400
you seek to cultivate,

582
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,080
and all that you do,

583
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,120
you water, etc.

584
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,240
So that you can receive that harvest.

585
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,200
And there's a requirement of patience

586
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,720
in receiving that harvest.

587
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,200
You don't plant today and reap tomorrow.

588
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,320
It doesn't work that way.

589
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,920
We think about the precious fruit of the earth

590
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,720
and we think about the souls

591
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,840
that would be saved

592
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,720
and just the joy of being able

593
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
to have one more person

594
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,440
have their name written in the Book of Life.

595
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,960
What a joy.

596
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,120
The Bible tells us in 2 Peter 3,

597
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,080
really as we think about that thought here

598
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,600
in James 5 and look at 2 Peter 3,

599
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,480
remember there were various scoffers

600
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,160
and things that were going on

601
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,720
during this particular time.

602
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,560
We see that it continues even today.

603
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
And one of the things that they would say

604
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,720
is where's the promise of His coming?

605
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,280
So thankful that He did promise

606
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,760
that He was coming.

607
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
And because He has not come

608
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,240
does not void the promise.

609
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,160
Because He did not say the day

610
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,760
or the hour that He would come.

611
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,400
He said He's coming and He's coming right on time.

612
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,720
And we find that Peter encouraged the believers

613
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,680
by telling them this in verse 9

614
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,320
of 2 Peter 3,

615
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,840
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

616
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,160
as some men count slackness.

617
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,600
But as longsuffering to us were,

618
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,040
not willing that any should perish,

619
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,840
but that all should come to repentance.

620
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,880
I'm so thankful that the Lord is not slack

621
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,440
concerning His promise.

622
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,200
You understand that God is not a man,

623
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,000
that He should lie.

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,760
We understand as we look at the pages of Scripture

625
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,840
and we are mindful of the truth

626
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,440
that our God is just a faithful God.

627
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,760
He's trustworthy.

628
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,560
He is dependable.

629
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,280
Paul said it this way in 2 Corinthians 1

630
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
and verse 20,

631
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,960
for all the promises of God in Him are yea,

632
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,040
and in Him, amen,

633
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,480
unto the glory of God by us.

634
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,000
Paul, as he's writing to Titus,

635
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
says this in hope of eternal life,

636
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,160
which God that cannot lie

637
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,800
promised before the world began.

638
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Listen, God has given many, many promises.

639
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,480
You find that He always does

640
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,000
what He says He will do.

641
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,360
I'm mindful of that very truth

642
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,240
even as we're studying through the book of Genesis

643
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,520
on Sunday evenings.

644
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,040
You see how God had made promises.

645
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,400
And He always does what He says He will do.

646
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,320
We serve a faithful God.

647
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,240
He's promised to come back for us.

648
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,560
And we can rest in that promise

649
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,040
knowing that He will return.

650
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,560
Finish with me in 1 John 2.

651
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
We'll read through the end of the chapter

652
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,480
and into the first few verses of the 3rd chapter.

653
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,080
In 1 John 2 and verse 28,

654
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,920
the Bible says,

655
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,320
"...now little children abide in Him,

656
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,440
that when He shall appear..."

657
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,560
Do you understand the language that we've been using

658
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,680
as we've studied the pages of Scripture,

659
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,560
the various portions that we've looked at

660
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,640
in this study?

661
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,680
It's never terminology or verbiage

662
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,680
that would have any indication

663
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,200
of uncertainty.

664
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,840
Rather, each passage that we've looked to

665
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,680
has revealed to us through the verbiage that is used

666
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,800
the absolute certainty.

667
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,560
When He shall appear.

668
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,480
Not if He shall appear,

669
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,280
but when He shall appear.

670
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,440
The Bible says, "...and now little children abide in Him,

671
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,200
that when He shall appear,

672
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
we may have confidence..."

673
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,040
Notice this.

674
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,160
"...and not be ashamed before Him at His coming."

675
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,080
I hope that there's not one among us

676
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,160
that would be ashamed at the coming of the Lord.

677
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,800
It's possible though.

678
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,880
One of my duties as a pastor

679
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,800
is to teach, to feed the flock of God.

680
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,000
To warn.

681
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,880
To instruct.

682
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,880
I would say this, it's to prepare you.

683
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,840
To prepare you for the coming of the Lord.

684
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,360
To prepare you for the standing

685
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,520
at the behemoth seat of Christ.

686
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
To give you instruction from the Word of God.

687
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,200
I cannot make you obey the Word of God.

688
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,600
It would not be right for me to do that.

689
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,840
I can simply preach and teach the truth

690
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,559
that is contained within this Word

691
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,640
and encourage you.

692
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,880
Tell you that it's in your best interest to obey.

693
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,920
To be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

694
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,040
The Bible says that we would be not ashamed

695
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,280
before Him at His coming.

696
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,600
I hope that not one of us,

697
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,880
a Fellowship Baptist church,

698
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,760
would be ashamed at His appearing.

699
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,360
The Bible continues in v. 29,

700
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,160
"...if you know that He is righteous,

701
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,600
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

702
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,720
is born of Him."

703
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,320
Notice v. 1 of chapter 3.

704
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,239
"...Behold, what manner of love

705
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,280
does the Father have bestowed upon us

706
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,640
that we should be called the sons of God."

707
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,960
Isn't that a precious title?

708
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,119
We're the sons of God.

709
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,200
Children of the King.

710
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,559
I'm a child of the King.

711
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,679
Complete in Christ.

712
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,600
"...Therefore, the world knoweth us not

713
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,000
because it knew Him not."

714
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

715
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,559
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

716
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,960
but we know that when he shall appear,

717
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,960
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

718
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,760
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself

719
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,280
even as he is pure."

720
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,760
It's important that we understand that word hope

721
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,079
in verse number 3 of chapter 3.

722
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,360
The word hope is used throughout the Bible.

723
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,319
In fact, Paul, as he's writing to Titus in Titus 2,

724
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,439
talks about the blessed hope and glorious appearing

725
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:42,240
of our great God and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

726
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,799
We read about the word hope, and the biblical definition

727
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:52,000
of that word hope is to have that confidence.

728
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Too often, we may allow the definitions

729
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,400
that are common today for our vocabulary

730
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,279
to influence our understanding of the Bible.

731
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,440
We might use that word hope today as a wishful thought,

732
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,040
wishful thinking kind of a manner.

733
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,360
I hope this happens, or I hope that happens.

734
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,919
But biblical hope is not in that vein.

735
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:20,720
Biblical hope is confidence.

736
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
What is it confident of?

737
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,360
It's confident of the promise of God.

738
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,599
We have this hope.

739
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,919
We have this confidence.

740
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:32,360
Because he said, why is it called the blessed hope?

741
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,000
Because it's based upon the truth

742
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,400
that God gave us, the very words that Jesus spoke.

743
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,239
And so we see that the Bible says

744
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:45,919
that we have this hope, and every man that hath this hope.

745
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,080
If you've been born again, if you're a child of God,

746
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,959
if you're a son of God, as it says here,

747
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:52,080
and you understand the teaching of Scripture,

748
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,559
if you understand that He is going to appear,

749
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,160
and you have that hope, notice the impact

750
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,760
that it has on our lives.

751
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,199
It says this, that He purifies Himself, even as He is pure.

752
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:14,520
Having that desire to be clean, to be pure.

753
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
We understand that we'll never reach a place

754
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,559
of sinless perfection.

755
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,880
But we understand that we have an advocate

756
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,559
with the Father.

757
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:29,720
We understand that our God is a God of forgiveness.

758
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,919
And we think about this truth of walking in the Spirit,

759
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,679
walking in the light as He is in the light.

760
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,399
This idea of purifying Himself, the idea of desiring

761
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:43,320
to be clean, to have no sin, to have no,

762
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,800
as the songwriter put it this way,

763
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,479
nothing between my soul and my Savior.

764
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:56,199
And we understand that the connection, if you will,

765
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,240
between 1 John 2, 28 and 1 John 3, verse number 3,

766
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,440
the way in which we can prevent being ashamed before Him

767
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,520
at His coming is by purifying ourselves.

768
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,960
I know I've mentioned this before,

769
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,039
but Holly was part of a music group in college.

770
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:15,520
And they would go and sing in various churches.

771
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,440
And one of the songs that they sang one of the years

772
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,559
that she was in the group was, Are You Ready?

773
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,240
And it would ask the question repeatedly through the song,

774
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,000
are you ready?

775
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,679
Are you ready?

776
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,160
Are you ready?

777
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,720
Are you ready?

778
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,960
Are you ready for the coming of the Lord?

779
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,839
Are you ready?

780
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:37,440
I know that oftentimes we say, Lord,

781
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,320
we're ready for You to come back, but are we?

782
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,160
Is it that we're ready for Him to come back

783
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,039
because we want to escape the trials and difficulties of life?

784
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,559
Or is it that we're ready for Him to come back

785
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,240
because we're ready to be in His presence for all of eternity?

786
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,080
And we're ready to be in His presence and to see Him.

787
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,520
We understand that the Lord is going to come back.

788
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,800
What precious, precious promise.

789
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,399
I hope that the promise would not only encourage us,

790
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,839
I hope that it would challenge us.

791
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,839
That we would purify ourselves.

792
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,600
That we would seek to be clean, to have revival in our lives.

793
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,559
Listen, Jesus is all the world to me.

794
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,760
Where would we be without Him?

795
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,279
I mean, the reality is that He's God.

796
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:34,640
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

797
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,279
Because of who He is.

798
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:38,480
He's God.

799
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,079
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

800
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,160
Because of His mighty power.

801
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,600
The power displayed during His earthly ministry

802
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:57,119
over death, disease, demons, nature.

803
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,559
All power is given unto Him, He said, in heaven and earth.

804
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:04,720
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

805
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,920
Because of His death, burial, and resurrection.

806
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,519
Because He died for me.

807
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:11,440
He paid for my sin.

808
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,279
He did for me what I couldn't do for myself

809
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:16,959
and what no one else could do for me.

810
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:20,200
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

811
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,359
Because of His work today.

812
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:24,399
Because He's my great High Priest.

813
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:26,000
He's my intercessor.

814
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,839
He's my advocate.

815
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,880
He's preparing a place for me.

816
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,600
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

817
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,559
Well, because He's coming back for me.

818
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,559
He's giving me a promise.

819
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,600
And that promise helps me every single day

820
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,480
on this journey called life.

821
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,320
Because I know that today could be the day

822
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,839
that He's going to come back for me.

823
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:53,600
Oh, I trust that your heart has been encouraged

824
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,839
over these past few weeks

825
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,119
on Wednesday evenings, this three-part series,

826
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,119
Jesus is all the world to me.

827
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,559
We're going to order prayer

828
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,920
and then we're going to sing this song together.

829
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,959
Jesus is all the world to me.

830
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:06,760
Let's pray.

831
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,959
Father, we love You.

832
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,079
Thank You for loving us.

833
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,679
Thank You for Your Word.

834
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:14,040
Lord, I know that there's so many other reasons

835
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,359
that we could give as to why

836
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:17,640
You're all the world to us,

837
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,679
but I pray that as we've just used this sampling

838
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,760
of five reasons,

839
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,839
God, You would stir us up and encourage us.

840
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,440
Thank You for our church family.

841
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,480
I thank You, God, for the work

842
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,720
that You're doing in our lives.

843
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,760
I pray that You'd help us

844
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,839
continue to grow spiritually,

845
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,040
to walk close with Thee,

846
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,000
to honor Thee.

847
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,959
We'll thank You for it.

848
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:48,079
In Christ's name we pray,

849
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,079
Amen.
