WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
All right, this is our midweek service and first Wednesday evening of January.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.200
We're actually pre recording the message here on Tuesday morning, and I'll be sending out

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.760
an email with some information as to why we did things this way.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.920
But of course, if you'd continue to pray for our family with the fact that we're exposed

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.920
to someone who tested positive with COVID, and we just trust that God would keep us safe

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.000
and certainly miss you.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.740
And we're praying for you looking forward to seeing you soon.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.840
And again, I'll be sending out an email, but we're going to start our service by singing

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.240
channels only one of my favorite hymns.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.759
It's number 477, our hymnal and Joseph's going to help us lead in songs again, number 477

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Channels only, blessed master, God with all thy wondrous power

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.760
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.760
Every day and every hour

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.759
Witnessing thy power to save me

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.759
Seeking free from self and sin

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.759
Thou who brought this to possess me

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.759
In thy fullness, Lord, come in

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:26.759
Channels only, blessed master

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.759
God with all thy wondrous power

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.759
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:40.759
Every day and every hour

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.759
Jesus, fill now with thy spirit

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.759
Hearts that will surrender, know

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.759
That the streams of living water

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.759
From our inner man may flow

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:02.759
Channels only, blessed master

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.759
God with all thy wondrous power

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.759
Flowing through us, thou canst use us

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:16.759
Every day and every hour

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.759
Well, amen, I appreciate Joseph's willingness to help out and lead songs

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:28.759
and certainly appreciate that and I want to encourage you

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.759
that we serve a great God and that he would use us

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.759
Isn't that amazing? Channels only

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.759
and to think about the fact that God would use us

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.759
and that he would fill us and he would enable us

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.759
and then he would use us for his honor and for his glory

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.759
and it is my desire that God would use me

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
and I trust that you have that same desire

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.759
We certainly thank the Lord for the opportunities of technology

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:56.759
and thankful for our team that has worked so tirelessly

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.759
over the last year, really more than that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.759
but especially over this last year

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.759
in order to get all of these audiovisual things up to speed

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
so that we can do all of these things that we need to do

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.759
and very much appreciate their service in that capacity

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.759
Let's go to the Lord in prayer

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.759
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.760
We thank you for the blessings in which you have bestowed upon us

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
We thank you for your grace and your mercy

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.760
We thank you, God, for the word of God

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.760
We pray that you would just speak to our hearts as we open the scriptures

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.760
I pray that you would help us to be challenged and encouraged and comforted

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.760
I pray, God, that you would help us to make decisions that would please thee

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.760
I pray, Father, that you would help each one to be attentive and responsive

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.760
I pray that we'd be helped through thy word

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
We do think of those that are continuing to struggle with some health needs

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760
Lord, we pray that you'd meet each need

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760
that you'd be gracious and merciful

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.760
We thank you that you're the great physician

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760
We thank you that you've given us the instruction

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760
that if any are sick, that we're to pray

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.760
and God, we ask that you'd work in a distinct way as only you could

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760
We pray that you would be glorified

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.760
We thank you and praise you for all that you'll do

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.760
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760
I do want to encourage you to continue to pray

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.760
for Virginia and Yolanda and the Petersons

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760
and then also if you would pray for the Ronnie

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.760
with his back and for his mom also, Miss Anne Hall

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.760
and we are certainly thankful for the way in which God has answered prayer

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760
and shown himself faithful

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.760
and we serve a great God

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.760
I hope that you have been encouraged these last few days

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.760
as you have considered the new theme for this year

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760
Complete in Christ

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.760
and what a blessing

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.760
and so excited about the prospect of going through the book of Colossians

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.760
and studying through that book verse by verse this calendar year

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
in our morning services on Sunday

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760
and trust that you will be encouraged and strengthened

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.760
We do have daily devotionals and church calendars

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.760
and also sermon notebooks

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.760
with some instructions on how you'll be able to get those

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.760
and we've worked out a plan so that we can get those distributed

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.760
and I certainly apologize for the delay on being able to get those things distributed

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.760
but with this exposure to COVID we have to be extremely cautious

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.760
and I want to make sure that we're doing all that we're supposed to do

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.760
It is exciting as you pull up the driveway at church

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.760
to see the construction of the parsonage

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760
and I want you to continue to pray

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.760
if you will for that project that things would continue to move forward

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.760
but it certainly is exciting to see a structure coming there

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.760
and looking forward to soon seeing that project completed

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760
and being able to take occupancy

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.760
and your prayers are greatly appreciated

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.760
and I want to also remind you

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.760
to pray for the Savali family I mentioned on Sunday

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.760
about their situation there with the new church plant

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.760
and so if you would continue to pray for wisdom and direction

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760
that God would just guide them and direct them

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.760
and it's exciting to see the hand of the Lord at work in that situation

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.760
and they've kind of, as Brother Savali has termed it

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.760
it's a fluid situation

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.760
and they have received yes and then no and then yes again

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.760
but we know that God is working

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.760
and we know that the cause of Christ is moving forward

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
the people of God are being encouraged

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.760
and so please do continue to pray

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.760
and we look forward to being able to provide you with more updates

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760
as we receive those from Brother Savali

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760
at this time we'll have our offering

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760
and so I'll pray for the offering

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.760
thank you again for your faithfulness in giving

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760
not only for the ministry here

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.760
as we seek to reach our community

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.760
but also in the supporting of missionaries around the globe

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.760
so that we could see the gospel move forward

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.760
Father we thank you for the privilege of giving

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.760
we acknowledge that all that we have is because of your grace

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.760
and because of your good hand of blessing that's been upon us

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.760
God we thank you for the opportunity

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.760
what a privilege it is to be able to give back to you

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.760
to participate in the work of God through our finances

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.760
I pray that you take and bless the offering

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.760
use it for the furtherance of the ministry here and around the globe

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
and we'll thank you for it

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.760
in Christ's name we pray, amen

We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:04.760
If they lead through the temple holy, preaching the word.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:12.760
Or in homes of the poor and lowly, serving the Lord.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:20.760

Good Prince of Jesus, and make the pathway glow.

We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.760
Well, amen.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.760
Again, I'm so thankful for the blessings of being able to use the technology that God has given us.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.760
And thankful for Holly playing the piano and Joseph being willing to lead the songs.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760
And certainly a blessing to me.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.760
And I trust the service will be a blessing to you as well.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:33.760
And we're very thankful for the opportunity of being able to continue in our series from Wednesday evening.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.760
As we wrapped up last year, we were still dealing with the subject matter of sound doctrine.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:50.760
And as we're looking at sound doctrine and dealing with all of those particular subjects that we've been dealing with.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.760
We have had the opportunity to look at the doctrine of Christ.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.760
And we have been looking here for a number of weeks now at the doctrine of Christ.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:09.760
And the particular subject in which we're dealing with, this will be part three of a sermon series titled,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.760
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.760
And we started that back on December the 9th.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.760
And again, we had part one and part two.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.760
And today we will finish up this three-part series as to Jesus is all the world to me.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.760
And I kind of asked this question, if you were to say Jesus is all the world to you.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.760
And someone said, why? Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.760
What would you say? How would you respond to that question?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.760
The reality is that we started looking at the doctrine of Christ in that great passage of Scripture in Matthew 16.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:53.760
When Jesus asked the question to the disciples, he said, whom do men say that I am?

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:01.760
And we understand that when Jesus asked that question, that the response of the disciples reveals to us

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.760
that there was a great amount of confusion amongst the people.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:12.760
Why? Because they responded and said, well, some say that you're John the Baptist, Isaiah, Jeremiah, one of the prophets.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.760
And then Jesus looks to his disciples and he says, but whom do ye say that I am?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:27.760
And Peter stands and what a great declaration when he said, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.760
And it's important that we understand who Jesus is, that he is God in flesh.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.760
We understand that he is Messiah, the promised one, the anointed one.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.760
We understand that he came with a purpose to live a perfect and sinless life,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.760
to go to the cross of Calvary, to shed his precious blood,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.760
to be buried in a borrowed tomb, to rise conquering sin, death, and the grave,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.760
to be ascended to heaven where he lives even now, ever interceding for us.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.760
And one day, one glorious day, he will come and receive us unto himself.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.760
And what a joy it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.760
What a joy it is that we have this book, the Bible.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.760
And the songwriter said, Jesus is all the world to me.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.760
And I think about what Peter said.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.760
Peter proclaimed there in Matthew 16, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.760
But then it was Peter that God used in the book of 1 Peter.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.760
And I'd invite you to turn in your Bibles to 1 Peter, chapter number 2.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.760
And I want you to notice what Peter says.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.760
We use this portion of Scripture in our last study as well.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.760
But it's so important for us to understand and to see how God would use Peter

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.760
and the way in which he would communicate this great truth to us.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.760
The Bible says in verse number 3 of 1 Peter, chapter number 2,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.760
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.760
I'm so thankful that our God is gracious.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.760
And then if you skip down to verse number 7, the Bible says this,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:08.760
unto you therefore which believe, He is precious.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.760
If you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.760
if you have believed and you've received Him as your Savior,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.760
I believe this day that you would say, He is precious.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.760
And we would say as the songwriter wrote that great hymn, Jesus is all the world to me.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760
Why?

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.760
Well, as we would recap just briefly the first two lessons from this series,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
we said number one, because of who He is.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.760
Because He is God.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.760
We dealt with His humanity and we dealt with His deity,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.760
that He is God in flesh, 100% man, 100% God.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.760
And we see those attributes throughout the Gospel accounts

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.760
and we find that as a man He was tired and sleeping in the ship,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.760
but as God He came and He said, peace be still, and the winds and the waves obeyed.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.760
We said this, number one, that Jesus is all the world to me because of who He is.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.760
Then we said this, because of His mighty power.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.760
Because of His mighty power.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.760
We see that as we study the Gospel records that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed His power

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.760
over demons, over disease, over death, over nature.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.760
We find that as you would study the Gospel records,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.760
that the book of Matthew ends by Jesus proclaiming

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.760
that all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.760
And I am so thankful that He did not simply declare that He had all power,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.760
but that throughout His earthly ministry He demonstrated His mighty power.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.760
We said this, number three, that Jesus is all the world to me

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760
because of His death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.760
The fact that as we study through the records and the Gospels

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.760
with regard to the crucifixion of Christ,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.760
that we would be mindful of the suffering of Calvary.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.760
And we would understand that He did that for me, that He took my place personally.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.760
That He loved me so much that He was willing to endure

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:17.760
that great conflict and contradiction of sinners so that we might be redeemed.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.760
What a wonderful Savior.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.760
I am so thankful that He went to that borrowed tomb

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760
and that He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.760
We then said this, number four,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.760
Jesus is all the world to me because of His work today.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.760
The Bible teaches us that He is our great High Priest.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.760
The Bible teaches us that He is our Intercessor.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.760
The Bible teaches us that He is our Advocate.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.760
In fact, the Bible teaches us,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.760
and it will be a segue into our final point in our message today,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.760
that He is preparing a place for me.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.760
And so we have looked at these four things

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.760
as to why Jesus is all the world to me,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.760
because of who He is, because of His mighty power,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.760
because of His death, burial, and resurrection,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.760
because of His work today.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.760
And number five, if you're continuing to take notes,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.760
I would say this, because He's coming back for me.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.760
Turn to the book of John, if you will,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.760
and we'll be looking at a number of portions of Scripture

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.760
as we study through this final point of this lesson,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.760
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.760
In John 14, a familiar portion of Scripture,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.760
but I want you to look at the words of this portion

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.760
to be encouraged by what Jesus is telling His disciples

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.760
and by the truth that is then relayed to us

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.760
as the people of God.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.760
We understand that Jesus had given instruction to the disciples

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.760
with regard to His soon crucifixion

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.760
at the end of chapter 13.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.800
a new commandment that they should love one another

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.020
even as He loved them.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.260
And He said this,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.300
"'By this, by your love one for another,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.360
shall all men know that you are My disciples.'"

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.240
And what a blessing.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.400
We find that the news of Calvary

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.100
and His being glorified

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.380
would bring the disciples to a place

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.980
of having heavy, troubled hearts, if you will.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.040
And John 14 begins by Jesus saying to these disciples,

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.340
"'Let not your heart be troubled.'"

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.560
What a great statement.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.480
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480
Why?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.560
I mean, if He just stopped there

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.160
and did not give any reason

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.920
as to why the heart should not be troubled,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.240
perhaps the disciples would have walked away

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.000
with troubled hearts.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.600
But Jesus says to these disciples,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.840
"'Let not your heart be troubled.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.440
Ye believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.040
In My Father's house are many mansions.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.200
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.960
I go to prepare a place for you.'"

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.200
Notice this.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.240
"'And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.360
I will come again

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.800
and receive you unto Myself,

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.520
that where I am, there ye may be also.'"

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.800
Now, I hope that as we look at the words

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.640
of this very familiar passage of Scripture,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.360
that your heart is rejoicing

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.080
at the very truth that Jesus,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.400
the Son of God,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.440
the King of kings and Lord of lords,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.600
is going to return one day for you.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.080
For all of us collectively as the saints of God,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.160
but just to be mindful of the fact

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.520
that individually He's coming for me.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.560
What a blessing!

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.440
What joy should fill our hearts!

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.960
We think about this statement,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.080
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.840
And I hope that you would say that He is.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.520
Perhaps, even as we've mentioned

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.280
throughout this series,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.440
there are many other reasons that we could give.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.160
This is not in any way, shape, or form

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.320
an exhaustive list.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.600
But we find that as we look at these pages of Scripture

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.400
and begin to try to give an answer

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.440
as to why Jesus is all the world to me,

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.720
think about this, because He's coming back for me.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.120
He loves me so much,

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.680
He's going to come back for me.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.440
We look here at this passage

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.800
and I believe with all of my heart

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.480
that the words that Jesus spoke to the disciples

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.400
on this particular day at this moment

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.000
were a great source of encouragement.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.160
They would face some difficult moments ahead

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.760
as they would watch as their Savior was crucified,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.080
as they would endure the days

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.160
in which He was in that tomb.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.320
And then to think of going to that tomb

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.760
and finding that it was empty.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.320
The resurrection.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.080
All of the thoughts that would flood their minds.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.360
The emotions that they would deal with.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.320
And then as Jesus was ascended up into heaven

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.560
as the book of Acts records for us

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.200
in Acts 1,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.400
and the disciples stood there and they beheld.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.280
They saw Him go up into heaven.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.680
The Bible says that they looked steadfastly

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.480
toward heaven as He went up.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.440
There were two men that stood by them

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.760
in white apparel and they said,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.040
you men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.280
This same Jesus,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.560
which has taken up from you into heaven,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.120
shall so come in like manner

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.240
as you have seen Him go into heaven.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.800
Now, when these two men that were in white apparel,

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.240
angels I suppose,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.840
as they gave this word of encouragement

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.960
to these disciples,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.760
as they watched as Jesus was ascended up into heaven,

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.160
and they heard the message that said

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.800
this same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.200
shall so come in like manner

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.440
as you have seen Him go into heaven.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.720
I just wonder as I study

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.000
and I look at this passage of Scripture,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.520
I wonder if their minds race back to that day

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.240
where we started in John 14,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.680
when they heard Jesus say,

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.320
I will come again and receive you unto Myself.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.720
That where I am, there you may be also.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.839
Perhaps when they heard the message

00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:50.600
from these angels,

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:57.000
that they were reminded of what Jesus had said.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.600
How it encouraged them.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.480
How it strengthened them.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.279
I'm mindful of the work that God accomplished

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:08.000
through His servants in the book of Acts

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.360
and the early church as you read.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.119
You see all that's taking place

00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:13.600
and all of the progress

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.480
and the way in which the Gospel is going forward.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.200
And we have to be mindful of the fact

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.520
that they were living with a keen awareness

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.760
of the soon return of their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.240
I would submit to you today

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.240
that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.279
Listen for the trumpet as the songwriter said.

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:39.279
I believe that Jesus is coming soon.

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.200
We do not know when He's going to come.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.800
In fact, here even in this same passage of Scripture

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.920
when the disciples asked Jesus in v. 6

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.320
if He would restore again the Kingdom to Israel,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.240
He said to them,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.600
it's not for them to know the times or seasons

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.960
which the Father hath put in His own power.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.440
Our job is to be faithful,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.320
to redeem the time,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.320
because the days are evil.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.920
To be faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.000
To be doers of the Word.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.240
To be faithfully engaged in the work of God

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.960
even as I preached on Sunday evening

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.279
engaged in the work.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:18.360
We understand the imminent return of Christ.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.920
Because He's coming back for me

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.000
is one reason I would give

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.720
that Jesus is all the world to me.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.440
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians if you will

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.680
and listen to what Paul tells these believers

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.680
in 1 Thessalonica.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.559
These individuals had been

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:38.320
dealing with all sorts of difficulty

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.040
and they were a good church.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.040
A model church.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.360
A faithful group of believers.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.440
And Paul is going to give them instruction here

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.720
in 1 Thessalonians 4

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.960
that has brought encouragement to my heart many times.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.640
He begins in v. 13, he says,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.839
but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:02.200
concerning them which are asleep.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.880
That's referring to those that have died

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.600
as we'll find contextually in the passage of Scripture.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.080
We understand that God wants us to be informed.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.040
He does not want us to be ignorant.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.040
He says that ye, sorrow not,

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.080
even as others which have no hope.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.680
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.640
even so, them also which sleep in Jesus

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.160
will God bring with Him.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.160
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.040
that we which are alive and remain

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.559
unto the coming of the Lord

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:41.920
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.720
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.760
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.559
and with the trump of God.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.600
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.320
Then, we which are alive and remain

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.559
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:59.520
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.640
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.480
It ends with these words, verse 18,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.080
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.680
How comforting these words are.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.200
How encouraging these words are

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.240
to understand that Jesus is going to return

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.080
and to think about the truth of verse 17.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.160
I don't know, we don't know if we'll be alive at the rapture

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.839
or if we'll be one of those that is mentioned earlier

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:32.840
that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.400
We're not sure, but the excitement would be

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.640
if we were alive, verse 17,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.679
then we which are alive and remain,

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.320
notice what it says,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.799
shall be caught up together with them,

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:49.160
that's the saints that have died in Christ,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.679
the dead in Christ,

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.919
in the clouds, notice this,

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:57.359
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:28:57.359 --> 00:28:58.960
And then it says this,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.239
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:06.440
For all of eternity,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.840
we'll have the great privilege of being with our Savior.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.119
Isn't that wonderful?

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.080
It's encouraging. It's comforting.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.679
It causes us to live life

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:20.400
and face the challenges of life

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.799
in a different manner.

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:26.280
Because we understand that we are strangers in pilgrims, right?

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.840
This world is not my home.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.919
I'm just a passing through.

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:33.720
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.400
My citizenship is in heaven.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.479
We are ambassadors,

00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:40.479
as Paul says to the church in Corinth.

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:42.880
What a great privilege it is to know

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.679
that He's coming back for me.

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.640
The Bible continues to give us truth.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.840
Turn to the book of Hebrews, if you will,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.799
in regard to this promised return.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:58.080
As we think about the promised return of our Savior,

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.080
we find that He...

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.020
Hebrews 9 and verse number 27,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.820
a verse that we often will use

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.280
when we're speaking to people

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.720
about their need for Christ and for salvation.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.320
This is,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.240
"...as it is appointed unto men once to die,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.160
but after this the judgment we find..."

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.080
Verse 28,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:23.280
"...so Christ was once offered

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.000
to bear the sins of many,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.560
and unto them that look for Him

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.240
shall He appear the second time

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.760
without sin unto salvation."

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.440
You notice that it says that He shall appear.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.920
And I'm so thankful.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.680
See, He's not going to have to come

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.480
another time to deal with sin.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.160
He dealt with sin on His first coming.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.840
We understand that He was born to die.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.280
He was born as we just celebrated

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.520
the Christmas season

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.400
and spoke about the fact that He would come.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.360
And we understood as Paul said

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.920
to the believers there in Galatia

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.400
that the Lord would come,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.560
that God sent forth His Son.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.200
When?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.600
When the fullness of time was come,

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.840
that God sent forth His Son

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.440
made of a woman made under the law

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.360
to redeem them that were under the law

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.320
that would receive the adoption of sons.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320
How did He do that?

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.840
Redemption is through the blood of Christ.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.640
And so sin has been dealt with

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.600
based on His first coming.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.040
At His second coming,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.000
He's not going to have to deal with sin

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.440
as far as the payment for sin.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.240
And we find that we will have that privilege

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.840
at the rapture of the church

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.280
of being able to be with Him

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.560
for all of eternity.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.640
In chapter 10 of the book of Hebrews,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.320
in verse 37, notice what the Bible says.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.760
For yet a little while,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.280
and He that shall come will come,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.880
and will not tarry.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.360
Listen, Jesus came right on time

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.200
the first time.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.640
When the fullness of time was come,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.800
God sent forth His Son.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.160
I just referenced that in Galatians 4

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.720
in verse number 4.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.440
He's coming back right on time.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.120
Sometimes we would say,

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.760
I wish it was sooner than later.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.600
I'm ready for Him to come today.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.960
I feel you. I understand.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.920
But the reality is that He's coming

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.800
right on time.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.360
And His time is perfect.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.520
His timing is perfect.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.480
We see that throughout the pages of Scripture.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.480
We don't have time to deal with that.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.160
But we understand that His timing is perfect.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.360
And I love that the Bible says

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.480
that yet a little while,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.280
and He that shall come will come,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.720
and will not tarry.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.960
Notice in James chapter 5,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.320
we're going to make our way through

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.240
a few more portions of Scripture

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.880
that end in the book of 1 John.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.680
And Lord willing, it will help us

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.080
to not only be encouraged,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.000
but challenged as we're mindful

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
of this truth that Jesus is coming back for me.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.520
In James 5, notice in verse 7,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.160
Be patient therefore, brethren,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.360
unto the coming of the Lord.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.600
Behold, the husbandman waiteth

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.480
for the precious fruit of the earth

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.120
and hath long patience for it

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.880
until he receive the early and latter rain.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.360
Be ye also patient.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.800
Establish your hearts.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.560
For the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.680
As we look at verse 7 and understand

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.200
even as we just mentioned

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.960
that God's timing is perfect,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.400
it tells us that the husbandman

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.440
waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.600
and hath long patience for it.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.800
We'd understand the picture there

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.080
of the agriculture reference that is given.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.320
The way in which you sow, you plant,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.400
you seek to cultivate,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.080
and all that you do,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.120
you water, etc.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.240
So that you can receive that harvest.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.200
And there's a requirement of patience

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.720
in receiving that harvest.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.200
You don't plant today and reap tomorrow.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.320
It doesn't work that way.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.920
We think about the precious fruit of the earth

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.720
and we think about the souls

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.840
that would be saved

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.720
and just the joy of being able

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.720
to have one more person

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.440
have their name written in the Book of Life.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.960
What a joy.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.120
The Bible tells us in 2 Peter 3,

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.080
really as we think about that thought here

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.600
in James 5 and look at 2 Peter 3,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.480
remember there were various scoffers

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.160
and things that were going on

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.720
during this particular time.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.560
We see that it continues even today.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.560
And one of the things that they would say

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.720
is where's the promise of His coming?

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.280
So thankful that He did promise

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.760
that He was coming.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.160
And because He has not come

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.240
does not void the promise.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.160
Because He did not say the day

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.760
or the hour that He would come.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.400
He said He's coming and He's coming right on time.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.720
And we find that Peter encouraged the believers

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.680
by telling them this in verse 9

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.320
of 2 Peter 3,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.840
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.160
as some men count slackness.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.600
But as longsuffering to us were,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.040
not willing that any should perish,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.840
but that all should come to repentance.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.880
I'm so thankful that the Lord is not slack

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.440
concerning His promise.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.200
You understand that God is not a man,

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.000
that He should lie.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.760
We understand as we look at the pages of Scripture

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.840
and we are mindful of the truth

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.440
that our God is just a faithful God.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.760
He's trustworthy.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.560
He is dependable.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.280
Paul said it this way in 2 Corinthians 1

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.280
and verse 20,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.960
for all the promises of God in Him are yea,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.040
and in Him, amen,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.480
unto the glory of God by us.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.000
Paul, as he's writing to Titus,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.920
says this in hope of eternal life,

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.160
which God that cannot lie

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.800
promised before the world began.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:23.400
Listen, God has given many, many promises.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.480
You find that He always does

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.000
what He says He will do.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.360
I'm mindful of that very truth

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.240
even as we're studying through the book of Genesis

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.520
on Sunday evenings.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.040
You see how God had made promises.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.400
And He always does what He says He will do.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.320
We serve a faithful God.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.240
He's promised to come back for us.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.560
And we can rest in that promise

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.040
knowing that He will return.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.560
Finish with me in 1 John 2.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.320
We'll read through the end of the chapter

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.480
and into the first few verses of the 3rd chapter.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.080
In 1 John 2 and verse 28,

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.920
the Bible says,

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.320
"...now little children abide in Him,

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.440
that when He shall appear..."

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.560
Do you understand the language that we've been using

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.680
as we've studied the pages of Scripture,

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.560
the various portions that we've looked at

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.640
in this study?

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.680
It's never terminology or verbiage

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.680
that would have any indication

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.200
of uncertainty.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.840
Rather, each passage that we've looked to

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.680
has revealed to us through the verbiage that is used

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.800
the absolute certainty.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.560
When He shall appear.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.480
Not if He shall appear,

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.280
but when He shall appear.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.440
The Bible says, "...and now little children abide in Him,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.200
that when He shall appear,

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.440
we may have confidence..."

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.040
Notice this.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:04.160
"...and not be ashamed before Him at His coming."

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.080
I hope that there's not one among us

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.160
that would be ashamed at the coming of the Lord.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.800
It's possible though.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.880
One of my duties as a pastor

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.800
is to teach, to feed the flock of God.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.000
To warn.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.880
To instruct.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.880
I would say this, it's to prepare you.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.840
To prepare you for the coming of the Lord.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.360
To prepare you for the standing

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.520
at the behemoth seat of Christ.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520
To give you instruction from the Word of God.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.200
I cannot make you obey the Word of God.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.600
It would not be right for me to do that.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.840
I can simply preach and teach the truth

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.559
that is contained within this Word

00:38:49.559 --> 00:38:52.640
and encourage you.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.880
Tell you that it's in your best interest to obey.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.920
To be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.040
The Bible says that we would be not ashamed

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.280
before Him at His coming.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.600
I hope that not one of us,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.880
a Fellowship Baptist church,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.760
would be ashamed at His appearing.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.360
The Bible continues in v. 29,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.160
"...if you know that He is righteous,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.600
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.720
is born of Him."

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.320
Notice v. 1 of chapter 3.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.239
"...Behold, what manner of love

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.280
does the Father have bestowed upon us

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.640
that we should be called the sons of God."

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.960
Isn't that a precious title?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.119
We're the sons of God.

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:43.200
Children of the King.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.559
I'm a child of the King.

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:48.679
Complete in Christ.

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:50.600
"...Therefore, the world knoweth us not

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.000
because it knew Him not."

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.559
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:07.960
but we know that when he shall appear,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.960
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.760
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.280
even as he is pure."

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.760
It's important that we understand that word hope

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.079
in verse number 3 of chapter 3.

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:33.360
The word hope is used throughout the Bible.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.319
In fact, Paul, as he's writing to Titus in Titus 2,

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:38.439
talks about the blessed hope and glorious appearing

00:40:38.439 --> 00:40:42.240
of our great God and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.799
We read about the word hope, and the biblical definition

00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:52.000
of that word hope is to have that confidence.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Too often, we may allow the definitions

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.400
that are common today for our vocabulary

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.279
to influence our understanding of the Bible.

00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:06.440
We might use that word hope today as a wishful thought,

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.040
wishful thinking kind of a manner.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.360
I hope this happens, or I hope that happens.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.919
But biblical hope is not in that vein.

00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:20.720
Biblical hope is confidence.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.160
What is it confident of?

00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:25.360
It's confident of the promise of God.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.599
We have this hope.

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:28.919
We have this confidence.

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:32.360
Because he said, why is it called the blessed hope?

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.000
Because it's based upon the truth

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.400
that God gave us, the very words that Jesus spoke.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.239
And so we see that the Bible says

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:45.919
that we have this hope, and every man that hath this hope.

00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:48.080
If you've been born again, if you're a child of God,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.959
if you're a son of God, as it says here,

00:41:49.959 --> 00:41:52.080
and you understand the teaching of Scripture,

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.559
if you understand that He is going to appear,

00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:57.160
and you have that hope, notice the impact

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.760
that it has on our lives.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.199
It says this, that He purifies Himself, even as He is pure.

00:42:08.039 --> 00:42:14.520
Having that desire to be clean, to be pure.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.320
We understand that we'll never reach a place

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.559
of sinless perfection.

00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:21.880
But we understand that we have an advocate

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.559
with the Father.

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:29.720
We understand that our God is a God of forgiveness.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.919
And we think about this truth of walking in the Spirit,

00:42:33.919 --> 00:42:36.679
walking in the light as He is in the light.

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:40.399
This idea of purifying Himself, the idea of desiring

00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:43.320
to be clean, to have no sin, to have no,

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.800
as the songwriter put it this way,

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.479
nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:56.199
And we understand that the connection, if you will,

00:42:56.199 --> 00:43:01.240
between 1 John 2, 28 and 1 John 3, verse number 3,

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.440
the way in which we can prevent being ashamed before Him

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.520
at His coming is by purifying ourselves.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.960
I know I've mentioned this before,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.039
but Holly was part of a music group in college.

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:15.520
And they would go and sing in various churches.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.440
And one of the songs that they sang one of the years

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.559
that she was in the group was, Are You Ready?

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:26.240
And it would ask the question repeatedly through the song,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.000
are you ready?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.679
Are you ready?

00:43:27.679 --> 00:43:28.160
Are you ready?

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.720
Are you ready?

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.960
Are you ready for the coming of the Lord?

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.839
Are you ready?

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:37.440
I know that oftentimes we say, Lord,

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.320
we're ready for You to come back, but are we?

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.160
Is it that we're ready for Him to come back

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:48.039
because we want to escape the trials and difficulties of life?

00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:49.559
Or is it that we're ready for Him to come back

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:53.240
because we're ready to be in His presence for all of eternity?

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:59.080
And we're ready to be in His presence and to see Him.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.520
We understand that the Lord is going to come back.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.800
What precious, precious promise.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.399
I hope that the promise would not only encourage us,

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.839
I hope that it would challenge us.

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.839
That we would purify ourselves.

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:21.600
That we would seek to be clean, to have revival in our lives.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.559
Listen, Jesus is all the world to me.

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:26.760
Where would we be without Him?

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.279
I mean, the reality is that He's God.

00:44:32.279 --> 00:44:34.640
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.279
Because of who He is.

00:44:36.279 --> 00:44:38.480
He's God.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.079
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:43.160
Because of His mighty power.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.600
The power displayed during His earthly ministry

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:57.119
over death, disease, demons, nature.

00:44:57.119 --> 00:45:01.559
All power is given unto Him, He said, in heaven and earth.

00:45:01.559 --> 00:45:04.720
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.920
Because of His death, burial, and resurrection.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.519
Because He died for me.

00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:11.440
He paid for my sin.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.279
He did for me what I couldn't do for myself

00:45:14.279 --> 00:45:16.959
and what no one else could do for me.

00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:20.200
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.359
Because of His work today.

00:45:22.359 --> 00:45:24.399
Because He's my great High Priest.

00:45:24.399 --> 00:45:26.000
He's my intercessor.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.839
He's my advocate.

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.880
He's preparing a place for me.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.600
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.559
Well, because He's coming back for me.

00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:38.559
He's giving me a promise.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.600
And that promise helps me every single day

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.480
on this journey called life.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.320
Because I know that today could be the day

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.839
that He's going to come back for me.

00:45:50.839 --> 00:45:53.600
Oh, I trust that your heart has been encouraged

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.839
over these past few weeks

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:58.119
on Wednesday evenings, this three-part series,

00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:00.119
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:01.559
We're going to order prayer

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:03.920
and then we're going to sing this song together.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.959
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:46:05.959 --> 00:46:06.760
Let's pray.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.959
Father, we love You.

00:46:07.959 --> 00:46:09.079
Thank You for loving us.

00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:11.679
Thank You for Your Word.

00:46:11.679 --> 00:46:14.040
Lord, I know that there's so many other reasons

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.359
that we could give as to why

00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:17.640
You're all the world to us,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.679
but I pray that as we've just used this sampling

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:24.760
of five reasons,

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.839
God, You would stir us up and encourage us.

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:32.440
Thank You for our church family.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.480
I thank You, God, for the work

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.720
that You're doing in our lives.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.760
I pray that You'd help us

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.839
continue to grow spiritually,

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:43.040
to walk close with Thee,

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.000
to honor Thee.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.959
We'll thank You for it.

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:48.079
In Christ's name we pray,

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:49.079
Amen.
